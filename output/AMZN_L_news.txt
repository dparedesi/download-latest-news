Year Ender 2025: 2025 saw massive job cuts across major companies, especially in tech. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google led the way. This wave of layoffs was driven by rapid AI adoption and automation. Companies realized pandemic hiring had made them inefficient. The United States alone saw over 1.1 million layoffs, the highest since 2020. This marks a significant industry reset.

Title: For platforms, here’s what’s not going to happen in 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-01T05:01:00Z

TikTok existing in the U.S. beyond the realms of a legal ban, Meta winning its antitrust trial, and Omnicom partnering with X were not quite on Digiday’s bingo card for 2025. Which is to say that trying to predict, especially in the world of tech and platforms, what might actually materialize at any time, let alone next year, is nearly impossible. After all, a lot of what the industry thought might happen in 2025, just didn’t. Which is why Digiday has taken a slightly different approach to 2026. Instead of predicting what might happen, here is what Digiday believes won’t actually happen in next year. However long it takes (12 months and counting), the U.S. deal with China over TikTok cannot live in limbo forever. But in the meantime, marketers are simply getting used to living with its uncertainty. As Brainlabs’ managing director of paid social, Michelle Wiltz put it, the political theater around TikTok isn’t designed for resolution but for leverage. Both governments benefit from keeping the ambiguity alive. “2026 won’t deliver a clean answer about TikTok’s U.S. ownership,” she said. “Instead, it will reinforce a new operating reality: geopolitical ambiguity is a feature, not a bug and smart marketers plan for resilience, not resolution.” Nothing has come close to what Twitter was in terms of TK. Even as X, its real-time factor is its USP — something no platform has been able to replicate. And while ads are already being tested on Threads, it’s still a long way off from getting the type of attention that warrants it becoming a viable advertising track in its own right, rather than a nice add-on placement in Meta’s Advantage+. As Collective Measures’ group director of performance media, Lauren Beerling noted, Twitter wasn’t just a text-based feed, it was heavily driven by journalists, politicians, breaking news, and cultural urgency. “Threads is intentionally avoiding that energy, meaning it won’t inherit the same commercial value,” she said. “Meta seems far more focused on making Threads a ‘pleasant conversation app’ than a real-time newswire. That will attract users, but not the intent or immediacy that generates big ad revenue.” This year was probably one of Snap’s strongest years yet. By the end of Q3, the company had made $1.51 billion in quarterly revenue. But when compared to that of its peers: Meta, YouTube, TikTok — it’s still a drop in the ocean. Basis Technologies’ client strategy and insights partner, Colleen Fielder made the point that eMarketer estimated Snap will only claim 2.1% of social ad spend in 2025. “Snap’s alternative revenue paths feel limited — the Bitmoji subscription is fairly surface-level and while there’s a lot of buzz around a Perplexity partnership, it’s far too early to treat that as a major revenue engine,” she said. Plus Australia’s ban on users under 16 and an ongoing lawsuit with the city of New York — both complicate growth and advertiser confidence. A dramatic profitability jump next year seems unlikely.” Throughout 2025, there’s been an underlying narrative: AI equals efficiency, so headcount should decrease. Except the latest industry layoffs proved that they weren’t necessarily designed to cut costs on headcount, but to open up additional revenue for AI spending. “Companies will continue to use AI to reduce labor costs — especially at the top, where efficiency narratives sell well to boards and CFOs,” said Brainlabs’ managing partner of retail, Dan Connor. “What will slow is the belief that high spending itself equals progress. Companies will stop equating massive AI budgets with innovation; 2026 is the shift from exuberance to efficiency.” Everything we’ve seen so far points to one thing only: it’s no longer IF OpenAI builds an ad business, it’s when. That’s been indirectly confirmed by CEO Sam Altman himself, head of applications Fidji Simo, the latest hires of chief revenue officer Denise Dresser and Christina MacDonald — lead counsel for ads in ChatGPT. Platforms don’t make moves without intention. “Even with the recent ‘Code Red’ which caused OpenAI to pause the ads rollout to focus on product quality, the groundwork is clearly being laid,” said Robert Kurtz, strategic business outcomes partner at Basis Technologies. “2026 feels like the year they start testing ads in earnest.” Back in April, Judge Brinkema sided with the DOJ that Google held illegal monopolies. By September, the closing stage of Google’s ad tech antitrust trial saw the DOJ target the platform’s ad tech stack — AdX. While it’s not asking for a total divestiture, pulling the exchange apart would weaken its ad server. Google’s remedies argued that the DOJ’s proposals are excessive, and offered alternative solutions — it simply wouldn’t take the result lying down. Still, that’s not to say the judge will agree, and the ultimate outcome isn’t expected until next year. Retail media exploded in 2025, creating a more complex environment for everyone. And it looks set to continue next year. “I expect continued fragmentation in 2026 with a few players growing faster, but not true consolidation yet,” said Haley Feazell, vp of global media at Mindgruve. “Real shakeouts are likely later, once growth slows, and operating costs rise — similar to the timeline we’ve seen with CTV, is my expectation.” Similarly, Basis Technologies’ evp, integrated client solutions, Amy Rumpler added that consolidation certainly won’t occur in some of the larger networks that have more advanced capabilities, and ad revenues, already realized (think CVS and Kroger). “The benefits to them owning and operating their own independent networks, where they profit off of O&O inventory and audience data, is too far along to entertain consolidation with another entity,” she said. “Unless the deal was massive (like Amazon buys all of Kroger and consolidates it with their Whole Foods brands), I don’t see it happening.” Potential investors spent 2025 at least considering the idea of buying Perplexity. Apple execs reportedly held internal talks about acquiring the AI company, as did Meta — though the latter decided to invest in ScaleAI instead. Still, what it does mean is Perplexity has spent much of the year in the shop window, while its attempts to scale its ad business barely got off the ground. But by partnering with major companies throughout 2025, such as Snap, PayPal, Pitchbook and Getty, improving its publisher monetization efforts, and releasing its browser, Comet, Perplexity has strengthened its product reach and increased revenue flow, which ultimately make Perplexity more attractive to investors or acquirers considering making an offer — and likely will next year. No one can deny that Amazon is a competitor to The Trade Desk, but it still isn’t a rival. And that’s because The Trade Desk is the DSP to the open web. It’s big enough that it hasn’t had to lower fees, and has focused on being a good partner to its agency clients. And while Amazon will continue to try and claw away at advertisers’ TTD budget (we’ve already seen from reports of Amazon offering like-for-like tests, funded by Amazon) as part of its wider aim for its DSP to become the backbone for the open web. YouTube showed its renewed confidence in live streaming with its latest product updates during its Made on YouTube event this year. And with the worries about AI overtaking creators and content, live actually bypasses those concerns. “Live is the most human format we have: messy, unedited, impossible for AI to fake convincingly (at least for now),” said Natalie Silverstein, chief innovation officer at Collectively. But more importantly, YouTube, for the most part, introduces features and tools with a long-term goal in mind. “I think it will work because everything they touch turns to gold,” said Shamsul Chowdhury, former Jellyfish exec and social media expert. “Live video has that rawness to it, almost like that added authenticity. And if they can have some brand safety measures, advertisers will play.” TikTok’s ownership drama has echoes of X (formerly Twitter), but ad performance has kept marketers for fleeing—for now. AI is altering agency business models. It’s altering the skills they’re hiring for and where they’re hiring them from, too.

Title: Saks Getting Ready for Bankruptcy After Missing Debt Payment

Saks Global is preparing shortly to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its Neiman Marcus acquisition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal noted that the high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue did not make an interest payment of over $100 million on its bonds and is talking to creditors to secure financing for the bankruptcy process. Rising inflation and a weakening labor market have slowed discretionary spending for many consumers, including on luxury items. Saks Global has had many rounds of layoffs this year. The company aims to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to reduce its debt, a Saks Global spokesperson said in September to Reuters. It also aimed to raise cash through the sale of a Beverly Hills property. In August, the company restructured debt, which included $600 million in new money, and exchanged $2.2 billion in senior secured notes. The combination of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and other luxury retail and real estate companies aims to make it easier to compete with other department stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. The deal was funded by new investors, including Amazon, Authentic Brands Group, Salesforce, and others, with $2.2 billion in senior secured notes as well as an asset-based credit facility.

Title: US jobless claims slow in last full week of 2025 amid weak labour market

November saw highest unemployment since 2021, largely attributed to federal worker reductions under Trump. Share Save Over the past week, the number of United States residents applying for unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest point in a month, according to new Labor Department statistics. The weekly data released on Wednesday came at the end of a year marked by a weak labour market, a phenomenon analysts partly blame on hiring hesitancy caused by US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Experts also warn that last week’s data may also be distorted by year-end holidays like Christmas: With the shorter work week, there was less opportunity to file unemployment claims. Wednesday’s numbers mark the final full week of unemployment data for 2025. Jobless claims for the week ending on December 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000. That was an improvement from the previous week, when the Labor Department recorded 215,000 jobless claims. Its report also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,750. The US unemployment rate reached a peak of 4.6 percent in November, the highest percentage since 2021, when the country was grappling with the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase has largely been attributed to many federal employees leaving the workforce in the wake of Trump’s widespread cuts to government staffing. Jobless claims are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and offer a real-time indicator of the health of the country’s job market. Recent US government data has revealed a labour market in which hiring has lost momentum, even as other economic indicators, including the gross domestic product (GDP), have remained strong. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average of 35,000 a month, compared with 71,000 during the 12 months prior. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank reduced its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, out of concern that the job market is weaker than it appears. The move was the Fed’s third straight rate cut, with Powell saying recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. Recent data showed the US lost 105,000 jobs in October, largely due to departing federal workers, but the US economy gained back 64,000 jobs in November. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include the shipping giant UPS, automaker General Motors, online retailer Amazon and the telecommunications firm Verizon. Follow Al Jazeera English:

The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jobless claims dipped last week as layoffs remained low, despite a softening labor market. While applications fell to 199,000, analysts expected more. Recent job gains were modest, with the unemployment rate climbing. This data suggests hiring momentum has slowed, prompting the Fed to trim interest rates amid concerns about job market weakness. 2025 throwback: Op Sindoor to Shubhanshu Shukla's space mission Rajnath Singh, UP CM hoist flag at Ram Janmbhoomi Temple Sarma urges Hindus to have more children Gig workers to go on strike on Dec 31 Trains collide inside Chamoli tunnel CRPF distributes radios in Naxal-hit Bastar WB: Shah predicts 2/3rd majority BMC polls: Nomination deadline ends Assam police arrest 11 linked to IMK module We will drive out infiltrators: Amit Shah Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Searched Companies Top Calculators Top Definitions Top Slideshow Top Prime Articles Private Companies Top Commodities Top Story Listing Latest News Follow us on: Find this comment offensive?

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week’s 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year’s Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said.

Title: Is the US economy strong heading into 2026? The picture is complicated

The world’s largest economy is growing faster than its peers, but the divide between wealthy and poorer Americans is growing. Share Save As the United States economy heads into 2026, the report card emerging on its performance is complicated. By many measures, the world’s largest economy appears to be in a strong position. After a tumultuous year marked by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his swing towards tariffs and protectionism, recent growth has outpaced the expectations of most analysts. In a speech this month, Trump hailed his economic record, insisting that the US was on the cusp of an economic boom the “likes of which the world has never seen”. Yet nestled within the economic data are signs of weakness that hint at risks down the track. And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition. Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close: After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent. That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries. During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis. Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period. While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025. That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy. While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped. Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity. “We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera. “This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.” While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high. Yet Americans are continuing to spend. Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024. The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year. The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means. The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10. “Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said. Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure. “The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera. After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note. The benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent. While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households. Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup. Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September. While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable. Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs. Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year. “Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office. However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact. “The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said. “Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.” Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January. The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January. While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people. Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Once again on the path out of 2025 continues with what is sometimes my final reflective post to be written during the year. The Year is 2025 There is, at this point, a long tradition of such posts here at TAGN. If you are sufficiently bored, you can indulge yourself with the musings of past years: Usually I do highs and lows. Once in a while I try highs, lows, and in between. Those are rare years. And then there are years where the lows will grind you down if you spend too much time dwelling on them, so I just have to zero in on the good things. 2024 was like that, and 2025 even more so. For years like those I have to just leave behind all the layoffs, cancellations, studio closures, corporate greed, transparent bonus chasing, lies, betrayals, and any AI related stupidity… which is 99% of the pro-AI discourse… and focus on what went right. Or at least I have to try. I cannot be held responsible for any backhanded compliments or sarcasm you may perceive. I am only human, and can only play along with so much greed and stupidity before I start using “fuck” as a modifier in every other sentence. So here we go. CCP Enad Global 7 Other MMO and Online Game Things Other Video Game Items Blogs, Social Media, Media, and Online Life That is what springs to mind in my stream of consciousness. What else good happened? 2026 It is coming. We cannot stop it. We will have to see what it brings and what we can make from that. Thanks for reminding me I really need to watch KPop Demon Hunters. I’m always late to the zeitgeist. I only just watched the first season of Arcane and I haven’t gotten to Fallout yet. I am up to speed on Stranger Things, though. Out of curiosity, other than Snoop Dogg, what’s AI about Luna? I thought it was just the same as GeForce Now only you get it bundled with Prime. Then again, I haven’t actually used it yet… LikeLike Their intro to Luna had Snoop Dogg as the inaugural entry with a promise of more AI powered titles promised, so there was an least the implication that they are going to keep pressing the “AI” button. Then again, I am starting to see some companies and pundits lauding AI in applications where it would more correctly be called “software.” So we’re getting both people predicting a perfect AI nirvana world and others trying to jump on the bandwagon by just calling all software that does any analysis of data input “AI” as opportunistic branding. LikeLike So it goes… Thanks for keeping this going. Having another average curmudgeon to sympathize with every day keeps me grounded. Good things worth mentioning… Watching Kimmel stick it to the man (and the mouse) was, at least in the end, very enjoyable. Sinners – if you haven’t seen it, see it. LikeLike I liked Sinners. My problem was that people I know who love horror could not stop saying how great it was… and it wasn’t all that. Not for me at least. But that is always a problem, when something gets built up too much based on hype. The thing with Kimmel is that it came in the context of an awful government pressuring our billionaire overlords to stifle dissent. I applaud Kimmel, but the context of the situation is still very very bad. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent, a surge in mental health concerns and thousands of jobs lost. The link between it all? Artificial intelligence, the buzzy yet controversial technology being depicted as the future or the stock market’s next bubble, depending on who you ask. Although AI has been a key technology behind the scenes for decades, the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022 pushed the tech to the frontlines. The rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini has gradually influenced online services used by millions every day, from Google search’s AI Mode to the AI chatbots built into Instagram and Amazon. In other words, AI is starting to reshape the front door to the internet. But 2025 was also the year AI expanded beyond our screens and began impacting national policy, global trade relations and the stock market. It also raised important questions about whether the tech should be trusted in our jobs, classrooms and relationships. That’s expected to continue in 2026. “In previous years, (AI) was a shiny new object… And I think this last year was a lot more serious uses of the technology,” said James Landay, co-founder and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “And I think people are waking up to actually understanding both some of the benefits and the risks.” Count President Donald Trump among AI’s biggest believers; the technology has been a cornerstone of his second term so far. For example, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, the posterchild of the AI boom, has become a fixture of Trump’s inner circle. And the president has used Nvidia’s and AMD’s AI processors as bargaining chips in the ongoing trade war with China. This year, Trump introduced an AI action plan aimed at stripping back regulation and boosting AI use in the government. He also signed multiple AI-related executive orders, including a controversial one seeking to block states from enforcing their own AI rules. The move was seen as a win for Silicon Valley, but online safety advocates fear it’ll enable tech companies to evade accountability for AI-related risks. Next year will likely see a legal fight over the order and states’ abilities to regulate AI — with some critics arguing it won’t hold up in court. The absence of broad AI guardrails has been in the national spotlight this year and not for good reason. A slew of reports and lawsuits this year have alleged that AI companions like ChatGPT and Character.AI have contributed to mental health episodes and, in some cases, suicide among teens. “Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.” That’s how ChatGPT is said to have responded when 16-year-old Adam Raine wrote that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that someone would find it and stop him before he committed suicide. Raine’s parents sued OpenAI in August alleging that the popular chatbot advised the teen on his suicide. OpenAI and Character.AI have since announced parental controls and other changes to improve teen safety, including removing the ability for teens to have back-and-forth conversations with chatbots on Character.AI’s app. Meta also plans to let parents block their children from chatting with AI characters on Instagram next year. But it’s not just teens; a growing number of reports have indicated that AI has contributed to isolation from loved ones and breaks from reality among adults, too. One man told CNN that ChatGPT convinced him he was making technological breakthroughs that turned out to be a delusion. OpenAI said it has worked with clinical mental health experts to enable ChatGPT to “better recognize and support people in moments of distress,” including by expanding access to crisis hotlines, pointing users towards professional help when needed and adding reminders to take breaks. Still, OpenAI has said it ultimately wants to “treat adult users like adults,” allowing them to personalize their chats and even discuss erotica with ChatGPT. Psychiatrist and lawyer Marlynn Wei told CNN that she expects AI chatbots “will increasingly become the first place people turn for emotional support,” further underscoring safety concerns. Young users are among the most likely to turn to AI for support, she said. “The limitations of general-purpose chatbots, including hallucinations, sycophancy, lack of confidentiality, lack of clinical judgment, and lack of reality testing, along with broader ethical and privacy concerns, will continue to create mental health risks,” she said via email. Mental health experts and safety advocates say they hope to see greater guardrails from tech companies, especially when it comes to young AI users. But they worry the fight over regulatory power between the states and the federal government will impact the implementation of such mandated safety measures. At the same time, huge investments are being poured into data centers and AI infrastructure. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, among others, have spent tens of billions in capital expenditures this year alone, and McKinsey & Company expects companies to invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure globally by 2030. That surge in spending has sparked concerns both for consumers and for Wall Street. Some Americans have watched their electricity bills climb and job prospects sink due to AI, while some companies behind the AI boom have seen their stock reach new heights. The massive investments have also fueled worries that the hype and spending in AI is growing faster than the tech’s true value. That’s prompted investors to grill executives at Meta and Microsoft about future returns on their AI infrastructure investments during earnings calls this year. It doesn’t help that a relatively small group of companies have seemingly driven the investments, trading money and technology back and forth. Christina Melas-Kyriazi, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said it’s common for new transformative technologies to be “overbuilt.” The big question heading into 2026 is whether investors are prepared for the volatility that comes with it, especially since she says a market correction is “likely at some point.” But they’ll likely have more data at their disposal to help make those decisions, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow for the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. He said more dashboards will likely emerge in 2026 to track how AI is impacting productivity and jobs. “The debate will shift from whether AI matters to how quickly its effects are diffusing, who is being left behind, and which complementary investments best turn AI capability into broad-based prosperity,” he said. This year, thousands of tech workers were left jobless as a wave of layoffs swept the industry. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, among other tech companies, made significant cuts to their staff, driven at least in part by AI. Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees in October in an effort to operate more leanly in the age of AI. Meta let 600 workers go from its AI division, following an earlier hiring spree, so that it, too, could be more nimble. Some believe AI will lead to more layoffs, while others say it’ll create fresh opportunities. But one thing is certain: More change is coming. “This was the year that we saw skill demands totally change when it comes to what is required to be able to pull off your job,” said Dan Roth, editor-in-chief of LinkedIn. “…And I think the answer for next year is it just accelerates.” CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.

White-collar layoffs at firms like McKinsey and Amazon grab headlines for their implications about artificial intelligence and tariff pressures replacing plum jobs. But there’s another canary in the economic coal mine. What PYMNTS Intelligence calls the Labor Economy® — the roughly 60 million warehouse packers, delivery drivers, home health aides, construction workers, groundskeepers, janitors, retail associates and other blue-collar workers who keep America running — is also sending up warning signals.

Δ With the holiday shopping season in full swing, nearly half of United States Labor Economy workers say they have little to no confidence they can afford to buy presents without going into debt until next summer. Only 1 in 3 who hadn’t started shopping by Dec. 10 said they planned to buy anything at all, compared to 46% of other consumers. Those data points, a supplement to PYMNTS’ latest installment of the Wage to Wallet® Index, suggest pocketbook tightening across a broad swath of America that may indicate deeper trouble ahead. PYMNTS defines Labor Economy workers as people earning under $25 an hour, or less than $50,000 per year. Comprising about one-third the total U.S. workforce, they drive 15% of consumer spending, making them a significant economic bloc. When they dial back their spending, the broader economy takes a hit, creating ripple effects at the businesses their spending supports. Even small interruptions — think missed work shifts, reduced hours or a late direct deposit — can instantly stymie these workers’ ability to pay rent, buy groceries, make debt payments and pay for childcare. PYMNTS estimates that a 0.13% increase in wages for this group in November translated into roughly $2.2 billion in additional annualized spending capacity. This scant increase hardly offsets the 0.8% loss in wages in October, equivalent to an annualized $14 billion hit to GDP. That’s what makes PYMNTS’s fresh data about their holiday spending telling. The financial strain of Labor Economy workers is an early warning signs about pressures on broader economic health that may not show up in traditional metrics for months. Nearly 6 in 10 of Labor Economy workers are relying on cash or debit cards for their holiday purchases—meaning for them that if the money’s not in the account, nothing’s getting bought. Only 15% are using credit cards with the intention to pay in full at the end of the monthly billing cycle, compared to 31% of everyone else. And 4 in 10 plan to spend less this holiday season. Just 19% expect to spend more. And for many of those who do plan to shop, the financial pain won’t end come New Year’s day. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Of these consumers, 1 in 5 expect their holiday debt to take more than six months to repay, a financial ball and chain they will drag into summer 2025. The percentage is one-third higher than for non-labor economy workers, who predominantly have steadier paychecks and better access to low-interest credit. The irony is stark: The very workers powering everyone else’s year-end shopping — packing boxes, driving delivery trucks, restocking shelves, caring for families — are the ones most likely to skip it entirely or pay for it well into next year. It all reflects what PYMNTS calls a mirror economy. Somewhat but not entirely like the K-shaped economy of high earners doing well financially and middle-income and low-income ones struggling, the mirror economy reflects a “split” reality, in which economic sentiment “mirrors” the specific structural constraints a particular group operating in. Non-Labor optimism reflects an economy defined by expanding options and credit leverage , while Labor Economy pessimism mirrors a parallel reality defined by tightening constraints and personal liquidity pressure. In other words, different groups experience different economies, not one single economy in different ways. As such, the Labor Economy sentiment index reflects an economy that is no longer moving in a single direction but instead splitting along a fault line shaped by access to credit, timing of receipt and perceived opportunity. This suggests optimism in today’s economy is shaped less by overall employment levels and more by the mechanics of monthly and sometimes daily cash flow.

Each year, our most-read stories offer a snapshot of where the programmatic industry is at this moment. This year, programmatic companies faced tough decisions about privacy, awkward acquisitions and the cookie die-off that never quite happened. Programmatic is an industry that’s long past its youthful growth spurt and immaturity. Now it’s dealing with the discomfort of regulation and attention from lawmakers. While the programmatic web faced these tough decisions, connected TV felt the warm, golden glow of programmatic transformation. CTV represents an opportunity for programmatic natives and for streamers that haven’t fully embraced how data and automation can sweeten the revenue from their subscribers. Our top 10 stories highlighted programmatic growing pains, CTV’s evolution, how closely watched The Trade Desk continues to be and more. Here they are, starting at the top: 1. Google Is Found Guilty Of Operating An Ad Tech Monopoly (!) (April) Our top story of the year should come as no surprise to our readers. What happens to Google’s sell-side ads business affects everyone in the programmatic industry. The remedies to Google’s monopoly will have particular resonance among publishers and SSPs. The guilty verdict found that Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server with its ad exchange, setting the stage for the remedies phase in the fall, when the judge decided what punishment to mete out to Google. 2. Microsoft Is Shutting Down Invest, The One-Time AppNexus DSP Business (May) Over the years, stories about AppNexus (later renamed Xandr, then Microsoft Invest) always ranked among the most popular AdExchanger stories – both because of its independent stance as a foil to Google and its attention-grabbing moves as a company. So it makes sense that the AppNexus DSP did not go quietly into the night. Industry leaders paid attention to what this shutdown means for the broader DSP and SSP space as well as Microsoft’s strategy. 3. The Trade Desk Is Acquiring Advertising Metadata Startup Sincera (January) The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk …. made an acquisition. TTD reversed its historically un-acquisitive approach this year and bought Sincera, known for gathering advertising metadata to stamp out fraud and help advertisers improve their decision-making. In the months since, Sincera’s co-founder Mike O’Sullivan has become a public-facing decision-maker and representative for the DSP, and Sincera’s tech has woven itself into the Trade Desk’s seller strategy. 4. The Record CCPA Fine Against Healthline Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Publishers (July) The specter of CCPA enforcement has loomed over the programmatic industry for years. And Healthline’s fine, the first one to hit a publisher, offered a concrete example of what media companies have to worry about it. Tracking pixels and cookies on the health publisher’s site, a common addition to publishers’ sites, could telegraph a person’s health status. For publishers that have long gathered behavioral data about users based on the type of articles they read, this fine signaled the types of behaviors being tracked – as well as tracking, period – are no longer in compliance with the law. 5, The Trade Desk Promises Big Changes After Missing Its Q4 Guidance (February) The Trade Desk has long been a darling of Wall Street. But when it missed its Q4 guidance at the beginning of this year, investors started to worry not just about The Trade Desk but publicly traded ad tech companies. The earnings miss kicked off a year of change and challenges at The Trade Desk, as it sought to get back on track and push the industry on issues like transparency and labeling resellers. Even so, it ended the year with layoffs. 6. As CTV Blooms, It’s Knives Out For The Trade Desk’s Take Rate (April) The Trade Desk also faced more competition this year. Amazon’s DSP is breaking out beyond its endemic commerce advertisers. And like Google and YouTube, Amazon is paired up with Prime Video, the AVOD-by-default platform brimming with scale and inventory. But that’s not the only CTV DSP in the mix. With a rundown on the competitive landscape of CTV DSPs, this story underlined the challenge of bringing programmatic tech to CTV. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. 7. Meet The Netflix Ads Suite, Introduced By Ads VP Nicolle Pangis (March) After years of rumors, Netflix finally added an ad-supported subscription option. And the CTV industry wanted to know more. When Ads VP Nicolle Pangis appeared at CTV Connect this year, she revealed details about Netflix’s product road map and the product acronym, NAS, that will house the streamer’s ad tech ambitions. 8. Lawmakers Demand Answers From Ad Tech Vendors Allegedly Monetizing CSAM (February) The lack of transparency in ad tech has long meant advertisers buy ads in places where they don’t want them. But putting ads in illegal places, such as on CSAM, moves the conversation of “brand safety” into a different realm. When Adalytics discovered ads placed on illegal content earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to multiple ad tech companies demanding answers. 9. Google Isn’t Launching A User Choice Prompt For Third-Party Cookies In Chrome (April) For years, Google Chrome plotted a replacement to third-party cookies. Then it walked back that decision, validating the long-held industry skepticism around Google actually going through with that plan. Instead, Chrome was going to build its version of Apple ATT, the user choice prompt that asked users if they really, truly wanted cookies. Just kidding. Google wasn’t going to do that, either – a new story that was both a bombshell and the latest industry I-told-you-so. 10. The Ad Context Protocol Aims To Make Sense Of Agentic Ad Demand (October) How will ad tech change once agents enter the scene? It’s possible agents will negotiate campaign deals on behalf of clients. And AdCP, or Ad Context Protocol, is a new protocol that will standardize those interactions. The steady hum of traffic to this article post-publication speaks to the many minds figuring out the future of AI in digital ad transactions.

Title: New BioShock 4 leak details Casino location, ‘Flushers’ enemies amid troubled development rumors

BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.

Title: Entertainment and Media Layoffs Up 18% With Over 17,000 Jobs Slashed in 2025

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A wave of consolidation, AI-driven change and cost-cutting pushed entertainment and media layoffs sharply higher in 2025 After a slight dip in layoffs in 2024, the entertainment and media industry jobs suffered through another difficult year. In 2025, over 17,000 jobs were cut across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming in the first 11 months of the year. This figure was up 18% from last year, continuing a trend from the past few years as the industry has wrestled with consolidation and other pressures like the double strikes in 2023. News alone, including broadcast, digital and print, suffered 2,254 job cuts to date, 179 of which occurred in November, but for the year, cuts were down 50% from the 4,537 job losses announced during the same period last year. The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation, according to Challenger. This summer the FCC officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, leading to layoffs across the Paramount entertainment business. Disney laid off hundreds this year, as part of CEO Bob Iger’s 2023 initiative to cut costs amid an audience migration away from cable TV subscriptions to streaming platforms. A World Economic Forum survey also found that 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI’s ability to handle more more complicated tasks have led to companies cutting jobs, although the actual return on investment of AI tools has been disappointing. Correspondingly, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. As AI cements itself into everyday life, digital media companies struggle. Sites that relied heavily on SEO and search are having to adapt strategy, leading some to shutter, like Teen Vogue. Layoffs across Condé Nast and Penske-owned properties removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations as a result. And PBS lost federal funding under President Donald Trump, forcing it to cut 15% of its staff. These job losses underscore a more broadly weaker job market, with November seeing more than 71,000 layoffs overall, the second highest over the last five years, behind only the 2022 cuts, according to said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also noted that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from year-end layoff announcements. From 2010 to 2017, the media industry lost 7,305 jobs per year on average, according to Challenger’s data. Since 2018, the average number of annual job cuts has jumped to 14,298. There is one industry in the entertainment business that is growing, though: the creator economy. As other industries shrink, the digital creator industry has only grown in 2025. From 2022 to 2024, L.A. employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, employment in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. The microdramas business has also grown this year, employing Hollywood production crews, nonunion actors and writers to create bite-sized, bingeable episodes that turn a profit. In just four years since the launch of these vertical dramas, the genre’s market has surpassed $8 billion globally, according to Media Partners Asia. Below is a look back at a grisly year that is increasingly becoming the norm for the news and entertainment industries. The entertainment industry suffered thousands of job losses this year as industry consolidation and contraction hit companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. The FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger in July, placing the company under CEO David Ellison’s hands. During the last quarter of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reviewed bids to sell its holdings. It accepted Netflix’s offer, but Paramount has continued to put pressure on the company to accepts its bid. However the bidding war plays out, any deal will result in layoffs, although the timing could stretch into 2027. As Hollywood continues to lose out on productions to the U.K. due to incentives overseas and the rising cost of shooting in Los Angeles, the industry has also taken a hit. Some of the major job cuts to hit Hollywood this year included: Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal are each planning to spinoff their cable linear assets next year. With Comcast’s creation of Versant, NBCU laid off 7% of the workforce at NBC News and more employees from the television sector of the business, with Versant trading at the beginning of 2026. Under the leadership of Gunnar Wiedenfels, Warner Bros. will house its traditional TV networks under the independent “Global Networks” company. This split will go into effect later in 2026 under the accepted Netflix bid. Paramount is still pursuing the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, and said it expects to wring out $6 billion in merger-cost savings over the next three years. Analysts predicted at least 6,000 job losses, echoing Disney’s 2019 Fox acquisition downsizing. On-location production in the greater Los Angeles area, meanwhile, declined 13.2% from July through September compared to the same period last year, according to FilmLA. Only 157 theatrical films, television shows and movies, and streaming projects shot in Los Angeles County were completed and released in 2024. That’s down 14% from the 183 projects recorded in 2023 and the 228 recorded in 2022 amidst the production backlog caused by COVID. While Hollywood remains the leader in global film and TV production, the gap continues to steadily narrow while an estimated 41,000 entertainment jobs in Los Angeles have been lost over the past five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past,” FilmLA Vice President of Communications Philip Sokoloski said. “Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.” With the impending threat and continued implementation of AI in the newsroom, media companies have made tough decisions to best fit their financial needs and maintain relevancy. Several news organizations took hits as they pivot to keep up with audiences shortening attention spans and growing content sources. The cuts came amid a broader wave of layoffs throughout 2025. CBS News laid off about 100 people in October, weeks after NBC News laid off roughly 150 people. Condé Nast also cut multiple staffers last month through layoffs at Teen Vogue and the firings of four staffers who protested the cuts. Penske staffers suffered a wave of cuts at Variety, Rolling Stone and Billboard just weeks before the holidays. The layoffs at PMC organizations also come after the company removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations in October for those who would not comply. There was a distinct rise in AI-driven layoffs this year, with the technology accounting for nearly 55,000 job cuts, according to data from Challenger. Since its introduction, AI has offered to replace workers and perform the jobs of many at a lower cost, vastly changing how employers value their employees and how secure workers feel in their roles. Amazon laid off 14,000 employees in October. CEO Andy Jassy claimed the cuts were not necessarily driven by financial or AI factors though the company’s initial memo to staffers said the company needed to meet “this generation of AI.” Microsoft similarly cut 15,000 jobs throughout the year, providing a variety of explanations for the cuts. Both companies have invested heavily in AI tools. AI’s integration into the newsroom has not been seamless for all — see the Washington Post’s AI-generated news podcast — but media organizations are leaning into the technology as a tool to keep up and compete. New York became the first state to require employers to disclose when AI is the reason for layoffs this year as more companies seek the technology out as a way to increase work efficiency and potentially cut entry level roles. “Currently, AI aids news workers rather than replaces them, but there are no guarantees this will remain the case,” a report from Columbia University’s journalism school said earlier this year. “AI is sufficiently mature to enable the replacement of at least some journalism jobs, either directly or because fewer workers are needed.”

Title: Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/12/streaming-report-card-2025-1236651338/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:30:00Z

By Dade Hayes, Katie Campione After more than five years of gushing red ink, 2025 was the year when streaming across the board started to turn a profit. There are caveats attached to that statement, of course. NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone. With that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late. In 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.” Watch on Deadline Streaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched its own flagship, Fox One. While profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation. Below, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces. 2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too, via a distribution deal with Warner Bros. 2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device. Challenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are reported as part of Apple’s overall services business, lumping them in with music, cloud storage and other operations, but the streamer clearly seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues. Biggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works? 2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well. 2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney. Challenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution. Biggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026? 2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that uphill climb has gained a big tailwind with the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence. 2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While senior execs gamely tried to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster. Challenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook. Biggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon. 2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix. 2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure. Challenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming. Biggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output. 2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing. 2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops. Challenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential. Biggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it? 2025 Highlight: Love Island USA. Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced. 2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line – aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad. (NBCU execs said at a press briefing this month that the spots will not interrupt the live action but will look to draft off them when a break comes.) Challenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives. Biggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it. 2025 Highlight: The twin home runs of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double-digit growth. 2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment. Challenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099. Biggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.

Comment Name Email Website Δ There are too many major streamers now, okay. Peacock needs to go away, Comcast has failed. When HBO Max merges with either Netflix or Paramount+, that will leave an array of streamers that can survive just fine. If Apple wanted to be in the big leagues, they would need to produce the kind of schlock Netflix does. Bottom feeding “documentaries” about serial killers, frothy romcom fantasy, teen angst, supernatural horror. Prestige drama about rich white people behaving badly and head-scratching sci fi will only get you so far. I hope Apple doesn’t start slumming. We have enough of that. If no longer reporting subscriber numbers, Streamers still have to report the specific income from the service itself, no? Could you not do the math to at least estimate how many subscribers they are getting from that? For Paramount, is Star Trek no longer a factor? South Park is mentioned over this? I know that there has been some criticism of Star Trek shows, but it can’t be that bad. Are people that stupid they can’t keep up with streamer rebranding? Do they really care? It’s like saying people are confused by the difference between an apple you eat and the company that makes phones. Speaking of Apple, how many are getting Apple streaming for free by buying an Apple product? Do they offer free subscriptions when doing so? Here is a possibly odd question: What, if anything, does it cost a streamer to run and maintain the servers providing subscribers their content 24/7? We are now hearing about AI data centers resulting in consumers paying higher electric bills. Are not streaming “data centers” somewhat the same even if not as energy hungry? Is raising subscription prices partly due to running these centers? Is canceling, or even removing, content few, if anyone, is watching, a way to save money by recycling wasted space? Has anyone thought of this? You’d have to also estimate ARPU, which varies throughout the world. For Netflix, ARPU in Asia is about half that of North America. So if Netflix adds a lot of Asian subscribers but doesn’t report subscriber figures, regional breakdown or regional ARPU, then guestimating their figures becomes dicey. And then add in the ad-based tiers, which on the surface is less revenue but actually more when you add in the ad revenue. Ad tiers are generally more lucrative than ad-free ones, which is why the streamers push them. The kind of servers Netflix has, just to serve up video, are much less power intensive than AI servers. Platforms remove content in order not to pay licensing fees on that content. The server space is a small consideration. However, Disney’s move into user generated AI content suggests that AI type servers will become far more of a factor in the future. I expect user generated content to make inroads into all the platforms, except for Apple, because prestige content without big franchises doesn’t mesh with AI nearly as well as the opposite. Star Trek has been terrrrrrible under Paramount’s watch. Strange New Worlds is all right, mainly due to good casting, but becoming stale. Nepo needs to clean house and start over with a new team. In my dreams, he hires Tony Gilroy… Apple is very generous with the free subscriptions. This year I suddenly got three free months for having a Roku TV, which was not new either so I was confused but happy to take the freebie. Streamers raise prices to whatever the market will bear. They will stop only when it causes churn in excess of the benefit of the price hike. This is true of every other business too. Prices are not set by the cost of goods. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $99 to make, the price is $100. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $1 to make, the price is $100. These streamers might be able to keep viewers attention if they didn’t wait so long between seasons. For example stranger things now has full blown adults on the show when they started out as kids. My attention span moves on if I can’t go back to a show within a reasonable time span without having to refresh my memory. The biggest elephant in the room. Short attention spans, social media and YouTube…. Yup. When everything finally shakes out I dont expect to see more than three to five streamers left standing. Ultimately Peacock can’t survive on its own, and it’s possible Paramount can’t either. Perhaps something happens between those two after Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros. Or perhaps Apple, cautiously biding its time, steps in to acquire whatever legacy leftovers remain. netflix and hulu have always been profitable, though hulu’s margins have been declining since even before disney bought it. none of the other platforms are or have ever been profitable.

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton predicts 2026 will see the technology get even better and gain the ability to ‘replace many other jobs’

Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI. “I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton replied. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.” He added that AI’s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before. That means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month’s worth of labor. “And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI.” Earlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology’s dangers. “I’m probably more worried,” he answered. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.” If an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained. To be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he’s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives. “But along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don’t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,” he warned. Some AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there’s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing. “They may think there’s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we’re not going to not do that good,” he said. “For driverless cars, they will kill people, but they’ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.” Hinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work. In October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he told Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week. While some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level. A recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI. And in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system. “It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,” he told the Financial Times

Title: Several factors affecting success for job hunters in Lehigh Valley

Time Published: 2025-12-28T12:07:28Z

Sherri Skok wants to work full time. But she is having trouble finding a company that wants her. The 61-year-old Easton resident has a resume with plenty of experience as a personal assistant/chief of staff in corporate offices, including two decades at Barnes & Noble. Apparently, it’s not enough — or it may be too much — for a long list of Lehigh Valley businesses that have advertised openings. Skok has kept a list of them; places where she’s interviewed and was subsequently rejected. Some of them couldn’t be bothered even to send a reply after they talked, which is referred to as “ghosting.” Many others simply didn’t reply to the application, which these days are mostly filled out online. Skok, who has found part-time employment since talking to The Morning Call in early November, said she probably filled out more than a thousand applications, including about 50 since moving to the Lehigh Valley this year. She says she’s received at least one interview for about a quarter of them. “I apply for jobs, and maybe I’m not 100% qualified for or even interested in, just to see where it might lead,” said Skok, who grew up in Macungie and graduated from Emmaus High School and Penn State. “I’ve been aggressive about it. I sometimes spend eight hours a day doing it. I think there has to be an angle [on a job] I’m not considering or maybe I should go about it this way, or let me reach out. There are many, many ways. But it didn’t yield anything.” Her story isn’t unique. Social media has plenty of anecdotes from hard-luck job candidates who have applied to hundreds of them without a bite. Some economists have referred to it as a “jobless boom,” a period of economic growth and high corporate profits that coincides with weak job creation and even layoffs. Michael Rivera, assistant professor of business information systems at Lehigh University, confirmed that Skok has plenty of company. “I think it’s somewhat universal,” he said. Uncertainty about the economy and politics have made some employers reluctant to add workers. “I have spoken to many companies that have funds [to hire, but] that are just hesitant,” Rivera said. “They’re not quite sure where things are going to net out, and it has impacted where they’re looking to make investments.” Additional headwinds for people on the job search are a wave of recent layoffs nationwide with 150,000 workers losing their jobs in October, according to the Associated Press. The cuts are coming from business giants such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Target and UPS that are not only dealing with uncertainty over tariffs, but are also looking at ways to implement artificial intelligence in their operations. “We’re reading about strong layoffs proposed for companies that are happening,” Rivera said. “Most recently, I read an article on Walmart’s CEO that says get ready, every single job is going to change and it’s going to have AI in it. Walmart’s plan is for more revenue without increasing its workforce.” The federal government didn’t release labor statistics during the shutdown, but payroll processor ADP reported private sector companies shed 32,000 jobs in November. According to Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, the region’s unemployment rate was at 4.9%, as of September — the most recent statistics available — with job postings up over the year by 18.9% at 15,700. Nationally, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate fell to 3.2% in October, matching the lowest figure since March 2013, not counting the pandemic. After several years at Barnes & Noble — where Skok said she earned “six figures” — she was terminated in 2019 after the company was sold. “At the end of the day, loyalty doesn’t mean anything because when the company got sold, they eliminated my department just like that,” Skok said. Skok had a complicated job search process that wasn’t helped by the COVID pandemic, which put some promising roles on hold. She did find a chief of staff position with a fitness influencer, but left after questions of financial problems. After that was a year with a small equity firm, but she was let go after a major investor dropped out. To keep her finances on track, Skok sold her home in northern New Jersey “to put money in the bank” and took up residence in Easton to continue the job search. Skok said she’s applied to a “who’s who” of local companies and nonprofits since she moved back to the Lehigh Valley. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour. Two months later, the position still was not filled, highlighting her frustration with even finding a lower-wage position. Cathy Rychalsky, who recently took over as executive director at Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, said there is a lot of frustration among job seekers, many of whom never hear back about their applications. She also said some employers are overwhelmed by the number of applications because many are people who apply to jobs not within their skillset to satisfy unemployment requirements. They simply don’t have the staff to review every application and are forced to use things as AI for screening purposes. Another factor is changes in the labor market since the pandemic as employers can be pickier with the applicant pool. “The pendulum has shifted post-pandemic,” Rychalski said. “During the pandemic, people were able to write their job description and how much they wanted to get paid. Today it doesn’t look like that, and it shifted fairly quickly. It has shifted back where the employer is really driving the car.” What to do? Rivera said that even during the search, job seekers should take command of their growth and development. “That is something that is within their span of control. They can guide that,” he said. “They need to be taking an active approach. If they’re taking a passive one, they really run the risk of having other employees outgrow them.” Rivera said earning another college degree isn’t necessary, but he recommended such things as reading, watching videos and attending seminars to improve skills. Writing a resume for the future, which includes skills and competencies you want to have in three to five years, can be a guide. Old strategies, such as networking and making human connections, are still very effective. It’s OK to use AI in the job search to tailor resumes and cover letters to align them with the job description’s keywords, he said. With companies adopting AI, it’s important to show how job seekers are integrating those tools into their skillsets. “I’ve found that the No. 1 thing that companies are looking for today is adaptability,” Rivera said. “At the moment an employee is hired, they need to be growing with market and industry trends, with their corporate culture, always looking to kind of extend their abilities further and further with new tools and new approaches.” Rychalsky suggested using services such as Pennsylvania CareerLink. She said it’s helpful to talk to someone about the ups and downs of the job hunt. “Having someone who’s on the lookout for you, who is connected to the business community, who can maybe even reach out on your behalf and ask if this person did apply, could they reconsider them?” Rychalsky said. “If we don’t have a connection with that business, we might be able to make that connection. That’s what CareerLink is here to do. It’s here to help the job seekers, and is here to help the business community.” Meanwhile, Skok will continue her search for a full-time position that includes benefits. “It’s not like a one-person flight. There are many, many people in the United States who are facing this right now,” she said. “And they’re good qualified candidates. I just don’t understand how the job market became so overly competitive. I asked myself, do these jobs even exist? Is it a way to take your information? Who knows?” Morning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at ejones@mcall.com. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour.
