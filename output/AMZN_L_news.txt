Title: California lawmakers urge Trump admin to halt cuts to national labs

View towards Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) at UC Berkeley, a US national lab that conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department Energy. Sundry Photography/Getty Images Stay Connected By Edward Graham Three California Democrats are calling on the Trump administration to reverse course on budget cuts to national laboratories, warning that “American technological, economic, and military superiority will be put at risk if our national labs are not operating at full strength.” In a July 25 letter to Energy Department Secretary Chris Wright and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the lawmakers said that, “due to unlawful reprogramming and the prospect of budget cuts as proposed by this administration’s budget request, labs have already started to lay off employees.” The letter was signed by Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla, along with Rep. Zoe Lofgren. They noted that four of the nation’s 17 labs overseen by Energy are located within their home state of California. “Indeed, we believe the work of the national labs is instrumental in ensuring that the U.S. remains the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence models,” they wrote, adding that the labs provide vital support for U.S. efforts to outpace competitors like China in the development of new capabilities. “As you know, experts in the public and private sectors alike and public officials on both sides of the aisle believe there is tremendous benefit in being the first nation to establish clear global AI dominance.” President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would slash funding for Energy’s research and development programs, including to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy that oversees labs focused on energy innovation. Several specific labs — such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory — would be in line for significant cuts under the proposed budget. Politico’s E&E News reported on Friday that the director of California’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory told staff that, “as we look ahead to the federal budget for fiscal year 2026, it has become clear that staffing reductions at the lab are unavoidable.” The lawmakers wrote that some labs have also “warned Congress that they may need to start laying off thousands of scientists and technical staff in the near future.” Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., who co-chairs the Senate National Labs Caucus, similarly wrote a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday that called for him to reverse the proposed cuts in the FY26 budget. Wright previously told Congress last month that he was “very open” to reducing the budget cuts and was “keen” on restoring some funding for national labs. “We agree that the expertise and research efforts of our national labs are invaluable to advancing these critical endeavors, and we were pleased to hear that you also believe that the President’s budget request does not sufficiently account for the critical the work at our national labs,” Schiff, Padilla and Lofgren wrote. Despite the looming threat of budget cuts and workforce reductions, several of the nation’s labs have recently partnered with outside tech firms to enhance their operations. Amazon Web Services and the Idaho National Laboratory announced on Wednesday that they will collaborate to develop AI tools for nuclear energy projects. Microsoft and the Idaho National Laboratory similarly announced on July 16 that they were also partnering to bring AI and cloud-based capabilities into the nuclear permitting and licensing space. Energy also revealed on Thursday that it selected four sites to host new artificial intelligence data centers, including Idaho National Laboratory.

Title: Layoffs surge in tech: More than 100,000 jobs cut in 2025 so far

Big quote: As Frank Herbert writes in Dune, "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them." We've now entered the second half of the year, and tech-related layoffs have already skyrocketed past the 100,000 mark. The Bridge Chronicle has compiled a list of the most outstanding mass layoffs announcements from tech companies so far, with the downsizing expected to hit rock bottom by the end of 2025. So far, Intel appears to have the most aggressive job-cutting plan of the year. The US chipmaker recently announced 24,000 job cuts, with even more layoffs expected in the near future. By the end of 2025, "Chipzilla" is projected to have let go of 75,000 core employees worldwide. The company is in a precarious position, facing a continuing decline in PC CPU sales and a strategic pivot toward an AI-focused business model. AI technology is also one of the main drivers behind Microsoft's decision to significantly reduce its workforce. The Redmond-based corporation has so far laid off 15,000 employees, affecting several divisions including cloud, gaming, and hardware. In a recently disclosed company memo, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella attempted to address the "painful" job reductions using convoluted corporate lingo that sounded like it came straight from a heartless (and brainless) chatbot. Rumors suggest Nadella is deeply obsessed with GenAI, reportedly using Copilot for both personal and professional purposes. Microsoft's attempt to justify its latest layoffs is particularly hard to defend, given the company's strong financial performance and lack of any money-related issues. Microsoft slammed for awful AI-generated Xbox job post, weeks after laying off 9,000 workers Other major tech companies – including Meta, Google, Amazon, and Cisco – have also fired or are in the process of firing thousands of employees, reallocating funds to build newer, more powerful AI models and capitalize on the agentic AI hype before it potentially collapses under its own weight. Massive funding efforts to commercialize AI aren't the only factors behind the ongoing layoffs. Big Tech went on a hiring spree during the pandemic a few years ago, betting on a remote work boom and surging demand for tech products – trends that never fully materialized. Much of that bloated workforce is now being trimmed. Additionally, a surge in geopolitical tensions and the persisting uncertainty around Trump-era tariffs are threatening future revenue prospects and prompting further cost-cutting measures. Tech layoffs show AI's impact extends beyond entry-level roles In Japanese corporate culture, CEOs are expected to take significant pay cuts to avoid layoffs. Former Nintendo President and CEO Satoru Iwata famously stated that firing employees sacrifices long-term morale for short-term gains. I'm willing to bet my bank's account that no single CEO in the Western tech business would even consider doing something like that.

Title: How A Podcast "Created Lot Of Problems" For Diamond Comics Bankruptcy

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: dennis barger, diamond The Diamond Comic Distributors' Chapter 11 bankruptcy court transcripts reveal the how a podcast "created a lot of problems" Transcripts of previous court sessions in the Diamond Comic Distributors Chapter 11 bankruptcy case have been unsealed. And, amongst other things, concern the appearance of Alliance Entertainment (or AENT) CEO Bruce Ogilvie on the Industry Of Comics comic book retailer podcast withBryan McClay, Dennis Barger and Jesse James. And how it may have created complications for AENT's initial auction win. When the Diamond Chapter 11 Bankruptcy auction at Raymond James offices was finalised, the winner was announced as Alliance Entertainment/AENT. Bruce Ogilvie, AENT chairman, was then invited onto the podcast after, apparently, watching my performance on it the previous week, talking about the Diamond situation. He also talked about the company, how he came independently to the Diamond auction, why he bid what he did, how the auction went, and his plans for Diamond as the winner. But then suddenly Diamond declared that the back-up bidders Universal Alliance and Pop Sparkle were the winners instead, and it descended into court reversals, lawsuits, and accusations, which are still playing out now. AENT, after being confirmed as the winner by the courts, withdrew from buying Diamond a short time later, claiming fraud, and has now launched a lawsuit for costs. On the 7th of April, Diamond Comic Distributor Inc, the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Diamond Comics were represented in court by Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, Alliance Entertainment or AENT, represented by Jason Teele, the Creditors' Committee represented by Gianfranco Finizio, and the DIP lender JPMorgan Chase, represented by Katherine Culbertson, with other creditors such as The Pokémon Company International and Bandai Namco present. Again, we returned to AENT, winning the auction and beating out Universal Distribution and Ad Populum. Only for disputes over the inclusion, or not, of $4.3 million in prepaid inventory, leading to the debtor's decision to proceed with Universal and Ad Populum as the "highest and best" bid. We know that AENT win this court battle, before rejecting their victory shortly afterwards. Bleeding Cool has previously reported on the impact this podcast made, now we have cold hard proof in terms of witnesses taking the stand, with allegations that he essentially spoke out of turn, before the details of the sale had been finalized, and caused disruption in the comic book community. Robert Gorin of the Debtors took to the stand and talked about his reaction to seeing Bruce Ogilvie talk about his win, publicly. "So the day after the auction ends, that very next day, chairman of Alliance goes on a video on YouTube for a transaction that's not yet papered and starts talking about plans of what's going to happen. That created a lot of problems — as an operator, that created a lot of issues based on the messages that were interpreted, that were heard, that were said on that call. One was a conversation about consolidating warehouses. So the current organisation has five warehouses, and there was a conversation with the chairman about consolidating warehouses. As you can imagine, the calls started to come in from employees: Am I out of work? Do I not have a job? I don't understand. I'm very concerned… And so now, at a time when the company is very vulnerable, we're trying desperately to keep this thing together, we're really continuing to kind of almost duct tape the aeroplane while we're flying it, if you will. Now we have a lot of noise that we got to deal with. Retailers are calling the company and saying, I've got to get my stuff within a certain period of time. I need it in 24 to 48 hours upon my order. If you're going to consolidate, how are you going to get it to me that quickly? And so it created those issues. And then vendors wanted to know, are you still doing business with me, you're consolidating, the video was unclear about our comic, are you moving forward in the comic book world and what we call floppies. And, you know, with that, the employees on the print side want to know, do I have a job? And it's a really tough conversation when you're trying to convince somebody to continue to work, to be motivated, that this is ultimately a very good thing. And they're seeing this externally, and they're saying, I don't even know if I'm going to have a job. What am I supposed to do now? Should I immediately go out and start to look for a job? And so it created a lot of distraction, heartache, and I'll call it lack of focus within the organisation." In later testimony, he broke these down a little. "First of all, we don't have an agreement papered, right? We don't even have a draft…. Second of all, there was conversation about what went on in the auction that was not necessarily public information that I don't know needed to be shared. The chairman started to give opinions of what he thought was going to happen, even saying, "I'm not very familiar with comics, that's not something I'm well-versed in, I don't know the company very well, but clearly they're not doing it right because look where they are". And he began to give opinions about, for instance, the warehouses. He talked about price points and mentioned, we don't really want to deal in five-dollar price points. Most comic books are under $5 so that created an atmosphere of, well that means he's not going to do comic books. If he wants 15, $20 price points and above, he's not really interested in doing comic books, that's a fair piece of our business." It is something that did cause some consternation at the time, it's true. Gorin continued, "He talked about the collectible grading business. He said he didn't really know a lot about it. He said that they didn't visit that site… the basic message was that they had messed up the grading business somehow. The general indication was that there was a real problem there, but indicating that he hadn't spent a lot of time on it." And there was Free Comic Book Day, with Gorin revealing his own comic book history. "Your Honor, as a long-time comic book collector, it's a big day. You wait in line, you go, and you wait in line… There could be, you know, a couple hundred people in line. And it's an exciting day. And I think retailers have come to value it significantly. And that's one of the biggest questions we've received since this whole thing started: what about Free Comic Book Day? That's going to continue, right? I mean, that's one of the biggest questions we've received." And Gorin did not like what Ogilvie said about it at all. "He says that it clearly hasn't been monetized correctly, you haven't made any money on it. I believe there's a statement along the lines of "there's no free CD or free record album day" or something along the line that caused both the staff that work on Free Comic Book Day, and retailers to really become concerned that this was not part of the future, that this would not continue." Then there were the warehouses. "He used Amazon as an example and talked about how you want to have one big warehouse rather than having multiple small warehouses, and the scale and scope and benefit that gives you. Well, at the current time, we have five warehouses spread across the country. And they're spread strategically so that when an order is received, particularly on the Alliance game side, any order can be delivered to any retailer within 48 hours, 24 to 48 hours. And so the concept of now consolidating warehouses into potentially one large warehouse had the retailers concerned because now retailers closer to where the warehouse is situated have a potential advantage over other retailers." Also the Diamond staff. "It creates concern because now employees are wondering if they should stay. And that became a very loud topic within the company. Do I stay? Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. It created concern with vendors saying, well, I can't really tell what your business model's going to be going forward. Maybe it's not a good idea for me to continue selling you product, which makes it difficult to then supply product to the retailer. So it created a lot of noise and a lot of distraction at a time when we're trying to be hyper-focused, we're trying to keep this organisation running as best we can, so that the next version of the organisation can blossom. Created concern for me that perhaps, you know, other backup bidders might say you've now had loss of value, your sales could be potentially down, or you don't have the same relationships… because they're distributors, they're selling relationships. And now all of those relationships are in flux because people are not sure, they can't have a fulsome conversation with the relationships on the other side, with third parties. It was a difficult few days from an operational perspective." In cross-examination from AENT's lawyer, Gorin stated that it wasn't the podcast per se that caused all the issues but that, "some of the items that I talked about predate the auction. And when you look at all these individually, okay, things happen. But when you start to add them all up, you get a feeling… I said that in my best business judgment, adding all of those things together, the best opportunity to close was the backup." And he did admit that as a result of the podcast, he wasn't aware of any employees quitting, retailers stopping selling Diamond products, or vendors stopping doing business with Diamond, just that it created "angst in the marketplace and within the company, it created additional noise that we had to deal with above and beyond the day-to-day running of the company. And already holding everything together with the concerns that were out there, it magnified the concerns." In later testimony, Gorin said that his concern was for employees being worried about their job, and it wasn't just the podcast reach, it was, well, me. A bit. "First of all, there were articles published about that. People download the podcast, and pieces of it were being shared. There were summaries that were being shared, you know, people who were watching it and sending around salient points that they thought were critical for various employees or etcetera to understand that was being shared. So the damage was well beyond the number of people who watched the podcast." Apparently, a tree falling in a forest does make a sound, even if there are only a few hundred views of it on YouTube.

Title: ‘The Daily Show’s Future, Cable Networks’ Fate, And 6 More Questions Facing Paramount & Skydance Post-Merger
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/07/the-daily-show-cable-tv-networks-paramount-skydance-merger-1236467952/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T00:27:30Z

By Dade Hayes Business Editor After a long, complicated slog toward Thursday’s FCC approval, Paramount Global and Skydance Media will now face a number of tricky questions in becoming one company. While the $8 billion-plus transaction will need a few more days to become official, several strategic dilemmas already have been percolating. Here are the biggest questions the new leadership will have to answer: Staffers at Paramount already have been staggered by multiple rounds of layoffs, which saw 15% of U.S. employees trimmed in the final months of 2024 and another 3.5% let go last month. Those reductions, though, were in pursuit of a stated goal to achieve $500 million in cost savings. Execs at Skydance and its financial backer RedBird Capital say they have identified about $2 billion in savings once the two companies come together. That kind of slim-down is likely to affect a large swath of the 18,600 global employees Paramount had at the end of 2024. Watch on Deadline RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN & More When other bidders were jockeying with Skydance, some of them – notably Sony Pictures in partnership with private equity giant Apollo Global – were viewed as worse options in terms of job preservation. Surely, a Sony-Apollo takeover could have threatened the future of Paramount Pictures and its storied Melrose lot, and the duplication on the studio side surely would have left thousands without jobs. And yet Skydance might still end up as less of the savior it was seen as initially, depending on the extent of the cuts. As it has lost tens of millions of households due to cord-cutting in recent years, Paramount’s linear cable business has become a growing concern for investors. Media industry peers like NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery and A+E Global Media are in various stages of separating or exploring strategic options for their linear holdings. Now that the Skydance deal is done, the cable portfolio — consisting of brands like BET, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount Network — is likely to leave the fold in some fashion. Jeff Shell, CEO-in-waiting for the new entity, has been bullish on linear TV’s future thanks to demand for sports. Broadcast and streaming will serve as the two weighted ends of what Shell has called a “barbell” of revenue, separated by the skinny bar of cable networks. “For a lot of us, we thought broadcast would decline along with cable five years ago,” the exec told investors in July 2024. “That simply hasn’t happened.” RELATED: Jeff Shell Faces Scrutiny Over Past Conduct As Top Paramount Job Looms Prior to the proposed Skydance transaction, Paramount had explored selling BET (including its studio and streaming service) as well as Showtime. Former CEO Bob Bakish’s falling-out with Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, which led to his ouster in the spring of 2024, was caused in part by his rejection of a $3 billion offer for Showtime. The premium network wound up being merged with Paramount+ and lost much of its original value. Despite Shell’s optimism, Naveen Sarma, managing director at S&P Global Ratings, has warned that linear will continue to be an albatross for Paramount. “Maybe Skydance will have a strategy that addresses some of that, but over the next, call it, year or so, year and a half,” he said in December. “We’re going to see a company that’s going to go through a lot of upheaval because of the transaction.” “I’m not going anywhere, I think,” Jon Stewart said on Monday’s episode of The Daily Show after a particularly long rant about corporate capitulation to “Lord Farquaad.” However, given Paramount’s cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (“purely a financial decision,” per CBS), Daily Show staffers clearly are concerned that the Comedy Central show could be next. The show is currently on a hot streak in terms of ratings and awards nominations, and perhaps more importantly, one would imagine that if such a plan was in the works, Chris McCarthy, one of the outgoing Co-CEOs of Paramount Global, would have made a similar move to his colleague George Cheeks and done it before the deal was approved by the FCC. RELATED: ‘The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart Torches Paramount Over Colbert Axing: “Go F*ck Yourself” It’s clear that late-night is in a bad place, but one thing going for The Daily Show is that other than a handful of animated shows (South Park, Andy Samberg’s Digman! and a new season of Beavis & Butt-head), Comedy Central doesn’t have a great deal of original programming to satisfy its parent company’s carriage agreements. “Comedy Central is kind of like Muzak at this point. I think we’re the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park,” Stewart added. The merger will bring Skydance Television into the Paramount Global fold, which already includes CBS Studios, MTV Entertainment Studios — which produces all Taylor Sheridan series and Emily in Paris — and BET Studios. Some consolidation is expected. Led by David Stapf, CBS Studios, which absorbed Paramount TV Studios in 2024, has a distinct broadcast focus as the main supplier of CBS. Paramount Global co-CEO Cheeks, President of CBS, who is expected to stay put in the post-merger Paramount, is believed to be high on both Stapf and CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach, so CBS Studios is expected to carry on. RELATED: Paramount Using Taylor Sheridan, 101 Studios Relationship As Model For Success Says Co-CEO It is unclear how exactly the rest of the production units will shake out, but Skydance Television President Matt Thunell is poised for a leadership role at a combined TV banner that may carry the Paramount moniker. As for Sheridan, with Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy, who oversees MTV Entertainment Studios, set to depart, one of his top lieutenants, Keith Cox, who already works closely with the prolific creator, could become his point executive. A few key posts have been determined, with Netflix vet Cindy Holland coming in to oversee streaming and Skydance Chief Creative Officer Dana Strong in line to take over Paramount Pictures. Deadline is hearing of a couple more changes. Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group Co-President Josh Greenstein is rumored to be entering talks for a role in the new corporate hierarchy. Skydance couldn’t go into talks with Greenstein, who is a close associate of Skydance CEO David Ellison’s, until the merger was approved. Following the exit McCarthy, Nina L. Diaz, Chief Creative Officer and President of Content for Showtime/MTV Entertainment, is expected to exit also. Even more than South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who clinched a mega-deal with Paramount this week, the primary creative voice associated with Paramount Global is Sheridan. The Yellowstone creator has generated billions in value for the company, though observers both inside and out have wondered about the future of the relationship given the changing of the guard. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sheridan has been accustomed to working with large budgets, which surely will go under the microscope, as is the case anytime new owners take over. When Discovery merged with WarnerMedia in 2022, JJ Abrams’ lavish $250 million, five-year deal immediately became a topic. The parties wound up agreeing to a shorter two-year deal in 2024. Any radical change in the Sheridan universe won’t come anytime soon, given that he has several years left on his current deal. But the producer would have plenty of options for a new home down the line, given the aggressive spending by Apple, Amazon and Netflix of late. One widely anticipated change would see Paramount+ move closer together in the organization with Pluto TV, its free, ad-supported sibling. Such a move would save considerable costs in many departments. Those kinds of larger shifts aren’t primarily what Holland is being brought in to do. Plus, Pluto doesn’t have original programming. Holland, who teamed with Ted Sarandos to launch Netflix’s original programming more than a decade ago, already has been working behind the scenes to put together a slate. Her main mission will be to give Paramount+ more of an identity. While it has grown to 79 million subscribers, the “news, sports and a mountain of entertainment” marketing handle has been a frustratingly apt description of its uneven assortment of fare. RELATED: ‘NCIS: Tony & Ziva’ Takes Comic-Con, Drops New Trailer Skydance CEO Ellison, who will take the helm of the combined company, has talked about investing in the technology behind P+, which has had a start-and-stop rollout of table-stakes features like auto-play trailers. As advertisers and viewers continue to flock to streaming, though, a rebooted tech stack alone won’t get the service where it needs to be. Could they? Yes. Will they? Likely not. A clause in the 11-year rights deal CBS signed with the NFL in 2021 could be triggered with the merger, allowing the league to renegotiate given the change in control of the company. Questions had swirled about that doomsday scenario in 2024, with Commissioner Roger Goodell’s ambiguous remarks on the matter seeming to add fuel to the speculation. RELATED: NFL 2025 Schedule: List Of All The Games, Dates & Times To Watch Live Just this month, though, in an interview with CNBC at Sun Valley, ID, where he was attending the Allen & Co. conference, Goodell struck a much more upbeat tone about the status quo. “We’ve had a long relationship with CBS, for decades,” Goodell said. “We also have a relationship outside of that with Skydance. So I don’t anticipate that [opting out is] something that we’ll see. We have a two-year period to make that decision. I don’t see that happening, but we have that option.” Peter White, Anthony D’Alessandro and Nellie Andreeva contributed to this report. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The company founded by Jeff Bezos is at the heart of the technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) driving its transformation. And with this evolution comes the demand for new profiles and salary changes. According to information shared by Amazon with the U.S. government and reported by Business Insider, these are the salaries received by software engineers, data scientists, product managers, financial analysts, and artificial intelligence experts. Software engineers remain the backbone of Amazon’s technological operations, especially in key divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Data Services, and the Amazon Development Center US. The latest data shows the following base salary ranges: These figures correspond to foreign employees hired in the United States in the first quarter of 2025 and do not include variable compensation such as bonuses, stock options, or additional benefits. Data scientists play a key role in developing intelligent products, optimizing logistics processes, and personalizing user experiences. Their salaries reflect that importance: Although Amazon does not publicly list all salaries related to AI, positions such as Applied Scientist and Solutions Architect indicate the compensation levels the company offers: In addition to engineers and scientists, Amazon generously compensates professionals who lead and analyze tech projects: Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, stated clearly that AI will lead to layoffs, but also spark a wave of new hiring, especially in areas like robotics, data science, and machine learning. In a June 2025 memo, Jassy encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever possible”, which sparked controversy among workers—especially since, in some Amazon subsidiaries, AI usage is now a mandatory criterion for promotions, according to Business Insider. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon hired approximately 11,300 foreign workers. Information from Business Insider Cancela en cualquier momento Acceso exclusivo a rankings y radiografías.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Amazon to shut down Shanghai AI research lab amid US-China tensions
URL: http://technode.com/2025/07/25/amazon-to-shut-down-shanghai-ai-research-lab-amid-us-china-tensions/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T17:14:22Z

Amazon is set to dissolve its Shanghai AI Research Institute, the company’s last overseas AI lab under AWS, citing a “strategic adjustment” between China and the US, according to a social media post by Wang Minjie, an applied scientist at the lab. Amazon confirmed staff reductions to Chinese media outlet Caixin, but did not directly confirm a full closure. Established in 2018 during China’s inaugural World Artificial Intelligence Conference, the lab focused on research in graph neural networks and contributed to open-source projects like the Deep Graph Library. The institute, led by NYU Shanghai professor Zhang Zheng, remained small and never officially disclosed its headcount. The closure comes as Amazon continues global layoffs amid earnings pressure, with AWS revenue growth slowing for three consecutive quarters. The move also follows similar pullbacks by US tech giants including IBM and Citigroup, which have recently downsized their China-based R&D operations, signaling a broader trend of reduced American tech investment in China amid geopolitical tensions.

Title: Tech industry layoffs hit 100,000 for 2025 — Intel leading the pack with over 12,000 personnel cut, so far

Thousands are being laid off due to industry shifts. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The tech industry has been reeling from a series of layoffs from big tech companies, and we’re just a few weeks into the second half of the year. According to numbers compiled by The Bridge Chronicle, more than 100,000 have been laid off so far, with Intel the leader, slashing over 12,000 positions across the globe. Microsoft follows closely, with 10,000 personnel laid off from several divisions, including cloud, gaming (including game studios), and hardware. Meta has also cut about 8,000 workers despite offering $100M bonuses for new AI hires and rapidly building AI data centers. Other big companies affected by layoffs include Amazon, Google, Salesforce, and Cisco. Intel had been expected to trim off several positions ever since its disastrous financial report in August 2024. Its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, undertook a 20% workforce reduction in April, with its entire automotive chip division reportedly getting the axe in June. It has also reportedly reduced the number of fab workers at its Oregon site in the same month, and rumors point to more planned in the coming weeks. The other companies that laid off thousands of personnel are not suffering from poor financial performance, but changing priorities and technologies are forcing them to pivot. The biggest disruption so far is delivered by AI, with institutions turning towards automation to reduce their workforce. A few CEOs, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Ford’s Jim Farley, are warning that artificial intelligence will decimate America’s white collar workforce, but Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says that it all depends on humanity’s creativity. The Bridge Chronicle also says that the massive remote work hiring made by tech companies during and immediately after the Global Pandemic, in anticipation of the massive growth pushed by quarantines, is coming back to bite them. When the world eventually opened up, these expected gains did not materialize, leading to a bloated workforce, with many redundancies in tasks and positions. Aside from that, global headwinds have also dampened the outlook of several companies. President Trump’s tariffs have resulted in shockwaves across different industries, with tech companies some of the most affected by the changes. There’s also Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine, as well as the China-US trade war. While tech giants continue to invest billions in artificial intelligence and data centers, spending both on infrastructure and people, they’re also cutting back on less profitable ventures, resulting in thousands of layoffs being reported across the industry.

Business FILE PHOTO: Shoppers browse a Walmart Supercenter a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, in Secaucus, New Jersey, U.S. April 3, 2025. REUTERS/Siddharth Cavale/File Photo NEW YORK :Walmart unveiled plans on Thursday to roll out a suite of AI-powered "super agents" designed to improve the shopping experience for customers and streamline operations. The world's largest retailer said the four agents powered by agentic AI - designed for Walmart shoppers, store employees, suppliers and sellers, and software developers - would soon be the primary way people engage with Walmart. The super agents will be the entry point for every AI interaction these groups have with Walmart, replacing several existing agents and AI tools, along with new ones yet to be built, the company said. Walmart is betting on AI to drive its e-commerce growth, aiming for online sales to account for 50 per cent of its total sales within five years. The company reported annual sales of $648 billion last year. By harnessing AI to streamline the shopping process - from discovering new products and helping with returns to improving delivery speeds - the retailer hopes it can attract more shoppers away from Amazon, which has also introduced a range of AI-powered tools for sellers and shoppers.

Loading Walmart's push comes as the short-term financial payoff of AI remains uncertain and concerns over how it might affect jobs across the industry.One of the agents, Sparky, is already available for shoppers on Walmart's app as a Gen-AI powered tool. Currently it assists customers with getting product suggestions for an athletic activity, finding the right ink for their printer, or summarizing product reviews, among other options.In its "super agent" form it will be able to reorder items, plan an event such as a "unicorn-themed party" and through computer vision be able to offer product recipes by just looking at the contents of a shopper's fridge, Hari Vasudev, Walmart's U.S. chief technology officer, said at an event in New York. Agentic AI is the next iteration of generative AI, in that it needs minimal human intervention to make decisions and achieve specific tasks.Walmart is also developing an "Associate" super agent, to be rolled out in the coming months, which will allow workers and corporate staff to do things such as submit an application for parental leave or give store managers immediate information on sales data for a certain category or a product with minimal input. Employees now use separate AI tools to handle those queries, a company spokesperson said. For sellers, suppliers, and advertisers, Walmart is developing a super agent called "Marty" to streamline the onboarding process, manage orders and create ad campaigns. It is also working on a "Developer" super agent, which will be the platform on which all future AI tools will be tested, built, and launched, the company said. "Agents can help automate and simplify pretty much everything that we do," Suresh Kumar, Walmart's chief technology officer said. He added that the company chose to launch these super agents now because "customers are ready, they are using AI in pretty much everything they do."The company declined to say whether the super agents would replace jobs. Dave Glick, senior vice president of enterprise business systems, said it would create new jobs without elaborating further. On Wednesday, Walmart had two AI-related announcements: it hired former Instacart executive Daniel Danker as executive vice president (EVP) for AI acceleration, product and design and created a new EVP, AI role that is yet to be filled.While retail has largely avoided AI-related layoffs, the tech industry has been hit hard, even in a historically strong market and resilient economy. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce over the next few years. Microsoft has emphasized that AI will boost productivity, but it has laid off thousands of employees, while Google has laid off hundreds of employees. Walmart has not linked any job cuts directly to AI, but it has been downsizing its corporate staff and is modernizing e-commerce fulfillment centers with automation, resulting in some workforce reductions.

Title: As S4 struggles, Sir Martin Sorrell keeps firing shots at the industry he created

Time Published: 2025-07-24T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Connect with execs from The New York Times, TIME, Dotdash Meredith and many more Sir Martin Sorrell has never lacked for sharp opinions. That’s expected from the architect of the holdco company era. But lately, his commentary has gone from reflective to biting. In recent months, he dismissed WPP’s consolidation efforts as a “disgrace”, lobbed shade at Omnicom for what he implied would be an overpriced acquisition of IPG and blamed WPP’s current struggles on what he called “weak leadership” under CEO Mark Read. In June, he went further: WPP, he said, might be beyond saving. Needless to say, Sir Martin makes his views known. “People, including you, ask for my views,” said Sir Martin in an email to Digiday in response to a request for comment on this story. “I’ve spent almost 50 years at Saatchi & Saatchi, WPP and S4Capital — perhaps, as a continued shareholder in WPP, I have some helpful experience and views.” Helpful or not, those views come with baggage. S4 Capital, the company he built in response to the holdco model he now criticizes, has lost 97% of its market value, issued multiple profit warnings and been caught in the crosswinds of shifting ad budgets. His pointed commentary hasn’t gone unnoticed. “I only wish he was as vocal and clear minded on what needs to be done at S4,” said Anthony Freedman, CEO of marketing services group Common Interest and a shareholder of S4 Capital, on LinkedIn. Sir Martin sees no contradiction. He’s clear-eyed about S4’s challenges — but sees them as macroeconomic not structural. The plan, as he told Digiday, is to stay the course — tighten operations, ride out the volatility and focus on growth in the Americas, Middle East and APAC where clients are still chasing gains. In Europe, he’s betting on a push for greater efficiency and effectiveness. S4 Capital, he insisted, was built for moments like this — when clients demand more for less and faster. The company is focused “on top-line growth with our existing clients and new ones, improved operating margins and liquidity, focussing particularly on improved pricing, billability and reducing duplication,” he wrote. But markets don’t trade on messaging alone. In September 2021, S4 Capital’s shares peaked at $12.25. Today, they hover near 30 cents. Whether there’s an actual bounceback is unclear — but Sir Martin sees one. He points to a current blue-chip client list that includes Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, GM, T-Mobile and Walmart as well as a newly won CPG advertiser he declined to name, as proof that the model still works. As for the broader slowdown in ad dollars from tech clients? That was inevitable, he said. “With 50% of our almost $1B of revenues coming from tech there has been pressure on opex and hence marketing as the “Magnificient 7” and others spend over half a trillion dollars on AI-related capex,” wrote Sir Martin. What’s certain is this: Sir Martin’s critique of the holding company model may still resonate, but the industry feels that it hits differently when coming from someone whose own reinvention is under just as much strain. “What you have to question is, does he provide enough day-to-day leadership?,” said one source who knows Sir Martin well. But it wasn’t always like this. In its early days, S4 Capital had momentum. Launched in 2018 with Sir Martin freshly out of WPP, the company moved quickly — acquiring MediaMonks and MightyHive within months, and landing marquee clients like Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Mondelez and Bayer in its first year. “I always thought the work from them was outstanding, and a big part of that was down to the people who worked there,” said a senior marketer familiar with the group’s pitch, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They weren’t just typical ad agency people, they were from tech and consulting backgrounds.” For a time, this was the story of S4 Capital: proof that a tech-first approach could disrupt the industry. But as the years went on, the cracks began to show. Audit delays in 2022 rocked investor confidence. The following year brought revised revenue guidance — twice — along with 500 layoffs and pressure on margins. The stock cratered. By 2024, S4 Capital was still playing defense, issuing fresh profit warnings and watching its tech-heavy client base pull back on spending. In the background, a CFO change signaled yet another attempt to restore stability. “The person at the top is all about finance models and therefore doesn’t put anywhere near enough emphasis on people and the actual operating of the business,” said an exec familiar with S4’s plans, who exchanged anonymity for candor. As the issues mounted up, so did the tensions at the top. S4 Capital’s equity-heavy acquisition model, which had once helped close deals, began to backfire as the share price fell. Founders who had bought into Sir Martin’s vision started to disengage. “The model of 50% cash and 50% equity works when the share price is growing,” the same exec said. “But as soon as it starts falling, all the owners of the acquired companies become extremely disgruntled, demotivated and less productive.” Despite these issues, few in the industry are ready to count Sir Martin out. His track record, stubbornness and proximity to power still matter. But there’s a growing sense — even amongst those who admire him — that the public markets may no longer be the right arena. “In 12 months’ time, I believe S4 Capital will not exist in its current form,” said an ad exec, with knowledge of the internal issues at the business. Industry chatter suggests that delisting is one option. A merger or acquisition is another. Some believe parts of the business could be spun out through a management buyout. However it unfolds, the status quo isn’t expected to hold. Sir Martin did not comment on any of these potential routes for the company. “I don’t think any public company chairman could or should answer that,” he wrote.” At S4 Capital, I’m focussed on long-term shareowner value maximization and acting in the best interests of all shareowners.” Where S4 will end up is anyone’s guess. It certainly can’t keep headed in the same direction it’s been going. Sir Martin knows what’s wrong with holding companies, but has not yet proven he knows how to build the alternative. The thinking behind the acquisition is to round out Brainlabs’ offering to be more full-funnel, given Exverus’ abilities at the upper end of it. While S&P 500 selection criteria is nuanced, the snub of a peer with a much larger market capitalization warrants questions. There are still numerous sticking points to resolve in CTV if marketers are to feel they’re receiving value for their investment.

Title: AWS reportedly shutters AI research lab in Shanghai

UPDATED 19:12 EDT / JULY 23 2025 by Maria Deutscher Amazon Web Services Inc. has reportedly closed an artificial intelligence lab that it operated in Shanghai. The Financial Times reported the move today. The Amazon Web Services AI Shanghai Lablet, as the shuttered facility was known, opened in 2018. It’s unclear how many staffers the center employed. The researchers’ areas of focus included natural language processing and AI development tooling. AWS’ Shanghai AI lab played a key role in creating the Deep Graph Library, an open-source tool for training graph neural networks. Those are AI models optimized to process graphs. A graph is a data structure that can describe how different business records relate to one another, which is valuable for many analytics projects. A former applied scientist at the lab reportedly announced its closure in a post on WeChat, China’s most popular social network. The Financial Post cited the researcher as saying that the lab “was being dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid U.S.-China tensions.” Earlier this month, the U.S. rescinded rules that prevented Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from exporting AI chips to China. However, officials have indicated that they could increase scrutiny of such chip sales going forward. A newly released policy paper from the White House recommends that the U.S. government “pursue creative approaches to export control enforcement.” It’s also possible the closure of the AI lab is related to a recent round of layoffs at AWS. According to Reuters, the Amazon.com Inc. unit has cut “at least hundreds” of roles. It’s believed that AWS’ training and certification team was among the affected business units. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” an Amazon spokesperson told Nikkei Asia today. Other companies are also scaling back their AI work in China. The Financial Times cited sources as saying that McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm, has instructed its business unit in China to avoid taking on generative AI projects. The unit employs more than 1,000 workers. Earlier this year, AWS rival Microsoft Corp. reportedly extended relocation offers to 700-800 of its staffers in China. According to the Wall Street Journal, the employees who received the offers work on AI and cloud projects. The staffers reportedly represent about 10% of the workforce at Microsoft’s Asia Pacific research and development group, which is largely based in China. It’s believed the company earlier shuttered its IoT and AI Insider Lab in Shanghai. Microsoft operates several such facilities around the world. As of 2017, they focused on helping the company’s customers build AI-powered connected devices. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Jeff Bezos weighing possible acquisition of CNBC cable network: sources

Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has been weighing a possible acquisition of CNBC, The Post has learned. The 61-year-old e-commerce magnate has signaled interest to business associates in buying the cable network — home to “Squawk Box” and “Mad Money with Jim Cramer” — after it is spun off by NBCUniversal parent Comcast later this year, according to a person familiar with Bezos’ thinking. CNBC would “align well with his interests,” said another source close to Bezos, who noted that the network could serve as a credible “neutral voice” in his media portfolio — a major plus following Bezos’s headaches as owner of the left-leaning Washington Post. The Amazon founder has weathered months of headline-grabbing chaos at the iconic newspaper, which has been mired in losses, layoffs and staff protests over his moves to shift the paper’s coverage in a more centrist, pro-capitalist direction. A rep for Bezos declined to comment. Comcast, meanwhile, plans to spin off its struggling cable assets — which also include MSNBC, USA Network and E! — by the end of the year. CNBC will become part of a publicly-traded company called Versant, which will be run by a handful of NBCUniversal execs led by Chief Executive Mark Lazarus. Sources close to Comcast told The Post that Bezos has not approached the cable giant headed by CEO Brian Roberts. Another source close the situation said Versant plans to grow CNBC, not sell it. Versant declined to comment. It is unclear how much Bezos — currently ranked as the fourth richest person in the world with a net worth of $241 billion, according to Forbes — would be willing to pony up for CNBC. Comcast does not break out financials for its cable assets but recently said the soon-to-be spun-off Versant generated about $7 billion in revenue last year. Buying CNBC would be tricky. There is a two-year period in which Versant could not engage in selling major assets like CNBC or even the entire company without major tax implications, sources told The Post. A source close to the situation said the company won’t likely jeopardize the tax-free nature of the spinoff. Late last year, Comcast announced it would hive off its cable assets and keep NBCUniversal’s NBC broadcast TV network, “Real Housewives” home Bravo, its film and TV studios and theme parks, as well streaming service Peacock. Bezos bought the Washington Post from the family of Katharine Graham in 2013 for $250 million, but the paper since has been dogged by steep losses as subscribers have fled. The Amazon founder has been vacationing with his new bride Lauren Sanchez in the South of France. They were spotted Tuesday leaving glitzy beach club Le Club 55, not far from where the mogul’s mega-yacht, Koru, dropped anchor. Bezos’ desire to expand his media empire follows a flurry of headlines in recent weeks that he was interested in buying Vogue magazine for Sanchez, a former TV reporter — or even the fashion glossy’s parent company Condé Nast. Over the past year, Bezos and Washington Post CEO Will Lewis have tried to move the Beltway broadsheet more to the center — to the dismay of staffers. Bezos’ decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election in November sparked a revolving door of high-profile departures. More than 300,000 readers canceled their subscriptions. The uproar continued after Bezos ordered the outlet’s opinion section to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” — a more neutral topic — rather than weighing in on politics and other issues. The directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of longtime columnist Ruth Marcus. On Monday, Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion writer Jonathan Capehart announced he accepted a buyout. Advertisement

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said the deal, for an undisclosed amount, has yet to close. Amazon has confirmed that it is acquiring AI wearables company Bee. The news was first revealed via Bee’s website and a social media post from Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, is signed but hasn’t closed, an Amazon spokesperson said by email. The company sells a wristband that records, transcribes and provides feedback on conversations for about $50; a subscription service is also planned. Those plans are likely to gain steam under Amazon’s ownership. Subscriptions as sources of recurring revenue have long been a focus of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy; in its most recent quarter, the company’s subscription revenue rose 9% to $11.7 billion. In May, Jassy touted Alexa+, the agentic AI upgrade of the company’s Alexa virtual assistant, and told analysts that the company is investing in AI to further customer service innovations. All Bee employees received offers to join Amazon, though the company spokesperson declined to provide numbers. Last month, Jassy warned employees that AI was likely to lead to workforce cuts. This year Amazon announced layoffs in its North America retail and bookselling businesses.

Title: Vibe Coding Turned This Swedish AI Unicorn Into The Fastest Growing Software Startup Ever

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin, Forbes Staff. Oskar Munck af Rosenschöld never planned to be in show business. But over a fika (coffee break) in Stockholm, Sweden, a film producer friend pitched him on a startup idea: a marketplace to match films with financiers, helping European moviemakers with the neverending task of raising money. Often such ideas never escape the talking stage. But just a few months later, FrameSage was live and had booked its first $50,000 in revenue—thanks to a new AI coding tool, Lovable, that Munck af Rosenschöld used to build the company’s plumbing in just 10 days. “You feel like you have the magic key to build software,” says Munck af Rosenschöld, whose works as a project mana­ger at a pharma company by day and who had never coded before outside of school. “This has saved us tens of thousands of dollars on developers and around four months’ work.” Munck af Rosenschöld isn’t the only young founder to have fallen for Lovable, Sweden’s new AI unicorn. In June alone, around 750,000 projects—apps, websites, entire businesses—were built, hosted and launched with a handful of descriptive sentences and a few clicks on Lovable. This isn’t like the clunky website builders of yesteryear, responsible for zillions of personal sites; nor are they sketches or wireframes that might look cool but aren’t functional. Lovable projects, spun up in minutes thanks to generative AI, are actual working products with features ranging from email newsletters to payments via Stripe. “I was shown Lovable and knew what I was going to do for the coming years,” says Malmö, Sweden–based Jaleel Miles, who built his restaurant management startup, Quicktables, in just two months on Lovable. He has booked over $120,000 in sales from the site since May. Lovable has become the fastest-growing software startup in history, reaching $100 million in subscription revenue (on an annualized basis) in just eight months since its launch last November, eclipsing other rocketships like Israeli cloud security startup Wiz and San Francisco–based HR platform Deel (which hit the same benchmark in 18 months and just under two years, respectively). “Humans are builders at heart, but being able to write code, or having access to capital, has been the defining part of being able to build software,” says cofounder and CEO Anton Osika, 34, who started Lovable in September 2023. “Now we are entering a new era.” It’s not just scrappy young founders who are building on Lovable. Rio de Janeiro–based QConcursos has about 200 staff helping Brazilian students prepare for college and civil service exams. CEO Caio Moretti says he used Lovable to spin up a new premium version of its app in just two weeks. It made over $3 million in its first 48 hours. “If we were coding on our legacy platform it would have taken us a year to build a new product,” he says. Photo by Sebastian Nevols for Forbes It was a pickleball tournament tracking app that did it for Accel partner Ben Fletcher. The London-based investor built the gadget on Lovable in a weekend, then spun up a tool that helps Accel sift through startup sales data. He’s now leading a $200 million round in the Swedish startup, which values the 45-person company at $1.8 billion (its cofounders’ estimated 50% stake is jointly worth $900 million). “We see Lovable as an opinionated CTO that builds your product for you,” says Osika, who has just started writing his own small checks into Lovable’s most promising projects. That $200 million, on top of the $23 million it raised previously, should help Lovable fend off competition from well-funded Bay Area rivals like Replit (which last raised $97 million at a $1.2 billion valuation) and StackBlitz—which raised $105 million in January and is on this year’s Next Billion-Dollar Startups list. But it’s not just other upstarts Lovable needs to worry about. AI giants OpenAI and Google, whose Firebase Studio can build apps and websites from prompts in simple English, are also interested in the so-called “vibe coding” market. The same tech that’s powering Lovable and its rivals is also sweeping through Silicon Valley’s professional ranks. Startups like Cursor, Cline and Cognition’s code writing tools for pro programmers are transforming how tech is built. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella claims that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI. Google’s Sundar Pichai, who has made similar claims, reportedly just spent $2.4 billion to poach the founders of Windsurf to pump up Google’s AI code tools. Once-coveted software engineers were reportedly caught up in recent layoffs at both companies. Venture fund SignalFire, which tracks tech recruitment, saw hires for entry-level coders drop by a quarter last year. But Lovable doesn’t pretend to cater to the pros. Its fans are tinkerers, designers and entrepreneurs. “Developers are really important, but they’re only 1% of the market,” Fletcher says. For entrepreneurs like Theresa Anoje, who had never coded anything beyond tweaks to her Tumblr page, Lovable has been a game changer. For years, the San Francisco–based founder wanted to build her careers newsletter, Remotely Good, into a full-fledged job-hunting website but had hit a wall with fundraising and scaling up. Then she built a new website in just a weekend with Lovable. “It was an enormous relief,” she says. “It was a revelation.” Lovable lets anyone make a handful of simple projects for free, but more-complex features and AI code requests can be unlocked with fees star-ting at $25 per month. Building something like the classic cellphone game Snake would cost the equivalent of a buck in Lovable credits, while a more-elaborate app could run upward of $50. That’s still less than the hourly rate of even humdrum human programmers. Osika himself didn’t start out as a coder, even though he’s been programming since age 12 the same type of simple games that Lovable can now build in minutes. He studied physics at Sweden’s elite KTH Royal Institute of Technology and then joined CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, in Switzerland. He lasted only a few months; CERN had a thousands-strong army of the best physicists in the world, but Osika quickly started to think the slow grind on “impossible projects” like hunting dark matter was a waste of human potential. “The realization was that you have much, much more impact being in industry, building companies,” he says. After a stint at Stockholm-based proprietary trading firm Ampfield, Osika joined an education AI startup in 2017, then signed on as cofounder and CTO at Depict AI, helping cofounder Oliver Edholm sell an Amazon-style product recommendation algorithm to retailers. They joined startup hothouse Y Combinator and within a year generated $1 million of revenue, raising $17 million in 2022 from big-name investors like Tiger Global. But Depict’s growth fizzled along with pandemic e-commerce mania, and AI began to catch fire with the launch of ChatGPT. “I was thinking, ‘We have to do this at Depict, or I have to find a way to leverage this huge wave that is coming toward us,’ ” Osika says. He was so sure of the potential that he built an AI tool dubbed GPT Engineer in his spare time, publishing it to developer platform Github in June 2023. When the app shot to the top of Github’s trending page almost overnight, Osika knew he was on to something. So he quit, recruiting former Depict staffer Fabian Hedin to be his cofounder and CTO. The duo decided to turn his code-heavy GPT Engineer into a visual tool that anyone could use. “There was this realization that this was extremely powerful,” Hedin says. They raised an $8 million seed round led by venture fund Hummingbird in October 2023. When the first version of Lovable flopped, they rewired it to handle more than simple games or static websites. Lovable raked in more than $5 million in just over a month after the team relaunched in November 2024. Lovable is now booking around $1 million a day in subscriptions, but competition is fierce. Its focus on portfolio sites and simple prototypes puts it on a collision course with an earlier generation of unicorns like Figma and website builders such as Wix and Squarespace. All these companies are also building their own AI tools. Figma launched a code generator earlier this year, and in June, Nasdaq-listed Wix spent $80 million to buy a six-month-old AI coding startup. Lovable has limitations. It aces web design, but the plumbing of more complex apps still needs a human touch. For Dutch AI engineer Lennert Jansen, a Lovable-built prototype was enough to land a spot at Y Combinator for his startup Airweave, which helps connect apps like Gmail with autonomous bits of code called AI agents. Lovable struggled with the technical back end, so Jansen and his cofounder hand-coded it and have since rewritten the remaining Lovable code. Still, accelerating the early work meant serious time savings. “If we hadn’t had Lovable, it wouldn’t have given us this tangible starting point,” Jansen says. “It was a massive win with the speed this market moves.” Now Airweave is making $17,000 a month and just landed $6 million in funding. Another vulnerability: Like many in its cohort of vibe-coding startups, Lovable relies on the same set of underlying AI models, notably Anthropic’s Claude. Lovable is spending millions of dollars a month on these models to power its coding. Some other startups are even heavier spenders, which has put Anthropic on track to make a reported $4 billion in revenue this year. Now Anthropic, last valued at $60 billion, is selling its own code tool directly. Osika can’t do much about this competition other than to stick to building products that humans love and hop between AI models for the best and cheapest. “Humans understand humans,” he says, “and Lovable is this enabling tool to make ideas come to life in minutes.” Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images DB Apple/picture alliance/DPA/Newscom

Title: A laid-off Microsoft manager says it's not a personal failure, but he may pivot away from management
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-manager-laid-off-great-flattening-next-career-move-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-23T08:32:01Z

Patrice Melekian wanted to experience life in the US, and his job at Microsoft was his ticket. He told Business Insider he had a good, 17-year run with the company — until he got laid off from his manager job in May. He's returned to his home country of France, and while he's still figuring out his next career move, he said he might look outside management for his next role. Like many laid-off workers, Melekian doesn't know exactly why his job was cut. But he said Microsoft leaders have spoken about reducing management layers and improving efficiency — language that has coincided with manager layoffs over the past year. Melekian believes these efforts are part of a broader trend in tech. "Many companies in the tech industry, including Microsoft, have been moving to flatten their organizations to streamline the decision process," said the 54-year-old. In May, Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees in an effort to increase what it calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager, Business Insider previously reported. Then, earlier this month, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more workers. A spokesperson told BI earlier this month that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. It's not just Microsoft. Companies like Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. This trend, which some have dubbed the "Great Flattening," refGreat Flatteningpush to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. Microsoft did not respond to BI's request for comment. We want to hear from middle managers, job seekers, and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one or more of the linked Google Forms. Melekian joined Microsoft in 2007 through an acquisition, taking on a role as a program manager architect. He grew up in France and was living in Paris at the time, but became interested in moving to the US — partly out of curiosity about what it would be like to live there. In 2013, he relocated with his wife and two sons from Paris to Redmond, Washington — home to Microsoft's headquarters — to take a senior program manager role. At the time of his layoff, he was a principal product manager, leading a team of three. While Microsoft's effort to reduce management layers could leave some managers with more direct reports, Melekian said the number of people reporting to him hovered between two and three, depending on business needs — a structure he thinks worked well for his team. He said his role, which required balancing management responsibilities with hands-on project work, didn't change much during his three years as a principal product manager. Having a modest team size gave him the flexibility to spend more time on projects — something he appreciated. "When you have a team of three, you don't have to spend that much time managing," he said. "If a new opportunity came up and everybody was packed, that allowed me to jump in, take some of my own time, and go after it myself." Melekian said he started his principal product manager role during the pandemic, when remote work was widespread at the company. When Microsoft's offices reopened, he had the option to continue working from home and chose to do so. Microsoft's policy currently allows most employees to work remotely at least part of the time, though a decline in productivity could prompt a shift in policy, BI previously reported. Though a layoff is rarely happy news, Melekian said the timing was relatively fortunate: He had already been planning to move back to France for personal and family reasons. With his parents getting older, he wanted to be closer in case they needed support. His youngest son also just graduated from high school and plans to attend school in France this fall. "With our children and our own aging parents all being in France, there was nothing holding my wife and me back in the US," he said. Melekian said he's already sold his home in the US and returned to France, but hasn't started actively job hunting yet. He plans to do so later this summer once he's more settled. When his job search picks up, he's not sure whether he'll prioritize management roles or individual contributor positions. He said he may prefer a role with less managerial responsibility — one where he can have a more direct impact. "Manager roles certainly align with my experience, but I may also consider roles where I can contribute directly with my expertise," he said. Melekian said he has a few pieces of advice for people who are dealing with layoffs or career transitions. First, rely on others for advice and support. "You'd be surprised how willing people are to share their own similar experiences and help you navigate transitions," he said. Additionally, he recommended people keep an open mind to different job opportunities — and not rush their next career decision. "A layoff can feel like a personal failure, but it's usually the result of a broader business shift rather than an indication of your worth as a professional," he said. "Use the pause as an opportunity to reassess what's genuinely important for you personally and professionally." Jump to

Title: What CFOs Need To Know (And Often Don’t) About Company Workers

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. There aren’t many good things to have come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, but a new study of finance professionals from accounts payable software maker AvidXchange pinpoints one of them: Businesses increased their readiness for the unexpected. As businesses navigate an uncertain financial future, two-thirds say they are more prepared to handle it now than five years ago, when many normal flows of global commerce were disrupted by the virus. Since the pandemic, companies have been investing more in strategic financial technology, including for automation, operational effectiveness, forecasting and productivity. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said technology implemented during the pandemic is helping them now, with seven in 10 reporting that technology is at least very important to their ability to continue to respond to market changes. Just having the technology available doesn’t mean that finance professionals are confident in what is coming next, however. The vast majority—86%—are concerned about the state of the economy, and half have deeper concerns about a potential recession. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable financial policy, punctuated by threats of high tariffs that are often delayed and revised, has made planning difficult. Nearly half of all companies are reevaluating their budgets and discretionary spending. Three in 10 are using scenario planning and financial modeling to prepare for a range of outcomes. So far, just over half have made moderate changes to their forecasts because of impending tariffs, but about a quarter that have been minimally impacted so far are monitoring them closely. Close to a fifth—17%—said the tariff threat has significantly disrupted planning and required major adjustments. This survey was taken in late spring—April to May—and many of the proposed tariffs seemed to loom much more in the immediate future. That effective date has shifted through the months, and is now set for August 1. However, one thing that hasn’t changed since this survey was conducted is the unknown nature of the immediate financial picture, which has been a consistent fog over finance departments since January. When companies are being prudent about their finances, one area where they often make cuts is personnel. However, many companies fail to share relevant people data between managers, HR and the finance department, leading companies to cut employees based on salaries alone—a strategy that sometimes will lead to vital knowledge and capabilities being cut, and ultimately losing more money in the long run. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about why companies need to share data to make better informed staffing cuts in difficult times. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. Stocks climbed to fresh all-time highs on Monday. What uncertain economy? Looking at the stock market, the U.S. economy appears to be making fast progress with nothing in its way. The S&P 500 shattered records with two all-time highs in the last week—Monday and Thursday—while the Nasdaq also set a daily record on Monday. Optimism in technology, especially AI, is buoying the markets, with Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Verizon, Qualcomm and Broadcom leading Monday’s rally. Analysts are mixed on whether the rally will continue, with strategists at Goldman Sachs, Wells and Fargo projecting more growth this year. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase and Evercore ISI are projecting a decrease. Positive economic data has helped boost the markets. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Additionally, 83% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Alphabet and Tesla, two of the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies, will report their earnings later this week. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to mitigate the majority of the impact when it comes, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that a distressing sign is emerging from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards. President Donald Trump holds up the just-signed GENIUS Act with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) applauding next to him. The U.S. has regulations in place to govern some types of cryptocurrency. Last week, President Trump signed legislation to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. The new laws put guidelines in place for banks and other entities to issue stablecoins. The new law has been hailed as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Analysts told him that with regulations in place, there will be more momentum to establish and invest in cryptocurrency, both for individual investors and corporate entities. And several companies are looking into the issue. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins as a way to circumvent traditional payment systems. With the ink barely dry on the new law, the earliest impacts have come in the form of runaway valuations on Bitcoin and Ethereum stablecoins. Prices for these tokens have skyrocketed over the last week. Two other Republican-backed bills that would provide more regulation on the industry are currently before the Senate. They would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and divide regulatory jurisdiction for digital assets between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill—dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act—the 50% tax deduction on food and drinks in the office expires on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but the perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work make them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it may be challenging for companies to preserve a non-deductible employee perk. Andrea Derler, Visier Principal, Research and Customer Value. When it’s time to cut costs, financial leaders typically begin by looking at a company’s largest cost center: personnel. But the CFO’s office and the personnel department don’t always have the same data—down to agreeing on total employee counts—and the information the CFO has is usually based on numbers and location, missing important context like job functions and company plans for further growth. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about how everyone in the company can align on its workforce. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. In an ideal business situation, what kind of access would the CFO have of personnel data? Derler: To begin with, what type of data does the organization have? How is it currently processed and integrated? I’m exaggerating here, but she’s probably not going to be interested in seeing a spreadsheet with 300,000 employees. Ideally, it’s in a system where it’s easily accessible to the C-suite. The better it is integrated and actually prepared for results and insights, the easier it becomes. These people don’t have time to play around with the system for half an hour to get to one insight. What’s our headcount? Where’s the diversity in terms of women in leadership positions? How does our projected headcount actually affect our ability to meet our targets next quarter? That needs to be really easily integrated. In terms of the detail and what they see, hopefully they’ll work with the relevant IT and CHRO teams to understand: Can I have access to this and that because I need it for this and that? The collaborative aspect of all of these decisions is increasingly high nowadays because it’s technically possible: Understanding and negotiating access to certain data points and certain business units is really a collaborative effort. There’s a basic set of metrics that are always relevant. We need to know who is going, who is coming in the organization, particularly for workforce planning. You always need to know who is where. Engagement may not be the most important one for the CFO because it’s further away from proof to say it really affects the bottom line. Closer to that would be how many people do we have? Do we have the right skills, and how is it going to affect our projected revenue next year? What are some of the bigger things that go wrong in companies because the CFO doesn’t necessarily have access to good data from HR? We have a massive data set of [about] more 30 million employee records of global industry data. We look at that data constantly. Two years ago, we studied layoffs—reduction in force, turnover, resignation. Most companies have some type of a number we can see in our data. Then I interviewed six CHROs to understand what the decision making process around layoff positions look like? If there’s a very short term calculation: I’m going to save this much if I let 10% go in the next three months, what’s sometimes missing? Sure, you have the cost savings in the short term, but what’s sometimes neglected is what the actual long-term cost is. I’m going to let go 10% now because I think we don’t need them anymore, and currently I‘m going to have to save some costs. Sometimes, what’s not happening is thinking ahead 12 months. We want to grow again after the difficult economic times. Now, I’m going to have to rehire individuals or find new replacement employees. We know that hiring new employees is generally much more expensive than keeping existing employees and helping them either internally to find different roles or reskill them. There’s a lot of academic research and also industry research that found that layoffs most of the time are not really financially making sense because the planning capabilities don’t always exist. If the CFO knew how much it’s going to cost their company to rehire, knowing it may cost a lot more, giving us another headache in two years time, [they may advise against it]. They had only the financial data and said, ‘Oh man, we are spending way too much on wages. We’re going to have to make some cost savings.’ That’s for lack of data integration. That’s for lack of the ability to collaborate and look at the same data set and do thorough scenario planning, very much to the detriment, not only of the employees who are being let go, but even financially, it doesn’t make sense most of the time. What advice would you give to a CFO who wants to make the best financial decisions in the long run for their company when it comes to personnel, and feels like they need to have more access to information? The first thing, very practically, I would recommend that they would go to their counterparts— CHRO or IT—and find out how solidly set up they are from a technology and analytics perspective in terms of what do we have? How are we set up? Are we still working on spreadsheets? What questions can you answer for me here and now—not tomorrow, next week, not in two months, because we still have to do all the calculations manually. That would be an expectation that the CFO can reasonably have, to say, ‘Well, if we want to make good decisions, that’s what we need.’ Secondly, gauge the appetite. If it’s not in place, make a business case for it and say, ‘I will be able to make more solid financial decisions if I have the solid HR data behind me. I can make a decision faster and be more agile. That’s a big selling point. Currently, with all that’s happening in the economy, it’s very hard to plan ahead. You need agility and the ability to look something up today. Find out what’s in place. If nothing’s in place, what’s the appetite, and who are the stakeholders that I need to engage with within the company? The third important task that they could do by themselves is list what’s missing for me right now in terms of people data. These are the table stakes five questions that I need to be able to answer so I can, as a CFO, make meaningful decisions, or help at least advise the board or others on those decisions. Businesses do want to make money, but your success and longevity may depend on your ability to do something else: create value for your customers. Here are some ways to make a shift away from pure profit, but possibly a better market position. If you want to add some leadership insight to your summer reading list, here are six books to help you reflect on your shortcomings and learn how to lead your team more effectively.

Title: What Amazon Prime Day Predicts About Upcoming Holiday Shopping Trends

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Amazon Prime Day saw mixed results: initial sales reports were disputed, final growth was estimated to be modest (4.9%), and web traffic declined. However, consumers showed strong purchase intent, actively seeking deals across retailers due to inflation. Analysts project 2.5-3% Q4 retail growth, highlighting consumer resilience despite economic uncertainties and potential supply chain challenges. Happy family and their daughter shopping online for Christmas Controversy erupted early on July 8, the first of Amazon Prime Day’s four-day sales extravaganza. Momentum Commerce, which manages $7 billion in sales annually on Amazon, reported first day sales were down 41% compared to last year. An Amazon spokesperson fired back, telling Forbes that the report was “highly inaccurate” and that Momentum Commerce, a third-party consultancy firm, didn’t have access to the full dataset. However, the damage was done, thanks to the anchoring bias where the news broke, it was already stained in people’s memory. Amazon’s post-Prime Day wrap-up didn’t help, since it provided no sales figures or any hint at growth. It claimed record-breaking sales, but it didn’t factor in the fact that the event went from two to four days. With two more days, Amazon was bound to break records. Questions remained even after Adobe Analytics reported that aggregated four-day e-commerce sales exceeded projections, totaling $24.1 billion in online retail sales on a 30.3% year-over-year increase. Increasingly, analysts look to Prime Day results to help forecast holiday retail performance. The apples-to-oranges comparison complicates an already complicated picture. Digging into a variety of sources provides a clearer picture of how Amazon performed over Prime Day and where the retail market is headed into the holiday season. Let’s start here: Consumers didn’t wait until July Prime Day to pick up their shopping pace. For June, retailers posted a 0.6% seasonally adjusted uptick in spending from May and a 3.7% unadjusted increase year-over-year. While Momentum’s first day report was discredited, it released a final estimate that Amazon Prime Day sales over the four days generated 4.9% total sales growth compared to the combined performance of 2024's two-day Prime Day and the two days immediately following. That fell well under Momentum’s prediction of 9.1% growth for Amazon over the four-day event. Momentum also expected that demand would be softer during the first two days and would build on days three and four. Similarweb, which tracks online traffic, found in an apples-to-apples comparison that Amazon web traffic was down. Average daily visits to Amazon.com dropped 15% comparing last year’s two-day event (July 16 and 17) to this year’s four-days (July 8 to 11). FOMO (fear of missing out) played in Amazon’s favor in 2024. And app usage followed a similar downward trajectory. Last year’s two-day event averaged 113.9 million visitors per day compared to an average of 104.1 million per day over the four-days, a 9% drop. Nonetheless, Amazon still attracted over 400 million visitors to this year’s Prime Day. However, when shoppers showed up to Amazon Prime Day, they came loaded for bear, according to a post-Prime Day survey conducted among 400 consumers by Coresight Research. Some 48% of consumers reported making a purchase, compared with 38% last year and bettering the 34% who planned to make a purchase, based on a May pre-event survey. There also was a significant increase in the share of 2025 Amazon Prime Day shoppers who reported spending more (43%) compared to 31% last year. Coresight’s consumer research also revealed shoppers widely engaged with competing sales events hosted by Walmart and Target. Over one-third of consumers reported they compared offerings across multiple retailers. They also mixed planned with spontaneous impulse buys and were motivated by early access offers and staggered promotional deals. Commenting on the survey results, Coresight’s John Mercer, who manages the firm’s global research, noted that there was a significant amount of opportunistic shopping behavior this year tied to Prime Day, as consumers sought to maximize value across competing sales events. “When consumers are cautious about inflation or the macro-environment, as we’ve seen in previous holiday seasons, they tend to pull forward some spending to spread out costs,” he said. “We think that is the case this year with consumers having concerns about inflation-driven price rises late in the season.” We’ll have to wait until Amazon reports on July 31 to get a better accounting. It’s up against a comparative 9% increase to $90 billion in North America net sales in the second quarter last year, excluding AWS. In the first quarter, North America sales advanced 8% to $92.9 billion. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Mercer and the Coresight team see positive momentum, despite widespread consumer concern about tariffs increasing prices as the year advances. Coresight provided three possible scenarios for fourth-quarter retail performance. The most likely is retail growth in the 2.5% to 3% range, what it calls the central scenario. Interestingly, Coresight’s machine-learning model forecasts a 3.5% year-over-year increase, the upside scenario. However, the analyst team considers the more moderate growth forecast to be more “reasonable,” with a 45% overall probability versus a 30% probability for the upside scenario. Coresight also figures there is a 25% probability that retail sales will decline by 2.5% or more in the fourth quarter, should the economy take a turn for the worse with increased layoffs and rising prices causing consumer sentiment to deteriorate. “This would accelerate deal-seeking consumer behaviors and could ultimately contribute to stagflation (slow economic growth and persistently high inflation) or a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth),” Coresight warned. Another confounding factor that might mitigate retail growth in the fourth quarter is what Mercer described as the “lumpy” supply chain. Retailers picked up imports before April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, followed by a slump and another surge after the worse of the tariffs were postponed to August 1. “It makes it hard to match demand with supply,” he said. “So if we get to the holiday season and there is relatively solid consumer demand, the supply may not be there to match it. We could see a replay of holiday 2021, when consumers saw bare shelves and struggled to get some products. “Markdowns were far fewer then and more was sold at full price. So counterintuitively, we could end up seeing less discounting this holiday if the lumpy supply chain doesn’t match up to consumer demand,” he said. Despite the doomsday headlines surrounding tariff uncertainty, retail sales have climbed 3.6% through the first half of 2025 to total $4.2 trillion. While inflation inched up in June to 2.7% from 2.4% in May, it’s still below the first-half 2024 average of 3.3%. By contrast, inflation has averaged 2.6% from January to June 2025. Notably, January to June 2024 retail sales rose 2.6% over 2023 – lagging behind inflation. That’s not the case in 2025, where retail growth has outpaced rising prices, underscoring consumer momentum and resilience. “Consumers continue to spend in the face of uncertainty and shrugging off tariff concerns, with U.S. retail sales showing relative stability compared to last month and outpacing inflation compared to a year ago,” said Katie Thomas, Kearney Consumer Institute. While many observers expect retail sales to slow as the year progresses after the full force of tariffs hit, American consumer resilience could defy expectations and keep retail going strong, making Coresight’s upside 3.5% fourth-quarter growth scenario a distinct possibility.
