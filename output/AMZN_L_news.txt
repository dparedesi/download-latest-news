There's certainly no shortage of choice when it comes to what to buy during the Steam Winter Sale. Hundreds, if not thousands, of games are available for cheaper than ever before. While the Featured Deep Discounts and sales for some of the biggest games of the year are worth looking at, the Steam Winter Sale is also a great time to get some of 2025's most underrated games. Specifically, for fans of tabletop role-playing games and games that explore the different ways we interact with the medium, I'd highly recommend Secret Door and Dreamhaven's Sunderfolk. Typically $50, Sunderfolk is discounted by 40% to just $30 during this Steam Winter Sale. If you're willing to use your phone to control a tactics RPG with some friends, you'll discover one of the most underrated games of the year. In 2020, former Activision Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime founded Dreamhaven, a new game publisher and parent company to multiple development studios. Sunderfolk was the first internally developed game that they released, and it was quite the bold swing for a first game. It's a cooperative, turn-based tactical RPG meant to be a digital replacement for your tabletop board game night. In it, you play as cute animals who fit classic RPG archetypes like tank, warrior, and mage, and go on missions with your friends to save the home village of Arden. I personally like playing as the Pyromancer, a salamander that powers up by stepping into the fire his attacks leave behind on tiles. Actress Anjali Bhimani also put in impressive work for Sunderfolk, voicing every single character and the narrator in the game. The one catch, if you want to call it that, in all of this is that you have to use an app on your phone to control your character in Sunderfolk. Your on-screen cursor movement, move selection, and character upgrades between missions are all handled from a smartphone screen. That may sound gimmicky and off-putting to some, but buy in and you'll actually find this setup feels surprisingly intuitive. Mechanically, it's an impressive tactics game, with varied mission objectives, unique player abilities, and creative ways for players to interact and assist one another. If you can wrangle up a group of friends to play the game (only one copy is required), it truly offers some of the most fun of any multiplayer game released in 2025. It's even possible to play it alone, although that's not ideal. Regardless, Sunderfolk is an incredibly charming game that I wish more people knew about. While I really enjoy Sunderfolk and its Jackbox-meets-D&D approach to multiplayer RPG gaming, it was not an overnight success for Dreamhaven following its launch in April of this year. According to a Bloomberg report, it sold only about 62,000 copies in its first four months on the market. Its Android app has 100,000+ downloads. Layoffs did occur at Dreamhaven in August. I credit Sunderfolk's underperformance to a couple of different factors. First, it's hard to convince hardcore RPG video game fans to adopt such a complex way to play a new RPG due to the stigma surrounding mobile games. Meanwhile, tabletop gamers chose to stick with their physical games. It also didn't help that Sunderfolk launched on April 23, the same week The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. As players had two fantastic RPGs, capitalizing on nostalgia to choose from, something as experimental as Sunderfolk didn't capture players' attention like those titles did. This game is at its best when multiple people are convinced to play it over an extended period of time. The time and interest buy-in required, and the release timing, just didn't work in Sunderfolk's favor. That makes a quiet late December for new game releases the perfect time to release it. To Secret Door and Dreamhaven's credit, they also haven't abandoned the game. Its app is still operational, and a free trial for those curious but not convinced is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. A post-launch update added the ability to do one-shot missions rather than a whole campaign, while an update next year is set to add a new playable character, more missions, and even the ability to play the game with mouse and keyboard rather than a phone. That support gives me the confidence to recommend Sunderfolk at its current 40% discount. If you missed out on Sunderfolk around the time it was released, it's worth picking up now that it's just $30 during the Steam Winter Sale. For those who are still skeptical of using a phone as a controller, I recommend trying the free trial first; you'll come away impressed. You could also wait to play it until keyboard and mouse controls are added next year, but still buy it at a discount now. So many games fall through the cracks of the gaming zeitgeist every year, and Sunderfolk is one that deserves another chance. While throwback RPGs are comfort food, something like Sunderfolk is innovating the ways that keep the genre interesting. Phone interesting may not catch on outside of Netflix or Amazon Luna's casual games, but some other game design ideas from this game can live on in future RPGs. $30 is more than worth it if you want to play a game that's trying something new and not just iterating on the same old concepts.

Title: A major overhaul of League of Legends is reportedly coming in 2027: 'Once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League'

Riot has big plans for attracting new players to its aging MOBA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new Bloomberg report says Riot Games is currently working on an update to League of Legends, known internally as League Next, that will be the biggest in the game's history. The overhaul of League's "visual aesthetic," as Bloomberg put it, will impact characters, battle arenas, and the interface, and is aimed at making the game more welcoming for new players. League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in. The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios. The games that emerged from that program, including Ruined King, Mageseeker, Bandle Tale, Song of Nunu, and Convergence, were generally well received but failed to attract significant audiences. Another round of layoffs at Riot followed in October, as Riot co-founder Marc Merrill indicated that the studio was looking back to its foundational MOBA for future success. "This isn't about reducing headcount to save money," Merrill said at the time. "It's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond. While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League." After the Bloomberg report went out, Riot posted a video that didn't exactly deny what was in it. Pointedly entitled "A look at some of our plans for League after 2026," the video has executive producer Paul "Pabro" Bellezza and head of studio Andrei "Meddler" van Roon acknowledging that the studio has "been working on some bigger updates to League." A look at some of our plans for League after 2026. pic.twitter.com/vqsnBksg1YDecember 18, 2025 "For starters, we're making a brand-new around-game client that's fully integrated with the in-game experience, rather than being a separate application like today," van Roon says. Bellezza then jumps in to say, "We're also revamping Summoner's Rift with entirely new visuals, and a bit of new gameplay," and then adds, pointedly, that Riot is "overhauling the new player experience, so that once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It definitely isn't a comprehensive look at what's coming in some post-2026 timeframe, but it does sound very much like it will be very big indeed. Whether it succeeds in attracting new players to League, or merely annoys the existing old-timers, is an entirely separate question, and the irony is that Riot's co-domination of the MOBA space, alongside Valve's Dota 2, has made life extremely difficult for newcomers. Supervive, developed by a team of Riot veterans and released just five months ago, announced earlier this week that it will close down in February; Seekers of Skyveil had an even shorter lifespan, Gigantic: Rampage Edition has literally zero players on Steam, and Amazon recently opted to sell March of Giants to Ubisoft rather than release it. League of Legends may be aging out, but whether there's an appetite for some kind of 'League 2.0' remains to be seen. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Games industry layoff figures were down slightly in 2025 – but it was still horrendous | Year in Review

Although layoffs were down by around a third, studios in the US and Western Europe may have been hit by the trend for jobs moving to emerging markets Conditions remain tough in the games industry, and layoff figures were still high in 2025, although down from their peak in 2024. Amir Satvat, business development director at Tencent Games, maintains a widely used resource for helping people find jobs in the games industry, and for the past few years he has been tracking and forecasting layoff numbers. Crucially, he attempts to include layoffs that were not publicly reported, as well as using his community connections to find out actual figures for layoffs when companies report them without listing the numbers of people affected. At the time of writing, Satvat has settled on a figure of 9,175 games industry layoffs in 2025, just shy of the prediction of 9,769 he made back in January. That's dramatically down on the estimated 15,631 layoffs in 2024, although still higher than the estimated 8,500 layoffs in 2022, when the current games industry crisis kicked in. Satvat predicts that we'll see another 7,500 layoffs in 2026, pointing towards a slow recovery in the industry. However, he thinks that the share of open roles in North America and Western Europe will continue to decrease. Earlier this year, he told The Games Business that "over 70%, and in some years 75%, of the layoffs have been in North America," with AAA studios being particularly affected, and with more than 50% of cuts taking place in California. Similarly, a survey released in October found more than 26% of European game professionals were laid off in the past year, with median salaries dropping dramatically compared with 2024. "Salaries for programmers – especially Unity developers – have dropped by almost half, mainly because there are barely any open positions," said Tanja Loktionova, founder of Values Value and co-founder of InGame Job, the companies behind the survey. "There have been a lot of layoffs and very few new opportunities." Satvat predicts that whereas job opportunities will decrease in Western Europe and North America, they will increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. That tallies with comments made during this year's GamesIndustry.biz Investment Panel by Lirui Ding, principal at the gaming venture capital firm Transcend Fund, about the games industry's ongoing geographical shift. "We're really seeing a lot of money actually going from the US and Europe to other emerging markets," he explained, "whether it's China, Turkey, or even Vietnam." Chris Petrovic, chief business officer and board chairman at the developer and publisher FunPlus, made similar comments in a GamesIndustry.biz feature in December, where he predicted that the industry would grow, but in different areas of the globe. "Previously, we talked a lot about gaming innovation, creativity, and commercial success coming from places like the United States, Canada, Germany, and Finland," he said, "and now we are increasingly talking about emerging game dev hubs like China, Turkey, Israel, and Vietnam." 2025 saw a number of studio closures, including Toadman Interactive, Freejam, nDreams Studio Orbital and nDreams Studio, Thunderful-owned Studio Fizbin, Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop Studios, Zynga-owned Echtra Games, Dundee-based Cobra Mobile, Microsoft-owned The Initiative, Avalanche Studios Group's Liverpool studio, Ubisoft Leamington, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, Fantastic Pixel Castle, and Bad Brain Game Studios. Reports also alleged that Ballistic Moon, the UK-based developer of the Until Dawn remake, was "effectively closed" after almost all its staff were laid off, while Aheartfulofgames, the Spanish studio behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, said it faced closure after owner Outright Games signalled its intention to make all employees at the studio redundant. In addition, the UK-based studios Three Fields Entertainment and Splash Damage both began redundancy consultations affecting all employees. Dozens of studios cut staff numbers in 2025, including: In terms of the biggest gaming companies, Tencent Games made a number of cuts and divestments at its European studios. In February, the Tencent-owned Sumo Group announced it would be refocusing "exclusively on development services for partners," which would "have an impact on our studios and people." It sold off publisher Secret Mode in March. In June, Sumo-owned studio The Chinese Room made a small number of layoffs before revealing it would be going independent. In January, Splash Damage – which was bought by Tencent in 2020 – said jobs were at risk following the cancellation of Transformers: Reactivate. In September, the studio said it had been acquired by private-equity investors, then in November the entire studio was placed in consultation ahead of redundancies. In October, Oslo-based Funcom, which is owned by Tencent and is behind the open-world survival game Dune: Awakening, said it would be making job cuts as part of a restructuring. And in November, Tencent-owned studio Sharkmob, which is working on the sci-fi extraction shooter Exoborne, said it was making job cuts at its Malmo studio. NetEase studio Jar of Sparks said in January that it would be looking for a new publishing partner after NetEase pulled its funding. "As we prepare for this next step, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities," said founder and CEO Jerry Hook. Then in February, the NetEase-backed studio Liquid Swords, which was established by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios, reported a round of job cuts. A few days later, NetEase confirmed layoffs at a US support studio for Marvel Rivals, hours before revealing the game had 40 million players. NetEase also shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment, divested Fantastic Pixel Castle (which subsequently closed), and pulled out of Bad Brain Game Studios, a studio it had set up in 2023, which closed after it failed to find a new publisher. Microsoft made some major job cuts in 2025. After a relatively small round of layoffs in January, the firm announced a 3% cut to its staff in May. But the biggest round of job cuts came in July, affecting an estimated 9,000 people, or around 4% of Microsoft's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in Microsoft's games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Microsoft's console rival Sony made cuts too, laying off staff at the PlayStation support studio Visual Arts and PS Studios Malaysia, as well as initiating redundancies at Days Gone maker Bend Studio. Unity implemented another round of cuts in February, following around 1,800 job losses in January 2024, and Amazon announced an enormous 14,000 layoffs in October, which resulted in work ceasing on the MMO New World. Intel, meanwhile, announced layoffs in April and July as part of cost-cutting measures. Meta laid off a number of people in 2025, cutting 5% of staff in January, and then making further cuts to the Reality Labs division in April. But there could be bigger cuts to come, after Bloomberg reported that Meta is allegedly planning to slash budgets in its Reality Labs division by as much as 30% in 2026. Netflix-owned Night School Studio cut an undisclosed number of staff in February, and Krafton-owned Striking Distance Studios – which was behind The Callisto Protocol – made layoffs in March. Square Enix, meanwhile, implemented a "fundamental restructuring" in November, pulling resources away from "overseas" development studios and putting over 100 jobs at risk. Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics cut staff in March, August, and November, before unveiling Tomb Raider: Catalyst at the Game Awards in December, which is being published by Amazon. In addition, the Embracer studio Eidos Montreal, which was behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, was allegedly hit with layoffs in December, following an earlier round of cuts in March. Ubisoft made numerous job cuts in 2025. In January, it made redundancies at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections, and announced the closure of Ubisoft Leamington. Then in July, it announced 19 layoffs at the Tom Clancy: Ghost Recon studio Red Storm, followed by nine job losses in the publishing team in September. Finally, in October, it unveiled a "restructuring proposal" for the Finland-based RedLynx studio that could affect up to 60 positions, shortly before announcing plans to offer voluntary redundancies to staff at its Swedish subsidiary Massive Entertainment. EA also cut a number of jobs this year, beginning with the EA studio Respawn cancelling two "early-stage" incubation projects and cutting developers from its Apex Legends and Star Wars: Jedi teams, resulting in approximately 100 layoffs. On the same day, EA announced a further 200 job losses, chiefly affecting EA's Experiences team. A day later, EA said it was "pausing development" of the World Rally Championship series, leading to layoffs at Codemasters. Finally, there were a number of cuts at studios owned by Take-Two Interactive. 2K Games confirmed in August that it had "reduced the size of the development team" working on BioShock 4, which is being developed by the Californian studio Cloud Chamber. Then in September, 2K confirmed a "reduction" in the headcount at Civilization and XCOM developer Firaxis. But most controversially, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Take-Two-owned Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate.

Title: Leading Advanced Machine Learning Course by Interview Kickstart Gets Agentic AI Update - LIVE Online Classes by FAANG+ AI/ML Engineers

December 19, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While much of the public narrative around the technology sector has focused on layoffs and workforce reductions, industry analysts point to a parallel and more consequential shift unfolding beneath the headlines. One organization addressing the growing gap between AI talent demand and available expertise is Interview Kickstart, whose Advanced Machine Learning Course is designed to help professionals build production-ready AI skills aligned with hiring expectations at large technology companies. Major technology companies are concentrating resources around artificial intelligence engineering at an unprecedented scale, signaling a structural transformation in how technical talent is hired, organized, and valued across the industry. The multi-month program spans core programming fundamentals through advanced machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and deployment practices, with instruction led by engineers from FAANG and other Tier-1 firms. More information about the course is available at https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course#interview-preparation. Public workforce data and industry research indicate that AI engineering teams at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Meta have expanded significantly over the past several years, even as broader headcount reductions occurred elsewhere. By late 2024, these firms collectively employed tens of thousands of engineers in roles dedicated to machine learning, generative AI, data infrastructure, and applied AI systems. Analysts note that this concentration of AI expertise has few historical precedents in the technology sector. This expansion reflects deliberate strategic repositioning rather than reactive hiring. In the years leading up to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools, large technology firms increased investment in AI talent, computing infrastructure, and internal research capacity. Hiring trends from 2019 through 2024 show sustained growth in specialized AI roles, suggesting that companies were anticipating changes in how products and services would be built and delivered. Notably, this hiring momentum continued even during periods of broader workforce contraction. While companies reduced staffing in areas such as marketing, operations, and general administration, AI engineering teams were largely protected and, in some cases, expanded. Industry observers interpret this as a clear signal that AI-related roles are viewed as central to long-term competitiveness rather than discretionary investments. The resulting labor market has become increasingly segmented. Professionals with experience building and deploying AI systems at scale are in high demand, while roles centered on routine implementation or narrowly scoped tasks face growing automation pressure. Recruiters report that AI engineering positions often require experience beyond theoretical knowledge, including hands-on work with large language models, data pipelines, distributed systems, and production deployment. This demand has outpaced supply. Despite sustained hiring efforts, many organizations report difficulty filling AI engineering roles due to a shortage of candidates with relevant, production-level experience. As a result, qualified professionals are often able to choose among multiple opportunities, particularly at organizations with significant AI infrastructure and research investments. However, industry analysts emphasize that access to these roles depends on depth of expertise. Companies are not simply seeking familiarity with AI concepts; they are evaluating candidates on their ability to design, implement, and maintain complex systems under real-world constraints. This includes considerations such as scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and responsible deployment. The distinction between conceptual understanding and applied expertise has become increasingly important. Professionals who have built and operated AI systems in production environments are better positioned to meet hiring criteria than those whose exposure is limited to coursework or isolated experiments. This has led many engineers and data professionals to pursue structured upskilling as a way to bridge the gap. Interview Kickstart's Advanced Machine Learning Course is structured around this industry reality. The program emphasizes applied learning through live instruction, hands-on projects, and capstone work modeled on real business scenarios across sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare, cybersecurity, and financial technology. According to the company, the curriculum is regularly updated to reflect emerging requirements, including agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, scalable model deployment, and machine learning operations. In addition to technical training, the program integrates interview preparation and career coaching. Participants engage in mock interviews with instructors who have experience hiring for AI and ML roles, along with resume and behavioral coaching designed to reflect evaluation standards at large technology firms. This combination aims to align skill development with real-world hiring processes. Industry observers note that as AI adoption accelerates, the need for professionals who can translate AI capabilities into reliable products and systems will continue to grow. Structured programs that combine technical depth with practical application may play an increasingly important role in preparing professionals for this evolving landscape.

Title: New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-lottery-new-rules-salary-big-tech-students-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:22:01Z
Full Content:
The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 85,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in. This fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out. The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments on the rule and preparing the final text. Three months after President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B workers, Business Insider has assessed what's changed, who is benefiting, and who is getting hurt. Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one. Suddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company. The Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been "deliberately exploited" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts. In a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to "root out fraud." "The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended," Tragesser said. Meanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules. A State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis. Immigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies. The fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots. Large enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms. Justin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success. The wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery. "Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission," said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups "may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system." One exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high. Under the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal. New grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all. Alcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules. On paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said. The Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent. The tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding. Immigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance. Domestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches. "One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing," said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. "Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday." Correction: December 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of H-1B visas approved annually. The cap is 85,000 visas. Jump to

Title: How Amazon's 8.5% layoff in Luxembourg raises difficult questions for Indian foreign workers

When Amazon announced 14,000 cuts globally earlier this week, a number of these were from its tech unit in Luxembourg. Bloomberg reported that the retail giant is culling 8.5% or 370 of its 4,370 employees in the tiny European nation, its largest such job cuts here in around 20 years. The Amazon layoffs could also pose an impossible situation for Indian and other foreign workers in Luxembourg, who are likely to be among those affected. The redundancies are “adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies,” Amazon said in a memo to staff on 12 December, adding that the severance package “goes well beyond industry benchmarks”. The Luxembourg Labor Minister’s office didn’t return a request for comment on the layoffs. The Duchy of Luxembourg has employees from the United States, Australia, Egypt, India, and Tunisia working at Amazon. If any of these staff are among those fired, they will have to find another job within three months or return home. Speaking to Bloomberg, Prash Chandrasekhar, a member of the Amazon employee delegation, said some employees may have to leave the country. “I am almost sure some employees will have to leave. It’s not easy to find a job in Luxembourg, for 370 people entering the job market at the same time,” he said. Chandrasekhar added that for those seeking work in big tech in particular, there is no real alternative to Amazon. Notably, to fire employees in the European Union (EU), companies must hold negotiations with employee representatives and sometimes the government. After two weeks of such discussions, Amazon reduced its job cuts in Luxembourg from 470 to 370, Bloomberg added. Amazon will notify a number of the affected employees of their termination in February, Chandrasekhar said. The report added that Amazon's layoffs in the 680,000-population country could trigger some “speed bumps” in the so far mutually beneficial relationship between the tech giant and tax haven nation. Luxembourg is known as a tax haven and financial centre with relatively high wages and low-income taxes, which have benefited many foreign companies. Amazon has since 2003 steadily expanded in the country and even after the layoffs will be Luxembourg’s fifth-largest employer. An employee told Bloomberg anonymously that most of the cuts are expected to be among software developers as artificial intelligence (AI) use grows, and to “trim” the workforce hired during the pandemic-era boom. The General Luxembourg Workers’ Organization (OGBL) union and other unions allege that Amazon has been granted “outsized” tax benefits in Luxembourg. The BB report said that Amazon and other foreign companies have set up holding companies in Luxembourg, through which they funnel European operations. It added that Amazon uses accounting rules deemed legal by European courts in 2023 to routinely declare losses on its continental operations and minimise tax burden. Last year, according to public records, the Luxembourg-based holding company Amazon EU Sarl reported €70.4 billion ($82.8 billion) in EU e-commerce sales and almost the same amount of expenses, including employee costs, leaving the company with a tax on profit of just €180 million. In November, Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden met Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in Seattle, and later stressed in a LinkedIn post that the company remains a “vital partner” for Luxembourg. In a comment under the post, Jassy replied, “Luxembourg’s been an important home for Amazon and our 4,000 teammates there. Appreciated the discussion and partnership.” (With inputs from Bloomberg) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

December 18, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SANTA CLARA, CA - December 18, 2025 - - The global technology sector is entering a period of structural workforce realignment as artificial intelligence reshapes how work is performed inside large enterprises. Recent layoffs across major technology firms, coupled with record levels of investment in AI infrastructure and automation, indicate a strategic shift in hiring priorities rather than a cyclical slowdown, according to industry analysts tracking employment and capital allocation trends across the sector. One organization addressing this shift is Interview Kickstart, an upskilling platform that offers training programs focused on AI, machine learning, and advanced engineering roles thorugh its Advanced Generative AI program. Publicly reported data indicates that more than 100,000 roles have been eliminated across the global technology sector in 2025, with workforce reductions occurring at companies commonly grouped under the FAANG umbrella as well as other large enterprises. These workforce changes have coincided with sustained investment in AI-related initiatives, including infrastructure, tooling, and research, signaling a reallocation of resources rather than a retreat from innovation. Executives at several major technology companies have acknowledged that AI is altering how work is performed. Public statements from industry leaders have emphasized the need for organizations to redesign workflows, automate routine tasks, and increase productivity through AI-assisted systems. In many cases, this has involved consolidating teams and prioritizing roles that focus on system-level decision-making, AI deployment, and operational oversight. At the same time, companies have continued to invest heavily in AI platforms and services. Financial disclosures and earnings calls across the sector show that capital expenditure on AI infrastructure has increased year over year, reflecting long-term strategic commitments. Industry observers note that this combination of workforce reductions and AI investment suggests a structural realignment of job roles rather than a contraction of the technology sector as a whole. This environment has created a complex landscape for technology professionals. Roles centered on routine implementation, manual processes, or narrowly defined responsibilities are increasingly vulnerable to automation. Conversely, demand continues to grow for professionals who can design, build, deploy, and manage AI systems in production environments. These roles often require a blend of engineering fundamentals, applied AI knowledge, and the ability to evaluate trade-offs in complex systems. Recruiters and hiring managers report that job descriptions are evolving accordingly. Many roles now emphasize experience with machine learning pipelines, generative AI systems, autonomous agents, and AI-assisted workflows, alongside traditional software engineering and system design skills. This has prompted many professionals to reassess their skill sets and pursue structured upskilling as a way to remain competitive. Interview Kickstart provides structured learning pathways designed to help professionals develop applied skills aligned with current hiring expectations at large technology firms. The offerings include multi-month programs that cover foundational machine learning concepts, deep learning, generative AI, and agent-based systems. The curriculum emphasizes practical application, with live instruction and project work intended to reflect real-world use cases. According to the company, these programs are designed to support professionals transitioning from adjacent technical roles as well as those seeking deeper specialization in AI-driven systems. In addition to technical instruction, Interview Kickstart integrates interview preparation and career coaching into its programs. Participants receive feedback from instructors with industry experience, along with mock interviews designed to mirror hiring processes at large technology companies. This approach reflects the increasingly rigorous evaluation standards used for AI-related roles, which often assess both technical depth and decision-making ability. Industry analysts note that traditional, short-term upskilling approaches may be insufficient in this environment. As AI capabilities expand, employers are placing greater value on professionals who can operate across the full lifecycle of AI systems, from design and deployment to monitoring and optimization. This has elevated the importance of sustained, structured learning over ad hoc skill acquisition. While the pace of change has introduced uncertainty for many technology workers, it has also clarified the types of expertise likely to remain relevant. Professionals with production-level AI experience, strong engineering fundamentals, and the ability to adapt to evolving tools are expected to play a central role in the next phase of the technology sector's development. As companies continue to integrate AI into their operations, workforce transformation is likely to remain a defining feature of the industry. For professionals navigating this transition, access to structured education and practical training may be a key factor in aligning their skills with the demands of an AI-driven economy.

Title: The AI efficiency illusion: why cutting 1.1 million jobs will stifle, not scale, your strategy
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/18/the-ai-efficiency-illusion-why-cutting-1-1-million-jobs-will-stifle-not-scale-your-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T18:23:12Z
Full Content:
We are witnessing a false dawn of efficiency. Throughout 2025, corporate America has engaged in a frantic restructuring of the labor market, cutting more than 1.17 million jobs in the first 11 months of the year, a 54% increase from 2024. From the 14,000 corporate cuts at tech giants like Amazon to the nearly 300,000 federal civil service reductions, the narrative driving this contraction is uniform: we are shedding excess labor to make room for the streamlined, high-margin future of artificial intelligence. But the data tells a different story. This is not a calculated pivot toward higher productivity. It is a hollowing-out strategy that trades immediate payroll savings for a catastrophic erosion of human capital. By viewing AI as a mechanism for replacement rather than augmentation, leaders are incurring a strategic debt that will erase future value, stifle innovation, and, crucially, institutionalize the kind of algorithmic bias that costs companies billions. We are trying to build the future of work by burning down the infrastructure required to support it. The prevailing logic in the C-Suite is a simple subtraction equation: lower headcount plus automated tools equals higher margins. However, this ignores the negative externalities imposed on the workforce that remains. While companies explicitly cited AI for roughly 55,000 cuts through November, there are far more job losses buried under the umbrella of restructuring, which accounted for over 128,000 job losses. Expert estimates suggest the true automation-influenced displacement is likely above 150,000. But the real cost isn’t on the severance line item; it is in the collapse of productivity among the survivors. Seventy-four percent of employees who survive layoffs report a decline in their own productivity, while 77% witness an increase in operational errors. This phenomenon, often called the layoff survivor syndrome, is a drag on performance fueled by anxiety and the erosion of institutional trust. Volatility sends a signal to your top performers: leave before you are pushed out. When companies cut costs by eliminating human capacity, they don’t get a leaner organization; they get an anxious, risk-averse, and error-prone one. The so-called productivity equation turns negative because the marginal productivity of the retained workforce plummets faster than the payroll costs decline. This productivity collapse is compounded by a fundamental misunderstanding of how AI generates value. While 85% of organizations are increasing their AI investment, only 6% are seeing a payback in under a year. The answer lies in the implementation. A staggering 59% of organizations are taking a technology-first approach, treating AI as a bolt-on solution rather than undertaking organizational redesign. Even more alarming is where the cuts are happening. The 2025 layoffs are disproportionately targeting mid-layer management, including HR, talent acquisition, and compliance roles. The result is a growing governance gap. At the exact moment companies are deploying black-box algorithms that require intense oversight, they are firing the overseers. 34% of organizations already expect a shortage in specialist compliance skills. By dismantling these internal guardrails, companies are not streamlining; they are removing the ethical braking systems required to prevent reputational and financial ruin. AI is not a replacement for human judgment; it is an accelerator of it. But you cannot accelerate what you have already liquidated. Here is where the economic argument becomes inseparable from the equity argument. The hollowing out of 2025 has not been neutral. It has systematically targeted the very demographics that drive financial outperformance. The data reveal a profound asymmetry in risk exposure. Women are significantly more vulnerable to the current wave of automation, with 79% of employed women concentrated in high-risk occupations compared to 58% of men. This differential means women are 1.4 times more exposed to displacement. We see this specifically in the hollowing out of critical pipeline positions that enable women to ascend to leadership. However, the canary in the coal mine for the broader economy is the crisis facing Black women. By November 2025, the unemployment rate for Black women remained at a staggering 7.1%, more than double the 3.4% rate for White women. This was driven by a perfect storm: high exposure to private sector automation combined with the erasure of 300,000 federal jobs, a sector where Black women have historically found stability. The reality on the ground confirms this is a systemic failure, not a skills gap. Keisha Bross, Director of Opportunity, Race and Justice at the NAACP, reports that she has “not seen interventions happening” to support this displaced workforce. The result? At recent NAACP job fairs, 80% of applicants held bachelor’s degrees yet were lining up for same-day interviews for low-wage roles. We are witnessing the hollowing out of the Black middle class in real-time. Leaders often view these statistics as a social problem. They are wrong. This is a P&L problem. There is a hard, quantitative link between intersectional equity and revenue. Research across more than 4,000 companies in 29 countries shows that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there is a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Venture capital data further reinforces this, showing that investments in female-founded startups yield a 63% better return on investment than those with male founders. By allowing layoffs to disproportionately target women and people of color, companies are forfeiting a measurable economic dividend. The financial danger of a homogenous workforce extends directly into the AI models themselves. If your AI team and your data sources lack diversity, your algorithms will be biased. This is no longer a theoretical risk—it is a tangible liability. More than one-third of organizations have already suffered negative impacts from AI bias, with 62% reporting lost revenue and 61% reporting lost customers. The legal doctrine of disparate impact creates massive liability for companies whose algorithms discriminate in hiring or lending, regardless of intent. This tension is starkly visible. On one side, we have the nation’s largest civil rights organization, the NAACP, flagging systemic risk. On the other, we have tech giants like Google and Meta, recently crowned Time’s ‘Person of the Year’, who landed on the NAACP’s Consumer Advisory List by rolling back the very protections meant to ensure that revolution is equitable. This contradiction is not ideological; it’s economic: alienating a demographic with $1.7 trillion in annual buying power. When you remove the diverse talent capable of spotting bias, and the compliance officers capable of reporting it, you guarantee that your AI products will be flawed, biased, and ultimately, litigated. To reverse this erosion of value, executives must stop viewing labor as a cost to be minimized and start viewing work design as the primary investment vehicle for AI success. AI governance must move from the server room to the Boardroom. Boards must include members with the technical literacy to challenge management on model stability and data quality. We must recognize that responsible AI unlocks value and accelerates development by ensuring reliability. We must shift our strategy from automation (replacing heads) to augmentation (increasing value). Data shows that job numbers actually grow in AI-exposed fields when companies focus on augmentation. This requires a massive investment in skilling, specifically targeting the non-degree holders who are 3.5 times more likely to lose their jobs. Finally, we must embed intersectional equity into the core business strategy. This means using advanced analytics to monitor the talent lifecycle and ensure that restructuring efforts do not decimate the diversity pipeline. It means recognizing that the $12 trillion global economic opportunity of gender equity is only accessible if we actively retain women in the workforce. The 1.17 million layoffs of 2025 represent a fork in the road. One path leads to a hollowed-out future: a short-term spike in cash flow followed by a long-term decline in innovation, a rise in algorithmic liability, and a workforce paralyzed by fear. The other path recognizes that in the age of AI, humanity is the premium asset. It acknowledges that the only way to capture the exponential ROI of automation is to pair it with a diverse, resilient, and empowered human workforce. You can cut your way to a quarterly profit, but you cannot cut your way to the future. True productivity requires us to stop subtracting humans and start solving for the convergence of equity, economics, and engineering.

Title: US jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 last week as layoffs remain low

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Last week, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said.

Title: Dead Space creator Glen Schofield calls EA & Activision’s post‑acquisition era “bittersweet”

Glen Schofield has been on a roll with insights that are making waves in the video game industry of late. Known as the founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, Schofield opened up a can of worms when he detailed the “bittersweet” transformation of video game publishing juggernauts, Electronic Arts and Activision. Schofield spearheaded Dead Space at EA in 2008 and worked on its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, before departing from Striking Distance earlier in 2023. In the LinkedIn post, he looked back on his decade-long tenure at both companies during their heydays. After the word came out about EA’s pivot into private ownership by Saudi Arabia’s PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal, similar to Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard Acquisition, Schofield finally chimed in on the conversation on LinkedIn. Schofield drew parallels between the two companies and said, “In the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras.” Schofield expressed emotional turmoil, reflecting on his career at both studios, adding: I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes. Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected. It’s not without reason that Schofield viewed EA and Activision as crucibles for talent. He further detailed: EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense, no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood. Activision was a different playing field, he said, stating it was: Where review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another. However, the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal, and somehow, the time felt well spent. Schofield went down nostalgia lane, stating that both companies honed and bred a new generation of developers, but that time seems short-lived in light of recent acquisitions. He concluded the interview, stating: It’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. Mine included. His comments come at a time when the industry as a whole is reeling from a series of layoffs as AI becomes a more prominent feature in titles, and game publishers and developers alike continue to chase profitability amid rising costs and increased competition. They provide unique insight into how developers view two of the most iconic game publishers in the industry, even amid continued volatility.

U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market WASHINGTON -- U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Last week, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department's report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announces departure of AI exec Rohit Prasad in leadership shakeup

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dropped an AI bombshell on employees today, announcing that Rohit Prasad—who has led Amazon’s so-called AGI (artificial general intelligence) team since 2023, overseeing the development of the company’s Nova models—will depart at the end of the year. Prasad previously served as the head scientist behind Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, a role he held from the product’s earliest days. When he was appointed to lead the new ambitious AGI effort after ChatGPT launched in November 2022, as part of a scramble to develop a competitive LLM that could help reinvigorate the Alexa voice assistant, it was led almost entirely by ex–Alexa executives. In a blog post, Jassy announced that longtime Amazon Web Services (AWS) executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new organization that drives the development of its AI models, custom computer chips (which include its Graviton, Trainium, and Nitro chips), and quantum computing efforts. DeSantis has overseen the many teams designing AWS’s global infrastructure. “With our Nova 2 models just launched at Re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote, adding that DeSantis would report directly to him.Jassy also said that as part of the organizational change, Pieter Abbeel, an Amazon Distinguished Scientist in robotics who is also an AI and robotics professor at UC Berkeley, will lead the company’s frontier model research team. Abbeel came to Amazon in 2024 along with other cofounders of his robotics startup Covariant, in a deal that also saw Amazon licensing Covariant’s software, which included AI models that gave robots the ability to quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. “Pieter is one of the world’s leading AI researchers and cofounder of Covariant, which pioneered the first commercial foundation model for robotics,” Jassy wrote. “His deep expertise in generative AI and reinforcement learning makes him well-suited to advance Amazon’s AI research as we push the boundaries of what’s possible for customers.” The news of Prasad’s departure comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that he was recently at Amazon’s Re:Invent conference discussing the latest Nova models. However, over the past two years there has been significant media coverage suggesting that Amazon’s Alexa AI and AGI-related efforts have struggled and fallen behind competitors. A year ago, for example, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey reported exclusively that leaked Amazon documents identified critical flaws in the delayed AI reboot of Alexa. And in June 2024, Fortune reported that Amazon had blown Alexa’s shot to dominate AI, according to more than a dozen employees who worked on it—partly owing to a lack of adequate data, even though Prasad pushed the AGI team to work harder and harder, with a message to “get some magic” out of the LLM. In addition, last week’s Amazon layoffs fueled concerns about whether Amazon was still lagging behind in AI, and whether the cuts reflected slowing growth. That came on the heels of comments in October by analyst Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, who said Amazon’s AWS was in “last place” in the AI cloud race. However, The Information as well as Bloomberg reported this week that Amazon was in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI, in turn, had agreed to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips, perhaps helping counter the narrative that the company is behind in AI. OpenAI had previously agreed to spend $38 billion using AWS for computing.Amazon also has a deal with AI company Anthropic, in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. Anthropic has agreed to use AWS’s Trainium chips for training, and Anthropic’s Claude model is being used to answer some queries in the new Alexa Plus.

Title: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are awarding $5 million to a leader in neurodiversity education

By JAMES POLLARD NEW YORK (AP) — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said.

Title: The Trade Desk Lays Off Staff One Year After Its Last Major Reorg

The Trade Desk is cutting its workforce. A company spokesperson confirmed the news with AdExchanger. The layoffs affect less than 1% of the company. The Trade Desk’s current headcount is approximately 3,900. TTD is hosting an all-hands meeting at 12:30 pm eastern to go over the news with remaining employees. In a statement, a spokesperson from The Trade Desk noted that TTD has hired nearly 1,000 people this year, including “dozens” at the senior leadership level. Still, there have been several recent notable departures, including Jud Spencer, who was a lead engineer at TTD for more than 12 years. He left in November. Tuesday’s reorg “is part of our mission to constantly ensure we have the right skills and experiences in place to drive innovation and value for the world’s biggest advertisers in what is a fast-evolving ad tech environment,” the TTD spokesperson said. “And as part of that, a handful of folks are moving on from The Trade Desk.” The restructuring comes almost exactly one year after The Trade Desk underwent what CEO Jeff Green described as “the biggest reorganization” in the company’s history. That reorg, which took place last December, involved restructuring TTD’s client-facing teams, Green told investors in February during the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call. He said this shift was designed to improve how TTD serves advertisers and agencies. That disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report – which included TTD’s first-ever earnings miss – marked the start of a turbulent year for The Trade Desk, including growing pressure from Amazon and Google, its main rivals in the DSP market. During that call, Green acknowledged short-term disruptions caused by the reorg, but said it was necessary to position TTD for efficiency and growth. The layoffs on Tuesday suggest TTD is still adjusting to those changes as it works to balance efficiency with expansion heading into 2026. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. This most recent restructuring also lands amid heightened scrutiny of programmatic supply chains following industry debates – instigated by TTD – about reseller transparency. The Trade Desk has positioned itself as a vocal proponent of greater accountability for advertisers across the open web, but its stance – and the release of OpenAds, its forked version of Prebid’s wrapper – have introduced new friction points between TTD and sell-side platforms. At the same time, The Trade Desk is still leaning into Kokai, the AI-powered update to its media buying platform, which launched in 2023. Despite operational growing plans, Kokai remains central to TTD’s long-term strategy as it continues to face intensifying competition from Amazon and mounting investor pressure to prove that its AI investments can drive meaningful growth.

Since early 2022, just before widespread AI-hype, U.S. job-openings as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have fallen from roughly 12.1 million to about 7.7 million, a decline of approximately 36%. Over the same period, the S&P 500’s total return (price plus dividends) is roughly 48%, reflecting strong equity markets. Conventional wisdom would tell you a booming stock market should create more jobs, not fewer. But it’s hard to ignore that there are larger forces at play, and a potential harbinger of how companies are starting to view their workforces. According to a new report from the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp), 2026 will be the year that large companies stop treating AI merely as a productivity tool and start wielding it as a strategic lever for workforce restructuring. That’s a far cry from the typical corporate talking points. How many times have we heard executives tout AI as a thought partner, a collaborator, a productivity accelerator? Or as a catalyst for upskilling and repurposing people? And yet, we’re already seeing evidence of this trend. In 2025 alone, UPS cut 48,000, Amazon eliminated 14,000 jobs, and Verizon announced plans to lay off 15,000 employees. The reason for all these cuts? While restructuring, the need for different skills, and business optimization are all frequently cited, increasingly AI is as well. In fact, a World Economic Forum survey found 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of AI. Reduction doesn’t just mean layoffs; AI is also being used as a reason hiring has slowed in many companies. Of course, not all layoffs or hiring slowdowns will be AI-driven. Some of these changes reflect broader economic “cooling” after the post-COVID hiring boom. Other layoffs are designed to instill more agility in workforces, with some prominent CEOs such as Amazon’s Andy Jassy saying as much. But workers should adjust their expectations and recognize that some companies aren’t fretting about whether or not their employees can adapt to AI. Instead they’re using layoffs as a way to accelerate that adaption. Using AI-driven layoffs as a strategic lever dovetails with three other trends i4cp sees emerging or strengthening in 2026. The first is the need for organizations to be more skills-based. i4cp research shows that companies with high “skills readiness,” or the confidence that their workforce has the skills needed for the next three years, are 12 times more likely to offer upskilling to employees. They are also six times more likely to have cataloged the skills and capabilities of their workforces, and are six times more likely to determine which tasks are best performed by humans versus AI, and vice versa. For decades companies have asked “How many employees do we need?” Instead, high-performing organizations are increasingly asking, “What work needs to be done and who (or what) has the capabilities to do it?” Already, companies like Target and Dow are using custom GPT tools and AI-powered interview guides to help managers connect skills data to business decisions in real time. The path is clear: skills will be the shared language connecting business strategy, tech and talent. In addition to upskilling efforts, i4cp also expects that by the end of 2026, it won’t be uncommon for some professionals to have a personal AI “work twin,” or a digital counterpart trained on their workflows, communication styles and task patterns. While this evolution won’t happen overnight and still seems somewhat in the realm of science fiction, high-performing companies are already realizing that AI isn’t just a tool, but a teammate. Such collaboration will bring new management concerns, such as, “When an employee leaves, does the twin remain?” Or “How do we measure productivity when part of the workforce never sleeps?” This leap in digital work twins will require new governance, new leadership development programs and new mindsets. Best-in-class companies will treat the AI-human relationship as a trust partnership, experimenting with what work is best suited for AI agents versus humans. While twins obviously can be a significant productivity multiplier, companies will need to ensure that doesn’t happen at the expense of organizational culture. All of this shifting also means that leading companies will have more fluid, modular workforces, with systems in place that can match emerging work needs with available capabilities. This will require managers and HR leaders to continuously shape and redeploy teams (of both humans and digital contributors), akin to managing a supply chain rather than a static roster. The organizations that thrive next year and beyond will embrace fluid workforces, treat skills as the company operating system, and work with AI as a trusted collaborator. The defining factor for success will ultimately be which firms navigate this transformation without sacrificing the human elements that ultimately drive growth and innovation.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. Other award winners announced Wednesday include Ilana Walder-Biesanz of National Math Stars, which supports young mathematicians, and Richard Rusczyk of The Mathcounts Foundation, which provides engaging math programs to middle school students. Kara Ball from Understood.org, a nonprofit that, like the Neurodiversity Alliance, supports those with learning differences including ADHD and dyslexia also received a $5 million award. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said. __ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: Bernie Sanders calls for halt on AI data center construction — wants to ensure that the technology benefits ‘all of us, not just the 1%’

"Is that the kind of future you want?" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said that he will push for a moratorium on the construction of AI data centers to ensure that the technology will be useful for the greatest number of Americans and not just the few multi-billionaires who are advocating for the widespread use of artificial intelligence. According to the senator’s X post, this delay “will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%.” Sanders raised three points in his short video: ‘Who is aggressively pushing AI?’; ‘What will AI and robotics mean economically for the working class of this country?’; and ‘Millions of kids in this country are becoming more and more isolated from real human relationships and are getting their emotional support from AI.’ I will be pushing for a moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop & deploy AI.The moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%. pic.twitter.com/PoV5ziA4oQDecember 16, 2025 The current AI build-out is largely driven by big tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Oracle, and Meta, among others. With trillions of dollars being poured into the infrastructure required to support artificial intelligence, many experts are warning that it’s becoming unsustainable and that we are already in an AI bubble. Aside from this, Microsoft’s push for Copilot+ AI PCs did not deliver the sales it was expecting, with most consumers simply purchasing AI PCs because there’s no other option when upgrading from Windows 10. There have also been concerns about AI replacing people in the workforce. While this hasn’t resulted in widespread layoffs yet, MIT estimates that AI could replace up to 11.7% of American workers across industries, not just in tech. Even Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that the widespread use of this technology could result in up to 20% unemployment within the next five years, with Ford CEO Jim Farley warning that it will wipe out nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Sanders also raised concerns about children using AI for companionship instead of building relationships with other people. “Think for a moment about a future when human beings are not interacting with each other and are spending virtually all of their time with devices instead of people,” Sanders said. “Is that the kind of future you want? Well, not me.” The senator from Vermont wants to halt all progress on AI data center construction to address these issues first. He also isn’t the only one concerned about the possible negative impacts of artificial intelligence on society, as Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other Democrat senators recently sent letters recently to several big tech companies asking them to explain how their AI data centers are impacting residential energy bills. These moves directly contradict the current administration’s goal of turning the U.S. into an AI powerhouse, with Trump signing an executive order for the so-called ‘Genesis Mission’ — an initiative to drive AI development across the country — and is even comparing its scale with the Manhattan Project.

Title: The ugly truth at the heart of America's miserable job market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates. ChatGPT isn't one of them. "There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet," Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, "The economy is paralyzed." The labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the "flattening" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary. Given the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're "all in on AI," often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble. But, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck. If you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell. There is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called "Scariest Chart in the World." The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street. As chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI "for every task possible," Microsoft is "rethinking" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots. But is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not. Ajilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is "overblown." Many companies are "using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient," he said, "With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners." He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI "is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet." There's also an important piece of context missing from "The Scariest Chart in the World": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates. When interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees. It's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end. This sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference "modest to strong" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that "Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity," another said "labor demand weakened overall," pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown. Corporate America began to lean into "efficiency" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue. The trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors "reduced hiring plans" and were "rightsizing" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, "uncertainty" and "tariffs" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls. But saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable. "I think that what's happening is just simple economics," she said, adding, "But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI." Each recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete. "I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think," said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. "There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable," he said. "But it won't be cataclysmic." The job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit. Despite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully. A pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, "Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs." Declining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's "efficiency" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers. Economists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate. Allie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments.

Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments. Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are "adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies." The company claims to be going "well beyond industry benchmarks" in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it's offering. An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don't land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000. One employee told Bloomberg that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks. Amazon said in October it would cut 14,000 jobs from its global workforce amid its deepening embrace of AI. It was reported that same month that the company's plans to ramp up its robotics operations could put around half a million jobs in the US at risk.

By Eddie Makuch on December 16, 2025 at 6:49AM PST Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft. He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield. Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle." "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said. Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs." March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles. The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company, including at its gaming division. Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: How the experts predict digital ad spend will pan out in 2026

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → U.S. advertising spending is now forecast to grow 6.6% next year — that’s not taking into account political ad spend that occurred in 2025 — down from an estimated 11% in the past 12 months, according to the latest analysis from Madison & Wall. The findings are reflected in a similar global forecast from media consultancy Ebiquity, which found that almost half (48%) of marketers expect to increase their media spend next year, with digital video and CTV likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, sources predict this moderate growth is most likely to be concentrated in a few hands, with the titans of Silicon Valley on course to benefit most from this trend. Per Madison & Wall’s revised assessment, programmatic spend follows stronger-than-expected performance in 2025 and reflects a moderation in growth rather than a downturn. For programmatic advertising, the forecast points to continued expansion in automated buying, concentrated in digital formats that deliver measurable performance, while much of the open internet — that includes independent ad tech — is under intense pressure to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. The upgrade comes after another strong quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% year over year in Q3 2025, excluding political spending, the fastest quarterly pace since early 2022 (see chart). Digital advertising increased 21%, raising digital’s share of total ad spend to 72%, with the forecast underscoring the continued dominance of channels with first-party data, closed-loop measurement, and AI-driven optimization. Looking ahead, Madison & Wall expects economic conditions to remain broadly supportive in 2026, despite rising policy and geopolitical risks. Consensus forecasts point to real GDP growth of roughly 1.8% and inflation near 2.8%, implying nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5%. While the correlation between economic growth and advertising has weakened, the firm views nominal growth as a meaningful reference point for advertising demand. It expects advertising growth to slow gradually rather than correct sharply. Within that environment, programmatic advertising is expected to increase its share of open internet transactions. Madison & Wall forecasts programmatic revenues across the open internet to grow 4.4% in 2026, with programmatic accounting for 74% of open internet ad revenues. Growth is expected to be driven by programmatic connected TV, digital out-of-home, and digital audio, each projected to grow at double-digit rates as automation expands across newer digital formats. However, total open internet advertising revenues are expected to be roughly flat. Programmatic growth in 2026 is therefore driven primarily by a shift in buying methods rather than an expansion of overall spend. Programmatic revenues tied to digital platforms and publishers are expected to decline slightly, reflecting ongoing pricing pressure and uneven demand outside large-scale platforms. In his end-of-year assessment, W Media Research‘s Karsten Weide remarked how much of the ad tech ecosystem on the open internet was in open conflict, highlighting how the Q3 dispute of transaction IDs, or “TIDs,” between buy- and sell-side players is an open wound. “What once sounded like a technical dispute over wrappers and auction mechanics has escalated into a power struggle over who governs the open internet,” he noted. By contrast, closed digital platforms are expected to continue to capture a disproportionate share of incremental spending. Madison & Wall forecasts commerce media to grow 16% in 2026, social media 15%, and search 8%. The firm expects ad tech platforms to introduce additional AI-powered buying tools designed to replicate the automated, outcome-focused buying models already prevalent within walled gardens. Madison & Wall further noted how advertisers are placing greater emphasis on price and performance, often at the expense of transparency and control, with spend increasingly directed toward platforms that bundle creative, optimization, and measurement within the cost of inventory. Direct relationships between advertisers and large media owners continue to expand; this is a trend that reduces reliance on agency-managed buying systems, with Madison & Wall expecting AI to enhance this trend as more workflow tools are made available in the industry. Meanwhile, search and commerce advertising are expected to remain structurally resilient, while publishers across the open internet face greater pressure to adapt their business models. In that context, programmatic advertising continues to function as a core transaction layer — growing in importance, but operating within a more constrained overall market. “If I have the opportunity to leave, I’m leaving. Omnicom is NOT competitive in my eyes. Their benefits suck and they are moving away from creative driven [sic] work and focusing on data driven [sic] work and pumping out as much content as possible.” — An Omnicom staff member speaks truth to power on the gift that keeps on giving, i.e., the OmnicomIPGmerger subreddit, while others use other threads to estimate that the layoffs are not even halfway done. From the 2026 Integral Ad Science Industry Pulse Report: WPP estimates commerce media spending to overtake TV this year The company’s latest global ad spend forecasts predict that commerce media will account for 15.6% of global ad spend in 2025, compared with the 14.6% spent on linear and connected TV. The case against AI agents for programmatic ad buying Christopher Francia, director of product development and client performance at Attention Arc explains discusses whether or not AI agents be involved in programmatic ad buys. Plot spoiler: “We’re not trusting that to large language model-based agents.” Google tells advertisers it’ll bring ads to Gemini in 2026 Google has said to advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its AI chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations, according to Adweek’s Trishla Ostwal. AI brings MFA to social media… how advertisers can avoid it Zefr CEO Rich Raddon argues that generative AI has led to the re-emergence of an unwelcome visitor from the past for most advertisers. X shuts down EU’s ad account after first major DSA fine The European Commission issued a €120 million fine to X — its first fine issued under the Digital Services Act (DSA) following prior allegations. Following the fine and a public response from X CEO Elon Musk, X shut down the Commission’s ad account. Advertiser battles Google, alleges failure to disclose queries “Google prioritizes profit over integrity by using its Google Ads program to deceive its customers, primarily small businesses, out of their hard-earned money,” the advertiser argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Case Pitts in San Jose. “Since 2020, Google has accomplished this grift, by hiding a significant portion of its client charges inside an impenetrable ‘black box’ that not even Houdini could open.” OpenPath offers buyers a “cleaner” route to publishers, but some are concerned about lack of clarity over indirect costs. Over the past year, Roblox has become harder for brands to ignore — not because it has resolved the challenges of digital commerce, but because of the scale at which younger consumers already use it. Corporate development sources estimate the deal valuation to be above $300 million, claiming tvScientific’s gross revenue is approximately $100 million.
