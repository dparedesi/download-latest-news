ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. No matter how you start your early morning routines, if you want to be productive and successful, ... More career experts say you should include these five things. A recent TikTok video by @ashtonhallofficial went viral amassing a staggering 109.2 million views. The video showed the creator’s time-stamped morning routine, starting as early as three a.m. The video gained traction as viewers wonder how realistic the routine is for success. After seeing the video, career experts at resume.io decided to offer tips on how five must-haves in your morning routine guarantee career success and boost productivity throughout your workday. On some days, given the daily obstacles many of us face in our jobs, it can feel more productive to hit the alarm, roll over and go back to sleep--especially with threats of inflation, AI competition and massive layoffs. But then reality hits, reminding you that you have to future-proof your job so you don’t end up another statistic. But have you ever been curious about how the rich and famous, with less to lose, start their early mornings? The career experts at resume.io compiled the morning routines of successful CEO billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook to show they start their morning routines for continued successful workdays. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and worth $202 billion, awakens around 6:30 a.m., according to resume.io and enjoys a screen-free start to his workday. The career experts describe his mornings as slow with family breakfasts and journaling before bracing the workday. They conclude that Bezos’ slow and balanced morning routine proves that productivity doesn’t always require rushing. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is worth $188.1 billion. Career experts tell us that he starts his day at eight a.m., checking numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. “Zuckerberg is known for his minimalistic morning routine, including wearing the same style of outfit daily to avoid decision fatigue,” they note. “This habit is also synonymous with other successful people like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, worth $2.4 billion, is one of the earliest risers in the business world, according to the career experts. He starts his day between 3:45 a.m. “This may be what inspired TikTok creator @ashtonhallofficial to do the same,” the experts speculate. “Cook uses the early hours to get ahead on emails and current affairs. He also often completes a workout before 6 a.m. Cook credits his structured early starts with helping him stay focused throughout the workday.” You may have already realized that the difference in you and the billionaires is that they have the freedom of going to bed and getting up when they choose. Many of us in the workforce don’t have the luxury of when to hit the hay or awaken in the morning. But research informs us that routines and rituals help with self-regulation and job stress, contributing to productivity and career success. So, it’s important to consider a structured morning to get your workday off on the right foot. Amanda Augustine, career expert for resume.io, explains that you don’t need to wake up at 3 a.m. to be successful. She advises that the key to having a productive morning depends on three factors: consistency, balance and starting the day off on your own terms. Here are Augustine’s habits that can be integrated into a morning routine that guarantees career success. 1. Aim to wake up at a consistent time. “Try waking up around the same time each day to help regulate your body’s natural rhythm,” Augustine suggests. “Over time, your body will learn when it’s time to be alert, helping you avoid grogginess and feel more energized in the morning.” 2. Limit phone use for the first 30-60 minutes. “Resist the urge to jump into emails or scroll through social media—even if it’s what some famous CEOs swear by,” she advises. “Giving yourself some screen-free time in the morning can lower stress levels and help you start your day calmly and with intention, rather than reacting to the noise around you.” 3. Soak in some natural light. Augustine recommends exposing yourself to natural light within the first hour of waking up. “Whether it’s stepping outside or opening the blinds, this simple habit helps reset your internal clock, lifts your mood and supports better sleep at night.” 4. Move your body. “Incorporating movement into your morning—whether it’s stretching, walking or a quick workout—can get your blood flowing, improve your focus, and boost your mood for the rest of the day,” she points out. 5. Set your intentions for the day. “Take a few minutes each morning to jot down your top one-to-three priorities for the day.” According to Augustine, this helps bring clarity to your morning and ensures you’re starting with purpose instead of just jumping into the next thing. "Remember, the key is to build a morning routine that suits your lifestyle. This will make it easier to maintain and more effective in setting you up for long-term success,” she concludes. These five must-haves in your morning routine corroborate studies that show morning contemplation broadens your perspective and reverses negative thoughts such as self-doubt and uncertainty about the future. Whatever you plant in your mind in the early morning will continue to live and breathe within as you face the challenges in the workdays ahead.

Title: The Decline of Outside Magazine Is Also the End of a Vision of the Mountain West

Four years ago, Robin Thurston, a new owner of Outside, hosted an introductory meeting with the staff of the magazine. Thurston, a tech entrepreneur and a former semi-professional cyclist, Zoomed in from Boulder, where he lives. Much of the staff gathered in the magazine’s offices, in downtown Santa Fe, eager for a glimpse of their new boss. The feeling in the room was hopeful. Like many media products, the magazine had been struggling. The thick print issues of the nineties, fat with ads for Patagonia and Land Rover, had become notably slimmer. Some employees had been furloughed to cut down on costs, and Outside had developed a reputation for not paying freelancers in a timely manner. But it was still publishing award-winning journalism, and had a solid reputation founded on decades of literary and investigative journalism. Around the industry, investors were buying distressed media companies; as far as new owners went, Thurston seemed like a good fit, the kind of guy who was happy to have a meeting that was also a bike ride—if you could keep up with him. “The guy’s a hammer,” one staffer told me. Thurston had sold his first company, MapMyFitness, to Under Armour, in 2013. By the time he purchased Outside, he had already raised more than a hundred and fifty million dollars from venture-capital firms, including Sequoia Heritage, to create a digital hub for the outdoors. He had bought roughly a dozen titles—Backpacker, SKI, Climbing, and Yoga Journal among them—under the umbrella of Pocket Outdoor Media. Outside, the largest in circulation and in prestige, could be the centerpiece. Thurston told the staff that he was changing the name of the company from Pocket Outdoor Media to Outside Interactive, Inc. It was an encouraging step, one that felt like a true commitment. In February, however, Outside, Inc., announced its third round of layoffs in as many years. Nearly the entire Outside editorial team that was in place at the time of the acquisition has now left, transitioned to non-editorial roles, or been laid off. A handful of full-time staffers edit the website; the print magazine, once a monthly but now a quarterly, has just one full-time dedicated editor. In response to the latest layoffs, a group of thirty-six contributing editors, writers, and photographers—including Tim Cahill, E. Jean Carroll, Ian Frazier, Hampton Sides, and Jimmy Chin—signed a letter requesting that their names be removed from the masthead. Some of the signatories had been around for Outside’s seventeen-year run of National Magazine Award nominations (including three consecutive wins for General Excellence), and the publication of stories that became best-selling books, including “The Perfect Storm” and “Into Thin Air,” and movies, including “Blue Crush.” “Your company now seems intent on destroying what Outside once stood for,” the group wrote in an e-mail, on March 10th. (I have written a handful of pieces for Outside’s website, the most recent of which was published in 2019.) “There is this magazine—or there was this magazine—that was a liberating thing, that had a history, and there were all these people who just cared. They really cared so much about it,” Sides told me. In response, Thurston reiterated the company’s “commitment to meaningful storytelling” amid a “changing media landscape” and “substantial headwinds in the media market that impact advertising, subscription, and e-commerce.” But, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former editors, writers, and executives, most of whom requested anonymity—either because they had signed non-disparagement agreements or they feared retaliation—mismanagement and a number of missteps have made a challenging situation worse. “I think there was a fundamental lack of direction or understanding from the C-suite as to what any of these magazines were, why the audiences cared about them or subscribed, and what it takes to tell a good story,” a former employee told me. (Outside, Inc., disputes a number of characterizations in this article, including the idea that in-depth reporting—which a representative claimed “remains fundamental”—is no longer a priority.) Outside was founded, in 1977, by Jann Wenner, who brought on collaborators who had worked with him at Rolling Stone, which he had co-founded ten years previously; they hoped to capitalize on the growing interest in outdoor activities and adventure travel. At the time, there were other publications focussed on the outdoors—Field & Stream had a circulation of nearly two million—but they tended to be either technical and insidery or scandalous and tabloidy. David Quammen, a prominent contributor to Outside, recalled Cahill, a founding editor, referring to the latter as “Jaguars rip my flesh” stories. The magazine saw itself as literary but not self-serious; if the stereotypical National Geographic story was a walk through the jungle recounted in hushed, awed tones, its Outside equivalent was a little dustier, wilder, and less reverent. “Outside always had the feeling that it was apart from the Washington and New York journalism community—it’s there in the name. It was always westward-leaning—you know, getting outside, getting away from big cities, living your life, environmentalism and conservation,” Sides said. “There was always a contrarian aspect to it.” In 1978, Wenner sold the magazine to Larry Burke, a young man from Chicago who had spent a chunk of his twenties vagabonding around Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Burke eventually moved the magazine’s headquarters from Chicago to Santa Fe, where staffers worked out of an adobe-style building with two wood-burning fireplaces and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The magazine’s remit was broad: writers covered mountaineering and triathletes, rodeo queens and road trips. Outside sent Susan Orlean to Spain to meet with a female matador, and Don Katz to Yorkshire to profile a man who held the world record for keeping a ferret in his pants the longest. Quammen, who wrote Outside’s natural-science column for fifteen years, told me, “I would write an essay about something really kind of fringe, like, What’s the sense of identity of a spoon worm? What are the redeeming merits of a mosquito? You know, various weird shit. And the editors, God bless them, would print the stuff.” Mark Bryant was Outside’s editor-in-chief in the nineties, years that seem golden mostly in retrospect. “The business was hard, the work was hard, but it was more straightforward,” Bryant told me. “We could focus on the business at hand, putting out a great magazine for readers, and not, you know, content bundling and data aggregation.” Baby boomers were discovering an apparently bottomless appetite for outdoor sports and adventure travel. The magazine benefitted from this surge in interest, even as some writers expressed misgivings about it. The article that became “Into Thin Air” was an example of this ambivalence. Bryant assigned Jon Krakauer to cover the rapid commercialization of Mt. Everest expeditions, sending him on a trip led by a guide who had agreed to accept the bulk of his fee in the form of future advertising in the magazine. That guide, Rob Hall, ended up dying on the mountain, along with seven other people. Krakauer, traumatized and exhausted, wrote a seventeen-thousand-word article within weeks. The story was memorably clear on the dangers that accompanied the increasing numbers of amateurs on Mt. Everest; the next year, demand for guided trips was higher than ever. Burke, the owner, was often a source of friction. According to former staffers, he was critical of hippies, dirtbag climbers, environmentalists, and stories about animals. But he was also immensely proud of the magazine. During the nineties, the famously stingy Burke rewarded star writers and editors with all-expenses-paid kayaking trips on the Salmon River. Through the years, Burke received multiple offers to sell Outside, but he was always resistant, even as the rise of the internet began to erode circulation and advertising income. At first, the larger audiences available online, especially through social media, made the trade-offs seem worthwhile. “We in the outdoor media—and the media, generally—were kind of selling our souls to the platforms for the distribution, because it was so easy and so cheap,” Christopher Jerard, an original staff member of Freeskier magazine and the current vice-president of marketing at Outside, Inc., said. “Then—surprise, surprise—they turned the spigot off, and we were left with no owned audiences.” By 2020, a person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission estimated, the print edition of the magazine had roughly half as many pages as a few decades earlier; Burke, nearing his eighties, finally decided to sell. When Pocket Outdoor Media began scooping up titles, many of them were still profitable or breaking even, with committed but declining audiences, according to sources familiar with the acquisitions. But Thurston seemed to have bigger ambitions than running a stable of small magazines that more or less broke even. In his initial meeting, he laid out a vision of Outside, Inc., as a tech-media empire, “the Amazon Prime for the active-life-style participant,” with subscription numbers akin to those of Disney+ or Netflix. Rather than depending on the volatile advertising market, the company would get recurring revenue via a membership program, Outside+, which would provide unlimited access to the magazines’ articles and other perks. Thurston has bought up non-media brands, including Gaia, a mapping app; FinisherPix, a photography service; Inntopia, a travel-booking software; and Trailforks, a trail database. (Last year, Thurston also reacquired MapMyFitness, his first company, from Under Armour.) He estimated that the worldwide audience interested in healthy, active life styles was at least a billion people, and argued that the industry was recession-proof. In the first, flush year of Outside, Inc., the company “was acting like a startup, and spending money like a startup,” a former executive told me. It occupied a new, spacious headquarters, on Pearl Street, Boulder’s main drag. Thurston liked to dream big—instead of, say, fifteen Outside, Inc., podcasts, why not a hundred? After years of operating on a shoestring budget, the abundance felt like a relief. The company implemented diversity goals, cleared years of freelancer debt, and committed to becoming carbon-neutral within five years. Amid an atmosphere of near-zero interest rates, venture-capital investors were drawn to grand plans and messianic visions, both of which Thurston was skilled at providing. If the company could convert ten per cent of the brand’s existing audiences into subscribers, he theorized, that would amount to twenty million members. (By comparison, the Times has nearly eleven million digital subscribers.) That goal was ambitious, Thurston conceded during his initial meeting with Outside staffers, but he did expect that, within four or five years, Outside, Inc., would be making three hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue from digital subscriptions alone. (That’s more than the Washington Post and The Atlantic made, combined, in 2024.) When I spoke to Thurston last month, he reminded me that the world was plagued by chronic disease, a loneliness epidemic, and generalized alienation. “I have a fundamental belief, Rachel, that the outdoors can solve many of these problems,” he told me. “I fundamentally feel like, if we can achieve that at scale, it can have a big impact on what’s happening in the world.” Thurston saw the media brands he acquired as the top of a content funnel, the “first touchpoint with the ecosystem,” as he put it. But, from early on, writing was an uneasy fit with the business plan. “You cannot get a return on a hundred and fifty million dollars from niche media,” Caley Fretz, the former editor of CyclingTips, which Outside, Inc., acquired in 2021, told me. “Once you’ve got Sequoia [Heritage] on board, the incentive is for just an insane level of scale, and the media entities were immediately superfluous. The audiences they had weren’t sizable enough, and the structures they operated under were not scalable. It became very obvious that the traditional journalism and editorial focus was going to have to give way.” According to Thurston, a significant amount of Outside, Inc.,’s daily engagement has been on the mapping apps. In 2022, the company went through two rounds of layoffs and ceased print publications of nearly all of its titles, apart from Outside. Outside had built its reputation on investigations and reported essays, and at first it continued to publish these kinds of stories, both in print and online. Sources said that long-form stories got good traffic, as did deeply reported service pieces, like detailed gear reviews. But in-depth reporting seemed to be less of a priority for Thurston, according to former editorial staffers. (When I asked Thurston if there were stories from the old days of Outside that would fit his vision for the magazine, the only example he could name was the piece that became “Into Thin Air.” “Any that come to mind other than Krakauer?” I asked. There was a long, awkward pause, and then Thurston said that he would think about it.) “I think the crux of the problem is he’s running a media business and he fundamentally doesn’t love media,” Felix Magowan, the founder of Pocket Outdoor Media, said. Last January, Outside published an extensive investigation, by Annette McGivney, into a prominent California climber’s long history of violence and sexual assault. (Later that year, the climber was sentenced to life in prison, for three sexual assaults in Yosemite National Park.) Shortly afterward, editorial staffers were called into a meeting with Heather Dietrick, Outside’s new chief media officer, who had formerly worked at Gawker and the Daily Beast. Dietrick cited the story about the climber, saying that although it was praiseworthy it was an example of the kind of content that Outside should consider moving away from. The company’s mission was to inspire people to go outside; dark and depressing investigative reporting did the exact opposite. (A representative wrote that the magazine aims for “a healthy mix of uplifting, adventure-focused stories and thorough investigative journalism.”) Then, last fall, after a writer on assignment was photographed standing with Tim Walz, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, while wearing a Harris/Walz cap, higher-ups pushed for extra layers of oversight for political content in advance of the election. This contributed to a “chilling” effect, former staffers said. Thurston said that there was never any kind of ban on political content, and pointed to Outside’s coverage of staff cuts in national parks as an example, among others. But former staffers told the Columbia Journalism Review that stories perceived as political were “defanged” or significantly delayed. Thurston seemed caught off guard by the negative reaction on social media to the most recent layoffs, which he characterized as part of a necessary shift in strategy. “To me, it’s kind of, like, adapt or die for every media company,” he told me. A representative from the public-relations team working with the company sent me an article from the Times titled “The Gen X Career Meltdown,” the subhead of which read, “Just when they should be at their peak, experienced workers in creative fields find that their skills are all but obsolete.” “I think you have a lot of passionate and somewhat earnest people,” Michael Roberts, an Outside staffer since 2000 and the company’s current director of strategic initiatives, said. “I do think the nostalgia element of this is a big factor.” These days, he argued, maybe the best way to stoke enthusiasm and capture fleeting attention spans isn’t only through a long article but through a live event, a podcast, or a video. “I think about my own kid—like, is he ever going to read a story like that?” But sources familiar with the company’s operations, including former executives, say that the problems at Outside, Inc., can’t just be chalked up to a changing media landscape. Former employees described Thurston as quick to both embrace and abandon ideas, strong on vision but weak on execution. (For the past three years, the company has not had a chief operating officer.) The new ownership migrated the magazine’s website to a new platform. “We lost all our Google cred, and our traffic just tanked,” a person familiar with operations told me. As the new ownership focussed on its digital strategy, print subscriptions declined by more than seventy per cent, the person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission said. “The people there are just trying to hold on to this thing with their fingernails. On a human-to-human level, it makes you sad, because these are people who care about the outdoors and people who care about publishing, and every resource they have is being systematically dismantled,” a current contributor told me. The membership model hasn’t taken off as planned. Outside+ presently has fewer than a million paid subscribers, and a significant number of these have come via the company’s acquisitions rather than through organic growth. “It’s all been organic shrinkage, actually,” the former executive said. “Where I thought we would be four years ago . . .” Thurston said. “The last four years have not been easy.” In 2022, Outside, Inc., announced the Outerverse, which included an N.F.T. marketplace “committed to promoting wellness, diversity, and sustainability with the help of blockchain technology.” Editors and writers were encouraged to produce stories about the blockchain. When a writer at CyclingTips wrote a lightly skeptical take on N.F.T.s, it was quickly taken down. That June, the company celebrated the launch of the Outerverse with a rooftop Jack Johnson concert in New York. But the project was plagued with technical issues, and only a few hundred of the ten thousand N.F.T.s were sold. That fall, FTX collapsed, and the N.F.T. market cratered. The Outerverse quietly shut down. “It was just the wrong moment,” Thurston said. “But it hasn’t stopped us from taking swings at opportunities.” Even before last month’s layoffs, the optimism of the early post-acquisition months had given way to a grim feeling that Outside, Inc., was struggling, and that the legacy of the acquired media brands hung in the balance. Owing in part to the company’s belt-tightening efforts, Thurston sold Outside’s Santa Fe offices. Before its new owners took possession—they are reportedly transforming the building into a boutique hotel—the old guard convened a hasty goodbye party. The atmosphere, at once debauched and sombre, felt like a wake, one attendee said. Partygoers were given permission to clear out most of the remaining furnishings, including framed prints of famous issues and National Magazine Award statuettes. Speaking with former Outside staffers, I got the sense that their anger was, at least to some extent, a cover for dismay at a more diffuse and painful set of losses, as tech and finance have encroached on the Mountain West: the ski resorts bought up by private equity; the dirtbag climbers priced out of small towns; Bozeman, of all places, becoming the next tech hot spot. “It just seemed like, to a lot of us watching from afar, Is this the way people are now? Is this the way they live their life?” Sides said. Right now, the company’s focus is on the Outside Festival, in Denver, later this spring. More than eighteen thousand tickets were sold for last year’s inaugural event, which was pitched as a cross between TED, South by Southwest, and the Consumer Electronics Show. This year’s events will include bands, a climbing wall, gear booths, and a startup-pitch competition. When Thurston spoke about it, his voice brightened. “It’s not just about the magazine,” he said, sounding suddenly full of enthusiasm for the future. “It’s, like, What are all of these different avenues to inspire people to get outdoors?” ♦

IBM workers told to come back to the office When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. IBM has reportedly enacted a mass return-to-office policy, mandating US sales staff to work at least three days a week at a client site, flagship office or sales hub. The news comes just days after the company told its US Cloud employees to return to “strategic” locations (company offices) on similar three-day-per-week terms. In the case of IBM’s US Cloud workers, they’ve been given until July 1 to adhere to the new policy. Workers needing to relocate have been cut a little more slack, with until October 1 to find a new home. It’s unclear when the company’s sales staff will need to move by. On the face of it, IBM’s return-to-office policy is on the nicer side for those in favor of remote and hybrid working. Three days has long been the average in a post-pandemic world, however many of IBM’s fellow tech giants, including Amazon, have enacted full-time five-day policies, marking an end to remote working altogether. Across the US, IBM has five flagship offices in New York, Raleigh, Washington DC and San Francisco. The fifth, in Austin, will be open by next year. A further eight sales hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle are also available for in-person work. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! According to an internal memo by Adam Lawrence seen by The Register, Dallas-based Digital Sales workers will be relocated to the new Austin office when it opens in 2026. Lawrence billed the RTO move as a “return to client initiative,” suggesting that sales staff need to be closer to clients to secure sales. Casually referred to as an initialism for ‘I’ve Been Moved’, IBM has a long history of relocating workers, however positions have been relatively stable at the company in the grand scheme of things. Apart from around 1,000 layoffs in August 2024 relating to the closure of a China R&D department, IBM’s only other big job cut was in January 2023, when 3,900 lost their jobs. Only a handful of much smaller reductions have followed since then.

Title: The 2024 Top 100 Beauty Companies
URL: http://wwd.com/lists/top-beauty-companies-in-the-world-2024-1237087322/

WWD Beauty Inc's annual ranking of the world's largest beauty companies by sales. Speed and agility were the buzzwords of 2024, so it’s apropos that beauty sales broke the $250 billion barrier for the first time last year. But there are clouds on the horizon. What’s clear from the 2024 WWD Beauty Inc Top 100, our annual ranking of the world’s largest beauty companies by sales, is that the industry is undergoing seismic shifts as a result of geopolitical tensions, technological advances and a consumer landscape that is more complex than ever before. The good news is that total sales hit $252.09 billion. But that represented an increase of just 2.8 percent year-over-year, almost half that of 2023’s 5.3 percent gain. The ongoing slowdown in China weighed heavily on sales, and corporate restructuring was in the cards for a number of players as they sought to derisk and home in on high-potential categories. L’Oréal accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales, its share of the Top 100 inching up once more, by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, up from 14.7 percent in 2019. The top 10 companies overall generated sales of $147.49 billion, or 58.5 percent of total Top 100 revenues, down 0.9 percentage points. Despite the year’s challenges, the vast majority — 73 percent — of companies saw their sales increase, but only 29 saw double-digit gains, down from 37 a year earlier, a sign of slower growth on the market overall. Of the 17 players with negative sales progression, seven were down more than 10 percent and three posted declines of more than 20 percent. Among the biggest winners: Spain’s Puig entered the top 10 for the first time, up four places on a year ago, driven by strong growth in fragrance and skin care. L’Occitane, buoyed by the year’s viral hit Sol de Janeiro, climbed two places to number 18. While times were tough for a number of C-beauty players, the biggest Chinese company on the list, Proya, jumped eight spots to number 28, the first C-beauty firm to reach the Top 30 global beauty companies. With social-savvy affordable makeup players still trending as consumers feel the pinch, despite weakness in mass overall, especially in the U.S., beauty got two new billionaire brands, with E.l.f Beauty and Cosnova both surpassing that milestone in dollar terms. This year’s newcomers include D&G Beauty, which has seen its sales explode since it took its beauty license, previously held by Shiseido, back in-house; Chinese makeup artist brand Mao Geping, which went public in Hong Kong; Auréa Group, the new owner seeking to turn around The Body Shop; Shein, which is flying high with in-house brand Sheglam, and AS Beauty, which bought Bliss World from L Catterton and has successfully rejuvenated the Laura Geller makeup brand. But it was a rough ride for beauty on the stock market in 2024. Of the 49 listed players tracked in our By the Numbers section, only 15 saw their share prices increase through the year, with Victoria’s Secret & Co. the biggest gainer as the market reacted to its turnaround efforts. Of the 29 public players whose share value fell, 21 were down in the double digits, and five of the biggest decliners — Nu Skin Enterprises, Yunnan Botanee, Olaplex, The Estée Lauder Cos. and Shiseido — were already on the wane a year ago, with their market value falling further in 2024. The WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranks the world’s largest beauty manufacturers. Firms are arranged by their beauty sales for the 2024 calendar year. For those companies whose fiscal year did not run from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, estimates were calculated. All sales figures were either obtained from the companies or generated with the help of industry sources, indicated by (EST.) in the ranking. For this list, “beauty” includes fragrance, makeup, skin care, body care, sun care, hair care, deodorant, plus cellulite and shaving products. It does not include bar soaps, razors, toothpastes, food and diet foods, medicines, vitamins, detergents or appliances. The revenues only include sales of beauty products each firm owns or manufactures and do not include business from private-label lines produced for other brands or products distributed for other companies. Information in the main brands section reflects company holdings in 2024.

Title: 2024 Top 100: Growing Pains Hamper The Estée Lauder Cos.

From an about-face on Amazon to a reset C-suite, the company was largely flat year-over-year. Senior Editor, Beauty With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Other changes included Tracey T. Travis stepping down as CFO, replaced by Akhil Shrivastava. The changes continued into 2025 under de La Faverie’s leadership, with Peter Jueptner, Estée Lauder group president, international, leaving, followed by a plethora of moves to its international leadership. Related Articles Fragrance EXCLUSIVE: Kering Beauté Names New CEO at Creed Skin Care EXCLUSIVE: Estée Lauder Focuses on Beauty Rest With Appointment of First Global Sleep Adviser, Dr. Matthew Walker On the brand level, Jane Hertzmark Hudis will take on the new title of executive vice president, chief brand officer, reporting directly to de La Faverie. The company’s 24 brands will now be organized by category clusters reporting to Hudis, with the hope being that this will break down silos and accelerate speed-to-market innovations. Much of the leadership reshuffling involves the elevation of internal executives, many of whom had joined the company in the last few years. Last June, Frédéric Malle announced plans to leave his eponymous niche fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. As for the board, Ronald S. Lauder, a son of founder Estée, retired and handed one of his seats to his son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer, who is married to Aerin Lauder. Most recently, the company expanded the number of layoffs it needs to make from the 3,000 announced in 2024 to as many as 7,000 as part of its Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. It was also reported that Lauder had hired consultancy Evercore to assess its current brand portfolio, with continued speculation that it could look at divestments. Throughout 2024, weak demand in China and Asia travel retail continued to weigh on Lauder, while cracks started to appear in its home market. As a result, the company pulled its full year 2025 outlook in October due to continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As of press time, it had not issued a new one. While analysts believe some impactive factors are out of Lauder’s control, de La Faverie is betting on his Beauty Reimagined strategy to “restore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years,” he said in a release. Key to his vision is expanding into high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to participate in key growth opportunities in prestige beauty. Over the last nine months, for example, key brands like Estée Lauder, Clinique and The Ordinary have launched on Amazon, while in Europe, the company is eager to leverage the strength of its skin care category in the pharmacy channel, for one. Per the company, the move to Amazon appears to have been so far successful. As for launches, Balmain debuted Les Éternels de Balmain, a collection of eight fragrances, produced under license by the Estée Lauder Cos. Deciem, the incubator and parent company of The Ordinary — which closed its $1.7 billion deal with parent The Estée Lauder Cos. in 2024 — debuted Loopha, a body care brand with two products, hand and body washes. Other key launches included La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty’s Runway Lip Color, with the help of its first ever celebrity face, Angelina Jolie. Also during 2024, Clinique made a philanthropic commitment of $5 million over seven years to establish the Mount Sinai-Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Centre with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. It will study skin aging, skin allergies and inflammatory eczematous skin conditions. Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Title: FDA Approves Neuralink Rival’s Brain Implant
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/17/fda-approves-neuralink-rivals-brain-implant/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T17:34:17Z

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: You Know Who Else Really Hates Trump’s Tariffs? Hollywood

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Movies How Movie Studio Spies Size Up the Competition Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Title: Your Skills Could Be Worth Up To $5,000/Month—How To Cash In

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Many are sitting on a goldmine of skills and will retire, not realizing what they could have ... More achieved in their lifetime You’ve likely helped a college friend rewrite their resume, explained a process clearly to a co-worker, or simplified a tech tool when a family member just wasn’t getting it. You never charged for these services. But while you’re not charging…someone else is. Most people sit on skills that could easily be turned into an asset that makes them anywhere from $500, to $5,000, or even five figures a month. But, like you, they overlook them and write these skills off as normal, nothing special. Unfortunately, when finances are tight, the cost of living is up, layoffs are looming, and inflation creeps into everyday items like eggs or major purchases like buying a house--they’re stuck with no options when they had plenty of options, they could have utilized all along. Are you sitting on a goldmine of skills that could be the key to unlocking financial freedom and career satisfaction? Let’s find out. To begin with, we’ll conduct a self-audit. Answering these questions helps uncover potential hidden skills--skills which you’ve had for a long while and are inherent to your nature, but which you haven't capitalized on because you don't think they're that significant. If you’re still struggling to identify yours, here are some examples that will spark your creative brainstorming, including what income sources they could lead to: Now that you’re ready to position yourself for success and take the leap in bringing your skills to the world, they’re no longer hidden; they’re going to be the number one thing you’re known for and associated with. To do this, you must ask yourself, Who needs a service that predominantly utilizes this skill? You can even ask ChatGPT to help you come up with ideas so you can brainstorm several side hustle ideas or business ideas using the skills that you have. This will give you an idea of what services you can bring to the market. Now conduct some research and pick a niche. Make it precise and highly specific. If you’re too general with your offer, you’ll appeal to no one at all. After doing this, clearly define your offer and what the expected positive outcome would be. Once you’ve laid this foundation, it’s time to build visibility and credibility online. You achieve this through creating digital assets such as: Acquiring testimonials from people you’ve worked with before, or delivering the service for free in return for reviews, to no more than five people Finally, price your skill according to value, not based on time or hours worked. Pricing by the hour limits your earning potential and leads to you inadvertently under-pricing your worth. Now, here’s the exciting part: where do you go to sell your skill and the service connected with it? Here are some examples (bear in mind that not all will be relevant depending on your business and industry vertical, but you can combine several of these together to get results): You can even create an entire online persona revolving around your once hidden skill, and end up becoming the face of it.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google also removed underrepresented language from its grant website and scrubbed mention of diversity and equity from its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post that it would remain committed to DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Salesforce is getting rid of its diversity hiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Uber eliminated an incentive tied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value. It removed the entire diversity and inclusion section from its latest 10-K filing and made no use of the word diversity at all, according to the SF Examiner. UnitedHealth Group removed mention of DEI from much of its website. For example, several pages once dedicated to DEI no longer load, and the company also removed a 2022 blog post with a vice president about DEI. Yahoo removed several pages and sections that relate to or mention diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, its DEI page now redirects to the company’s executive leadership page, and the 2022 diversity report no longer loads. (Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of TechCrunch. On March 21, Regent announced it would acquire TechCrunch.) Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Title: Inside WPP’s $150 million InfoSum purchase

Time Published: 2025-04-17T04:01:00Z

Editor’s Note: This piece was updated and then re-edited to reflect GroupM’s characterization of WPP’s relationship to the market. WPP’s acquisition of data clean room InfoSum has raised eyebrows both inside and outside the industry, not just because of what it signals about the holding company’s ambitions but also because of what it reveals about its anxieties. Let’s start with the upside. The holdco has bought a business it believes, rightly or wrongly, can bolster its cash cow: GroupM. The media buying unit has faced those pressures for some time, and those cracks have played a role in several high-profile client departures over the past year. Yes, WPP has chalked up some headline wins recently — Amazon and Unilever, to name a couple — but there’s no denying that whatever GroupM is selling, CMOs aren’t buying it like they used to. The pitch is simple enough. InfoSum’s clean room uses federated learning to let marketers work with sensitive data without actually moving or exposing it. In theory, this enables rich insights by combining first-party data with a vast pool of privacy-safe signals — hundreds of billions of them — sourced from the likes of Netflix, Samsung Ads, and Channel 4, along with data partners like Experian and TransUnion. It’s the kind of offering that could further GroupM’s ongoing efforts to stitch together insights across fragmented platforms. But for all the strategic logic, the road ahead is murky. For all InfoSum’s promise, the clean room category itself is in transition. Once heralded as the cornerstone of privacy-first advertising, clean rooms lost some of their shine once marketers realized they solved only part of the puzzle. On their own, they don’t deliver the scale, simplicity, or seamless outcomes CMOs expect, especially in a landscape preferring retail media channels where data activation and measurement come bundled. In addition to the high costs, technical complexity, and limited interoperability, it’s easy to see why clean rooms have struggled to scale as point solutions. More and more, they’re being folded into larger tech stacks or absorbed into cloud infrastructure — seen as less of a strategy and more of a supporting feature. WPP may view InfoSum as a strategic linchpin for GroupM and Choreograph, but the bigger question is whether it can transform a specialized tool into something that moves the whole machine. And then there’s the trust problem. InfoSum’s appeal was built over nearly a decade on neutrality — a Switzerland for sensitive data. That’s a much harder pitch now. No matter how WPP frames it, it’s tough to imagine rival holding companies lining up to upload customer data into a platform now owned by one of their fiercest competitors. The promise of independence, once central to InfoSum’s volume, is up for debate the moment its ownership changes hands. Little wonder, then, that the deal has left some WPP clients, partners and even rivals scratching their heads over its swoop for InfoSum. One GroupM client told Digiday they had reservations over how the deal would really add value to the agency network. “Even before the deal, we were already considering whether to put the account up for review at some point this year or next,” the marketer said. Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun highlighted the challenges of integrating a clean room like InfoSum into a wider proposition during the company’s earnings call earlier this week, underscoring how closely the industry is watching not just what WPP bought but what it will now do with it. “A clean room alone is an empty shell,” said Sadoun. “If you don’t add proprietary data that will bring to your client something that they don’t have then they won’t find a new source of goals. They won’t be able to connect every individual to the entire media ecosystem.” In the weeks leading up to the purchase, InfoSum pursued a $25 million Series C investment — it raised $93 million across its prior funding rounds. InfoSum CEO Lauren Wetzel told Digiday WPP was eager to participate in the round, but it soon evolved into a wholesale takeover. “About a week out from closing the Series C, one of those investors who was new to the cap table along with WPP shifted gears and felt very strongly there was more of an opportunity for a [sale] transaction,” she added. WPP did not disclose the sum it paid for its new acquisition in its April 3 announcement, prompting speculation over InfoSum’s final exit figure. This was further fueled when Chrysalis — the lead participant of InfoSum’s 2021 raise, when it was valued at $300 million — announced a $63 million liquidation of its stake in the U.K.-headquartered company on the same day. Estimated exit prices vary, although separate sources (both of whom were investors in InfoSum) told Digiday the eventual sale price was approximately $150 million. WPP declined Digiday’s requests to comment on these claims. While Wetzel didn’t comment on the financials of the sale, she spoke on the decision to switch from raising a Series C to signing off on an acquisition. “It was compelling for our investors,” she said, “and it had to be for me to change my mind.” Additionally, sources claimed InfoSum made dozens of layoffs in the weeks leading up to the purchase — Digiday understands this number is lower than 20 — a period when Companies House initiated compulsory strike-off proceedings. According to Wetzel, who is now also GroupM’s chief solutions officer, the March 4 notice, which marked the beginning of a process that could have resulted in InfoSum’s compulsory dissolution, was the result of its fundraising efforts. According to Wetzel, the timing of its efforts to raise a Series C round meant InfoSum deferred filing its accounts with the registry of all U.K. businesses. Thus, Companies House triggered the process, which Wetzel characterized as “pretty standard” given the context. Furthermore, in the weeks since the purchase was confirmed, industry observers raised how Brian Lesser, CEO of WPP’s GroupM, was chief executive of InfoSum as recently as July of last year and whether this amounted to a conflict of interest. Digiday was told that Lesser was not part of the acquisition process for this reason. Instead, a team of technical execs oversaw the transaction and is held to the same degree of third-party oversight as any other, according to WPP. The agency network, once the undisputed heavyweight of media buying, has spent the last few years walking a tightrope: trying to modernize its infrastructure without unraveling the scale that made it powerful in the first place. The result has been a kind of strategy stutter. Internally, leadership changes have only deepened the disorientation. Over the past 18 months, the exits of GroupM’s CEO in North America, Kirk McDonald, followed by GroupM CEO Christian Juhl being replaced by Lesser a year later, have left staff unsure of who’s steering the ship and in which direction. Lesser, in particular, made waves upon his return, declaring to Adweek that within five years, “there is no human that touches a media plan.” It was meant to signal ambition, especially when paired with the familiar refrain that AI won’t take jobs, but people who use it will. For some inside GroupM, though, it landed less like a rallying cry, more like a warning — an aspirational soundbite that glossed over the day-to-day friction of a network still figuring out how to move forward. “It seemed like there was very little regard for the people who are actually running the agency, ” said the partner, echoing what they described as widespread frustration among colleagues and friends still inside the network in reaction to the quote. Outside the network, things aren’t much better. On the new business, the media group trails its rivals. Last year it ranked third behind Omnicom Media Group and Publicis in net new and retained client wins with a total value of $3.5 billion, according to COMvergence, a global research firm that tracks agency pitches. When accounting for that value without losses, it climbed to second place with $8.7 billion, still behind Omnicom. “Clients are really souring on WPP — they’re not interested in the new direction it’s on,” said a pitch consultant on condition of anonymity. “WPP has been dormant while its biggest rivals have been proactive. That’s had an impact on GroupM, which doesn’t seem to have an exciting story to tell clients in the way that Publicis Media does.” Lesser has defended the network’s performance, arguing it’s paying for sins of the past. He also noted that GroupM has actually beaten out Publicis more recently. “I think the notion that WPP is not competitive is a little bit overplayed and dramatic,” he told Digiday last week when the InfoSum deal was announced. He added, “If you look at some of our wins from late last year, whether that be Amazon, or Unilever — taking the commerce business back off Publicis, because Unilever was unhappy there — and winning J & J in a direct head-to-head with Publicis. I think that we are very competitive in the market. And frankly, when you look at our financial results, that has more to do with things that we’ve lost in the past, that we’re just feeling the after-effects of.” The irony is that for all the talk of reinvention, GroupM’s future seems increasingly straddled with the same issues as its past: a clunky operating model, an over-reliance on scale, and an uneasy relationship with the very technology it’s banking on to save it. Merkle president Pete Stein has streamlined Merkle to focus on three areas: CRM and loyalty, content and commerce, and data and analytics. He’s also brought in new leadership. As marketers eye performance levers and lower-funnel investment, ad spending on Amazon is rising further. Brandtech Group’s Jellyfish digital marketing agency has chosen to build generative AI tools to help advance search and SEO — drilling deeply into agentic efforts on behalf of clients.
