Content moderation got next on AI's job chopping block. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TikTok laid off up to 700 employees, predominantly from its Malaysian operations (via Reuters). Contrary to the massive layoffs experienced across significant tech corporations like Microsoft that have been linked to tough economic times, the ByteDance-owned company plans to replace the laid-off employees with generative AI. The rapid progression of generative AI continues to be a menace for professionals across organizations, potentially rubbishing the false sense of job security. The affected employees' roles were centered on content moderation, ensuring clips published on the viral platform adhere to community guidelines. ByteDance claims it has established that AI can flag and scrap content violating TikTok's community guidelines with an 80% success rate. As such, the company is seemingly leaning toward automating content moderation using AI to expedite the process while simultaneously promoting efficiency. Two people with close knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the job cuts impacted less than 500 employees, not 700 as previously assumed. And as it now seems, the job cuts will likely expand to other regions and countries as TikTok scales greater heights with its content moderation automation process using AI. According to Microsoft's latest Work Trend Index report, most company executives won't hire anyone without an AI aptitude, "a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles." Interestingly, the report further suggests that AI creates job opportunities contrary to popular belief that it will render professionals jobless. However, company executives have raised concerns that despite having multiple vacancies across their organizations, there isn't enough talent to fill them. In a separate report, image generation tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are getting exceptionally good at creating structural designs, posing a great danger to the future of professionals in the built environment. Interestingly, the AI tools can't make simple, plain white creations. AI isn't leaving any stone unturned in the banking sector either. According to a study, 54% of banking jobs (more than half) have a high affinity for automation, with the possibility of 12% being augmented by AI.

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman claims the fast adoption of AI in organizations will prompt software developers to stop coding, prompting them to upskill in the field to gain new skills. According to Garman: "If you go forward 24 months from now, or some amount of time — I can't exactly predict where it is — it's possible that most developers are not coding." NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar sentiments earlier this year. Huang claims coding could potentially be dead in the water as a potential career path for the next generation. Instead, he encourages the youth to explore alternative career options in biology, education, manufacturing, or farming.

The billionaire's prediction sparked controversy, with the vast majority asking how people would make a living. He painted a picture of a government social welfare concept that allocates a specific amount of money to everyone to cater to basic needs regularly. However, a job-free utopia raises questions about emotional fulfillment among people.

Title: Streaming Units Are Starting Beginning To Be Profitable

Time Published: 2024-10-11T15:08:37Z

After years of losing revenue, streaming video platfroms are beginning to be profitable. These units ... [+] have embarked on several strategies designed to grow revenue. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Only Netflix, up until recently, was able to reliably declare a profit among major streaming providers. The remaining streaming units, owned by legacy media companies, have only begun to be profitable. Becoming profitable comes at a critical time for media companies as revenue from cable television has been in a freefall. In August, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global took write downs on their linear TV business that collectively totaled $15 billion. Overall, the combined profits of Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery during the first two quarters of 2024 totaled $3.3 billion which is an increase from $683 million loss from the previous year, according to Yahoo Finance. In its most recent earnings report, Disney’s streaming unit (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) generated a quarterly profit of $47 million. It marked the first time Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit was profitable. When ESPN+ is not included, Disney recorded a loss of $19 million. One year earlier, Disney’s streaming division had reported a loss of $512 million. In its most recent earnings report, Paramount+ — the streaming unit of Paramount Global — became profitable for the first time. Paramount+ generated revenue of $26 million, compared to a loss of $424 million a year earlier. The streaming unit of Warner Bros Discovery (Max and Discovery+), had an adjusted loss of $107 million in its most recent earnings report. For calendar year 2023 however, the direct-to-consumer unit boasted a profit of $103 million. It marked the first time a streaming unit from a legacy media company had been profitable for an entire year. Although Comcast’s Peacock, in its most recent earnings report, reported a revenue loss of $348 million, the streaming unit is improving. Peacock, one year prior, had a revenue loss of $651 million. In all of 2023, Peacock lost $2.75 billion. Meanwhile, category leader Netflix continues to be the most profitable streaming provider. In its latest earnings quarterly report, Netflix recorded a net income of $2.15 billion, a year-over-year increase from $1.49 billion. Netflix revenue for the quarter was $9.56 billion, an increase of +17% from one year prior. There are several reasons for the recent improvement in revenue including increased subscriber fees, cracking down on password sharing and selling ads among other reasons. All streaming providers have to some degree increased their monthly subscriber fees to consumers. Monthly subscriber rates for leading streaming providers (Netflix, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Disney+ and Prime Video), have collectively grown from $59 in 2019 to $110 — an over 73% increase, The Drum reported. As an example, the monthly cost for the ad free tier of Disney+ has doubled from $6.99 in 2019 to $13.99 today. The monthly increase for the ad free tier of Peacock was even steeper, increasing from $4.99 in 2019 to $13.99. Steep increases in subscriber fees can backfire. A recent report from Deloitte found the households on average are paying $61 monthly, a year-over-year increase of 27% for on average four streaming providers. Many are of the opinion the cost is not worth it. In an interview, Michael Nathanson, Senior Managing Director at MoffettNathanson, noted, “For streaming, the average number of services per household has been stuck at four for a while. One of those four is Netflix, the second is Amazon—it comes with Prime—and third is some combination of Disney’s offerings. Fourth place is up for grabs. That’s what all the rest are fighting over.” The Disney acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery Communications in 2022 may have been caused by concerns of having too many streaming options. Another reason for revenue increases has been the cracking down on password sharing. Netflix took the lead in 2023 when it announced people using somebody’s password would have to start their own account. The risky decision has been working; in the past year, Netflix paid subscriber counts grew by 16.5%, exceeding estimates. Netflix is rapidly approaching 300 million (278 million) subscribers globally. Other streaming services have announced crackdowns on password sharing. Disney recently announced it would be implementing an initiative to crack down on passwords. Disney+ has introduced a new paid sharing tier. Disney’s Hulu has also curtailed password sharing. Warner Bros Discovery is also putting limits on password sharing. While Paramount+ and Peacock suggest they share passwords only within the household, neither have enforced that recommendation. As some subscribers dropped their streaming services, because of rising costs another revenue strategy has been launching an ad supported tier, at a lower subscription cost. In late 2022. both Netflix and Disney+ launched ad supported tiers. The announcements came at a time when advertisers were allocating more of the ad budget toward connected TV. In first quarter 2024, eMarketer reported 7.5% of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. have opted for less costly ad supported tier, the lowest of any streamer, followed by Max at 20.8%. Amazon’s Prime Video had the highest with 80% of subscribers receiving ads, followed by Peacock at 77.7%. According to the report, 25% of Disney+ subscribers are using the ad supported tier. For the 2024 upfronts ad dollars for Netflix grew by +150% compared to last year. There are forecasts Netflix will generate over $1 billion in ad revenue this year, surpassing Disney+. Streaming video has premium (award-winning) content coupled with younger viewers compared to linear television with fewer ads. All are appealing to advertisers. On the down side is streaming platforms have a higher cost-per-thousand than linear television. Media Dynamics reports for the 2024 TV upfronts ad dollars allocated to streaming video reached $11.1 billion, a 35% increase from 2023. Conversely, upfront ad commitments for broadcast TV and cable TV declined by -3.5% and -4.8% respectively. The ad dollars for both were below $10 billion. A study from Ampere Analysis had forecast in third quarter 2024, revenue from streaming video would be outpacing pay television for the first time. Furthermore, by 2028, the value of pay TV will be half the value it had been when it had peaked in 2017. Another strategy helping to build revenue is bundling, allowing consumers to sample new streaming services at a discounted price. The most familiar is the Disney bundle which combines Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, at a cost savings of over 40% when compared to buying the three services separately. Also, Comcast launched StreamSaver in May, a bundle available to Xfinity subscribers only. StreamSaver bundles Netflix Standard with ads, Peacock Premium with ads and Apple TV+ at a monthly fee of $15. In July. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery launched a bundling package of Disney+, Hulu and Max available to new and existing subscribers. The ad supported bundle costs $17 monthly with an ad-free tier costing $30. Last August a streaming sports bundle from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery called Venu was temporarily placed on hold by a U.S. District Court. The court sided with Fubo, a smaller streaming service that had filed an antitrust suit claiming the bundle would put them out of business. Venu is appealing the decision. There are also a number of promotions involving streaming providers such as Verizon’s myPlan and Walmart Plus among others. With many streaming users already subscribing to at least one of services being offered it can minimize the desired impact of bundling. Another trend has been a cutback in the amount of scripted content. With the streaming wars subsided after last year’s Hollywood strikes, streaming providers have opted for cutting back on costly original scripted programming. In the pre-strike year of 2022, there were about 600 original and scripted programs, which industry analysts conclude will be the high-water mark. Also, in a first, in 2023, the number of series released on streaming platforms had dropped. What has increased however, has been live streaming sports. S&P Global Market Intelligence projects U.S. sports rights cost $30 billion across linear television and streaming. The figure could grow to $35 billion by 2027. Driving the increase has been streaming driven by the deep pocketed Amazon, Apple and, more recently, Netflix and Alphabet. Amazon has been streaming NFL Thursday Night Football for three seasons and has added NASCAR. Starting with the 2025-26 season Amazon will be streaming NBA and WNBA games outbidding Warner Bros Discovery. Apple TV+ has been streaming a package of MLB games on Friday nights and MLS games. Alphabet’s YouTube has been streaming out-of-market NFL games with Sunday Ticket. Also, Netflix will be streaming two NFL games on Christmas Day. Over the summer Peacock streamed over 5,000 hours of the Paris Olympics averaging over four million viewers each day. According to Antenna, in its first week of Olympics, Peacock added 2.8 million new subscribers. Last January, Peacock live streamed an early-round NFL playoff game. For the game, Peacock added three million new subscribers, 71% of whom were still using the service two months later. (Prime Video will be streaming the NFL game this January.) Peacock will also be live streaming NBA games starting in 2025-26 and WNBA games beginning in 2026. Although revenue losses in their streaming units are abating, several media companies are continuing to cut costs. Paramount Global recently announced more layoffs reducing U.S. employees by 15% (2,000 employees), resulting in a savings of about $500 million. As part of the cutbacks will be the closing of Paramount TV Studios. Earlier in the year, Paramount had laid off another 800 employees. In July Paramount Global announced a merger with David Ellison’s Skydance in a $8 billion deal. Also, to cut costs, in September, Disney announced cutbacks impacting 300 employees across several divisions. In another cost-cutting maneuver Warner Bros. Discovery in July announced another round of layoffs impacting about 1,000 employees in the production, business affairs and finance units. Earlier in the month CNN laid off about 100 workers.

Title: Spotify doubles down on remote work policy, Layoffs and their longer term business impacts

Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Greetings, comms pros! Let’s take a look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Spotify commits to ‘work anywhere’ policy amid RTO push at other companies As other companies like Amazon work to bring their employees back to their desks, Spotify is pushing in the other direction and reaffirming its commitment to allowing employees to work wherever they choose. According to Raconteur: “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” says Katarina Berg, Spotify’s CHRO. While she says she understands why some companies have returned to the office, “they are going back to what they know”, Berg is yet to find a reason to enforce a mandate for Spotify’s employees. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom?” she says. “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” Berg’s willingness to back her organization’s employees so publicly in the context of Spotify’s history of allowing employees to work remotely is refreshing at a time when other companies scramble to justify reasons to get people back to their desks. Speaking openly about the autonomy the company gives them in allowing them to make their own choices is a lesson in employee experience, employer trust, and employer branding that other companies can learn. Your employees are your greatest asset and give your company its identity. Treat them respectfully and like the talented professionals they are, and it’ll be a lot easier to recruit and retain people.

Report: Layoffs impact the business beyond job cuts Nobody likes to talk about layoffs. But what about the longer-term impacts they create for companies that they happen to? According to a study by Harvard Business Review, organizations that had “committed” employees felt layoffs even harder than those with less loyal employees. Additionally, intangibles like pride, future motivation, and recommendations to others outside the company each dropped by a factor of more than 10% following a layoff. Layoffs do a lot more than just let go of valued colleagues. They serve as a reset point for organizations, and if they’re not carefully planned, companies risk poisoning their cultural wells. By running all layoff comms through a lens of empathy and commitment to mission and values, these impacts can be lessened, even if there is some inevitable sour sentiment. 3. Home Depot requires corporate employees to work retail shifts Deeper interaction by corporate employees with front-facing workers can help create a deeper appreciation for the culture and function of the business. Home Depot is taking this a step further, and getting its desk workers to don orange aprons several times a year. The policy mandates corporate employees to spend one full shift in stores quarterly to better gain an appreciation for the business and culture, Home Depot said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg. According to Bloomberg: “We need to stay connected to the core of our business, so we can truly understand the challenges and opportunities our store associates face every day,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Decker said in the memo introducing the program. A company spokesperson said it’s been the company’s longstanding practice to ask staff to spend time in stores, with this new program being its latest initiative. What better way for communicators to learn about who they’re messaging with and to than spending a day in the shoes of front-facing workers? Comms pros do their best work when they understand the culture and values of a company inside and out. Tying on the ubiquitous Home Depot apron and learning firsthand about the challenges and opportunities of your frontline audience is a great way to achieve that goal, especially with the blessing of leadership. 4.

Title: In court, Albertsons CEO warns that merger failure may force cutbacks by company

If the merger with Kroger doesn’t go through, the CEO of Albertsons Cos. Inc. said in court Wednesday that his company might have to consider layoffs and leave certain markets to remain competitive and financially secure in the long term.Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition.Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys. A merger of the two competitors would violate state antitrust laws, the attorney general’s office said.But Sankaran said the two chains see merging as the best way to compete against Walmart, first nationally in grocery sales, as well as such fast-growing food sellers as Amazon and Costco. Walmart and Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart, account for about a quarter of the country’s grocery business, he said.“We can do many things to improve the company, but at some point the ability to compete with the Amazons and Costcos and Walmarts of the world, you just need added scale. We knew we wouldn’t be able to get that by ourselves,” Sankaran said.Albertsons began looking for ways to grow and merging with another company was one of the possibilities. Soon after Albertsons and Kroger announced consolidation plans in October 2022, several United Food and Commercial Workers locals, state and local officials came out in opposition.The Federal Trade Commission has sued to put the merger on hold until it can finish its proceedings aimed at stopping the companies’ plan. A decision in the FTC’s lawsuit is pending.A trial is underway in the lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, whose complaints against the merger are similar to Colorado’s. In Colorado, Albertsons and Kroger are prime rivals in the grocery industry, according to an analysis presented by the state last week in court. The analysis produced by an expert witness for the state played down the competition posed by Costco, Amazon, Whole Foods and other retailers.But asked who he sees as Albertsons’ biggest threat, Sankaran said Walmart, Amazon and Costco are among his biggest worries. “These competitors are growing so fast and they’re already large. They’re who I worry about in the long run.”Sankaran said data on where customers in Colorado shop shows that for every $1 spent on groceries, Albertsons reaps 14 cents. Kroger takes in 16 cents and Amazon gets about 5 cents. Walmart captures the biggest share: 20 cents on the dollar. The rest of the money goes to a variety of entities, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.To try to ensure there will be competition in the market after the merger, Kroger and Albertsons have struck a $2.9 billion deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which would buy 579 of their stores nationwide. In Colorado, C&S would buy 91 Safeway and Albertsons stores and a dairy plant. Kroger would retain 14 of the stores in the state.Kroger and Albertsons have said C&S, a grocery distributor that now operates just 25 retail grocery stores, has the resources to take over the stores. But Roger Davidson, an industry consultant testifying Wednesday for the state, said he expects that stores bought by C&S will see declining revenue and some will likely close.Davidson said C&S won’t have enough people or a strong enough retail infrastructure to successfully run all the stores it plans to acquire.Jason Slothouber with the attorney general’s office asked Sankaran about the potential impacts on communities and workers if stores in more remote parts of the state close after the merger.“Even if C&S crashes and burns, you have this golden parachute for yourself,” Slothouber said.Sankaran acknowledged that he will receive a total of $43 million in equity and severance if the merger is completed. “I realize it’s a lot of money for a guy who came from India with a suitcase. I don’t take that lightly,” he said.Related Articles Retail | State says Kroger-Albertsons merger may cost Coloradans $500M per year; companies dispute claim Retail | Colorado next up to argue its case against Kroger-Albertsons mega merger Retail | Montbello’s status as a food desert to end next year with $97M project that includes grocery store, housing and more Retail | Kroger and Albertsons make a final pitch for their merger before a judge decides whether to block it Retail | A state’s experience with grocery chain mergers spurs a fight to stop Albertsons’ deal with Kroger But he called Slothhouber’s questions about stores closing and people losing their jobs “hypotheticals” that he couldn’t answer.Kroger and Albertsons have said that stores won’t close, people won’t lose their jobs and wages will increase if the merger goes through.

The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under new CEO Andy Jassy Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. "Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go." The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

The technology was adapted for vans’ cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. “Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer’s name or address to ensure they have the right packages,” Amazon said in a release. “They simply have to look for VAPR’s green light, grab and go.” The announcement underscores Amazon’s shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones — a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon’s low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

Title: Industry Veteran Jeff Sagansky Rebukes Hollywood Studios for Decisions Leading to ‘Unbelievable Cataclysm in the Business’

TheGrill 2024: Sagansky and Peter Guber debate the transformative shift caused by the end of TV profits and rise of streaming ambitions Investor Jeff Sagansky took Hollywood to task for decisions that have led to a massive destruction of value and are causing an “unbelievable cataclysm in the business,” speaking in a keynote interview at TheWrap’s Grill conference on Tuesday. “You’re seeing the traditional business collapse,” he said in a conversation with entertainment entrepreneur Peter Guber and TheWrap’s editor in chief Sharon Waxman. “And at the same time, you’re seeing all this predatory behavior from the streamers and the two of them together are causing unbelievable cataclysm in the business that we both love.” Sagansky accused Hollywood’s traditional studios of accelerating the decline of linear television by choosing to abandon programming in favor of streaming platforms, which led to what he called “predatory” behavior from streamers. “It’s still [a] $150 billion value business in terms of revenues,” he added, noting that major sports like the NBA, MLB and NFL alone represent a $40 billion business, much smaller by contrast. Sagansky also predicted that the four leading streamers — Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney/Hulu and Max — would form an entertainment oligopoly that is likely to draw scrutiny from government regulators. Sagansky highlighted a total loss of $190 billion in value in the stock prices of major entertainment companies including Warner Bros Discovery, Disney and Paramount, noting that television, the traditional driver of the entertainment industry for half a century, has lost “almost half” of its audience. Guber, another Hollywood veteran and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and the Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner, noted that amid mass layoffs, steep cuts in production, and an anxious search for streaming profitability, there’s more uncertainty in Hollywood than ever. “There will be blood, just like the movie, but there will also be opportunity,” Guber said. “Don’t give up on entertainment. It’s been around for thousands of years. It’s not going to go away in 2025.” During the conversation, Sagansky said he is still astounded by how entertainment companies got to this point: by pushing their film and TV libraries to Netflix in response to the decline of the DVD market in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “When streaming starts, people have a choice they can make, and they make it. So what does cable do? They raised the prices. They produced less programming at a time when the building was on fire,” Sagansky said. “They just looked at their cash cow and said ‘OK, it’s over,’ and that was a fundamental mistake.” While there are differences between live sports and the rest of entertainment, Guber believes there’s one key similarity to finding success in both worlds: find a position as the bridge between artist and audience. As part of the ownership groups behind the Dodgers and Warriors, he sees those teams’ venues — the new Chase Center in San Francisco and the venerable Dodger Stadium in L.A. — as “cathedrals” that foster generational connections between teams and fans. And he said he tries to make those venues into places that people feel active in the story being told during the game. “You have to find your way through, to be active in your own rescue,” Guber said. “Don’t wait just for the government to give you a clear path. Create your own path. If you don’t, you will be on the dustbin of history.” Sagansky and Guber also discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence on filmmaking and whether it will expand or curtail opportunities for filmmakers. To see that debate, check out the clip above. (Full interview to follow.) During Tuesday’s TheGrill, five other business panels tackled different aspects of AI in Hollywood. In a panel focused on how to balance “innovation and ethics” actor and director Justine Bateman said AI would “burn the industry to the ground” by eliminating numerous job functions, which Edouard Harris, CTO of Gladstone AI, predicted that Hollywood would break off into a two-pronged system of those supporting and not supporting AI implementation. In another panel moderated by Waxman, Fox Corp. CTO Melody Hildebrandt called on the industry to take a long view on AI and be “peers to big tech in the exploitation of it.” And in a spotlight conversation, Jeffrey Bennett, SAG-AFTRA’s general counsel, broke down the timeline for what needs to happen for AI protections to be adopted nationwide. And in an afternoon session about balancing the protection of creative rights with opportunities, Alexandra Shannon, head of strategic development at CAA, detailed the creation of theCAAvault to store actors’ likenesses for use in other AI-generated applications with legal consent. Not all the day’s event dealt with AI. Two panels featured top journalists like former New York Times staffer Laura Holson, Oliver Darcy and former LA Times Executive Director Kevin Merida, discussing the state of the media industry. And in a session centered on redefining success in sports and business, WNBA Champion Sue Bird and soccer legend Megan Rapinoe, along with Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, discussed how mainstream traction for women’s sports continues to be met with gaslighting and industry resistance. “The goalpost is moving,” Rapinoe said.

Title: What went wrong at CVS?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Pharmacy chains are in crisis The pharmacy industry is in crisis. That's especially true at CVS, where layoffs are piling on top of layoffs — and the future of the company is in question. CVS Health announced this month that it is laying off 2,000 workers, CNN said, as part of an effort to "slash costs" across the company. That's on top of the 5,000 layoffs it announced last year, and after the company closed around 900 stores in recent years. CVS and other drug store chains are "struggling" due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, CNN said. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," said a company spokesperson. CVS' problems are also "very specific to the company," said Axios. In addition to its pharmacies, CVS is also a "major insurer" — it bought Aetna in 2017 — as well as a pharmacy benefit manager. Yes, "retail pharmacy in general is struggling," but CVS' challenges "could just be the specific businesses it has combined," Axios said. That's why company leaders are reportedly considering breaking up those businesses — an extraordinary move in an era where "vertical integration is all the rage." Escape your echo chamber.

"Satisfaction with brick-and-mortar pharmacies dropped 10 points in 2024," said Time. Customers report short-staffed outlets with "long lines and frustrating experiences." It's not just CVS: Rite Aid recently emerged from bankruptcy, and Walgreens is planning to close one-fourth of its roughly 8,600 stores. Customers simply didn't return to brick-and-mortar stores after the pandemic, preferring cheaper online alternatives. "The current pharmacy model is not sustainable," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in June. That affects communities. The mass closure of retail pharmacies is a "growing worry for health experts," said the Missouri Independent. The problem is "most acute" in places with low incomes — "urban cores" and rural areas where pharmacies are the "convenience stores of the health care system." That makes getting necessary medications a growing challenge for the people who live in those places. "When those community pharmacies close, communities lose critical access," said one expert. One other factor in the struggles of CVS and its industry: "Heavy competition" from Amazon and Walmart, said the Los Angeles Times. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) also play a role — they have "significant control" over how much insurers pay pharmacies for medications and have worked to push down those reimbursement costs. That pushes down pharmacy profitability. One irony: CVS owns Caremark, a PBM. "That's made the drug retail business more healthy," said one analyst — but it still hasn't made CVS "immune to market forces," said the Times. CVS' board is looking at "splitting the company," said The Wall Street Journal. That could be difficult. The spun-off businesses "might struggle to flourish on their own." The mergers with Aetna and Caremark were supposed to "bring down costs and give patients more convenient, accessible care." That didn't pan out. Now the future of the company is in limbo, the Journal said: CVS' board "isn't expected to make a decision soon."

Clark on Tuesday launched a new venture, called Auger, which aims to help companies and governments combine the mishmash of "Franken-software" overseeing their supply chains into a single platform. "At Flexport, I got to see all of these companies in the middle, like the Nikes or Lululemons, and I was amazed at how much of a struggle it is, and how much they still use Excel or Smartsheet or Tableau or something to bring all this disparate data together in such a way that they can do something," Clark said in an interview. "A shocking amount of supply chain still runs on Excel." Clark's third act follows a short but tumultuous stint at Flexport. Last September, Clark abruptly resigned as CEO of Flexport, allowing for the return of its founder, Ryan Petersen. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark overspent and overhired during his time at the freight forwarding startup. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark, showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Petersen has since taken steps to turn around the business by overhauling its top ranks, implementing layoffs and subleasing excess warehouse space. Before Flexport, Clark developed a storied reputation during his 23 years at Amazon as the architect of its mammoth logistics network. He joined Amazon's operations division in 1999 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most important executives at the company. In 2020, Amazon tapped Clark to head its core retail business after longtime executive Jeff Wilke left the company. Clark departed Amazon for Flexport in 2022. Clark joined Flexport to bring what he had built at Amazon to "small businesses and other businesses around the world." He left the startup feeling there was still a gap in the market for supply chain tools, and began to develop the idea behind Auger. The name is meant to convey the drilling tool's ability to break through things and dive deep. "I spent the last year with the chance to really sort of step back and think about the best way to tackle this problem," Clark said. "What do I want to do next? Do I still want to try to tackle this problem? Do I want to do something else? And I just kept coming back to, this should not be a problem for companies with the technology that exists in the world." He said a typical company might have "eight to 10 to 12 to 20" systems for procurement, forecasting, and enterprise resource planning. The systems can be clunky and are rarely integrated. He wanted to build a platform where companies could manage their supply chain with the "same level of simplicity and intuitiveness as the consumer applications that they use every day." Clark, who moved with his family to Texas before leaving Amazon, has returned to his former employer's backyard in Seattle to work on the new venture, which will be based in Bellevue, Washington. He hopes to pull from the area's deep bench of tech talent. Amazon last year rolled out its own supply chain management platform, which can handle the process of transporting businesses' goods from the manufacturer to customers' doorsteps. But the service is targeted at businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and use its logistics and fulfillment network. Auger's launch comes as venture deal volume has steadily declined over the past few years, aside from investments in artificial intelligence companies. U.S. venture capital exit value this year is expected to reach $98 billion, down 86% from 2021, according to an Aug. 29 report from PitchBook, while venture-backed IPOs are expected to be at their lowest since 2016. VC activity in the supply chain tech industry has shown recent improvement, although it's well below the levels seen in 2021 and 2022. Global investment in the space hit $2.4 billion, marking the third straight quarter of growth, according to Pitchbook. Auger has raised $100 million from venture firm Oak HC/FT. Clark said he soon expects to grow headcount to about 20 employees and intends to launch a "V1" product within nine months.

Title: Spotify’s HR chief says remote staff aren’t ‘children’ as company reaffirms work-from-anywhere policy
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/08/spotifys-hr-chief-remote-staff-flexible-work-policy/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:21Z
Full Content:
Amid a raft of return-to-office mandates from tech giants, including Amazon and iPhone challenger Nothing, Spotify sees no need to treat its staff like “children” and end its popular work-from-home policy. Spotify went through an overhaul last year, laying off 17% of its staff in December in a move CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged had a larger impact on operations than the company had anticipated. The decision has helped almost double Spotify’s market value this year, as the group notched record quarterly revenues while cutting costs. However, inside Spotify, the layoffs have shaken morale. For those who survived the cull, there isn’t likely to be a further morale-sapping plan to break with Spotify’s popular “work from anywhere” policy. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grownups and then treat them like children,” Spotify’s chief human resources officer Katarina Berg told Raconteur, explaining the group’s continued flexible work location policy. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom? “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” In February 2021, Spotify joined several other tech groups in allowing its employees to “work from anywhere.” This enabled employees to choose where and how they worked, provided the company had an office in that jurisdiction. Unlike other companies that have trickled employees back in on a hybrid basis, like Meta, or gone all-out and demanded a full return to the office, like Amazon, Spotify hasn’t chosen to renege on this policy. A big reason is likely the effect it has had on retention. Spotify said attrition rates were 15% lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2019. The company also said it had improved the diversity of its talent. While Spotify doesn’t intend to scrap its remote-working policy anytime soon, Berg acknowledged it wasn’t an ideal setup. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” Berg said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.” The company is still using innovative ways to encourage its music-loving staff to come into the office, including hosting “listening lounge” sessions featuring pop stars including Olivia Dean and Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. Staff are also strongly encouraged to come into the office during Spotify’s “core week” to reconnect and discuss strategy. Spotify’s biggest-ever round of layoffs last December, when it said goodbye to 1,500 staff, came as CEO Ek said the company was doing too much “work around the work.” The impact of those layoffs on operations was bigger than Ek expected, with Berg explaining to Raconteur that remaining staffers were left in a “state of shock” by the cull. “Spotify had been in hypergrowth, and this was the only thing people knew,” she said. “A lot of people at Spotify had never seen a recession, and it was a lot to absorb and digest.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

More recently, the company has rolled out a controversial five-day-a-week RTO mandate, which some believe to be an effort to thin the company’s ranks and trim unneeded roles. Some employees have already voiced their opposition to the RTO mandate, with some saying they have no intention of complying, often because they were hired during the pandemic, assured remote work would continue, and live outside commuting range of any corporate office. It’s unclear at this time if Amazon will primarily target these individuals, or if the layoffs will have a wider scope.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's work-from-office mandate aims to help new recruits learn company work culture

Amazon Inc Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy's decision to bring back employees to the office full-time shows the executive's concern that new recruits don't understand the company culture, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Monday, October 7. Last month, Jassy surprised the employees with a memo instructing them to start coming to the office five days a week from January. Amazon currently lets many employees work from home two days a week, as per the report. The order stunned many of Amazon's more than 350,000 employees and restarted a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. They wonder if this was Jassy’s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. The CEO expressed his intention to reduce management layers in efforts to reduce bureaucracy, which, according to him, was slowing down Amazon, as per the agency report. The senior leadership made the part change, as they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people aware of the development cited by the agency. Jassy mentioned the word “culture” a dozen times in his memo. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” he wrote. “You have to work at it all the time,” according to the report. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser refused to comment beyond the CEO's memo, as per the report. Amazon, which sees itself as operating like a startup, has long acknowledged that its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid deck slides. According to the report, there’s a strong preference for analysis of data and trends and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate. Amazon is also famous for its tough environment and aggressive deadlines, as employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, according to founder Jeff Bezos who put it to the company's first recruits. According to the CEO's colleagues, Jassy who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches. After succeeding Bezos three years ago, he’s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he explains each of Amazon’s leadership principles, said the report. Amazon doubled its headcount and reduced the requirement for recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Company executives have been openly saying that fresh grads, new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company's culture which cannot be effectively conveyed through videoconferences or chat windows. “Culture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,” said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, at a press event last week. “And that’s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you’re over a video call,” according to the agency report. Keeping in mind the new schedule would be controversial, senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people aware of the development. The company denied the policy was designed to push employees out, according to the report. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider, in internal surveys. Some of the employees have already resigned and others are seeking work in other places. The last time the company ordered its employees to come back to the office for work, employees walked out at the company's Seattle headquarters, as per the report. It is unclear whether the employees will make a similar attempt again. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
