President Donald Trump claimed a big win this past Wednesday when he convinced some 75 countries to negotiate on trade and tariffs, leaving China out in the cold. In doing so, he also avoided a bond market disaster. But we are not be out of the woods yet. Thousands of American businesses, and potentially millions of employees, are still on the front lines of the trade war with China — a war that took many by surprise. The risks of that confrontation threaten the entire U.S. economy. That is not to minimize what the Trump administration achieved this week, after the president took on all comers in a global trade confrontation, like Bruce Lee in a kung fu movie. In doing so, Trump goaded China into taking a hard line that cut it off, not just from U.S. markets but, potentially, from an entire American trading bloc. Whether Trump had gamed out every exact move, or simply found a path by applying constant pressure, it worked. China has been a disruptive player in global markets ever since it was admitted to the World Trade Organization 25 years ago, without having reformed its internal politics since the horrors of Tiananmen Square. But the U.S. and others believed that trade would make China’s political system more democratic, as it made China’s economy more free. And American companies wanted access to the vast Chinese market, and China’s labor force. At first, trade between China and the rest of the world was mutually beneficial. Many U.S. firms set up production facilities in China, while Hollywood found a large new audience for its cultural products. American consumers benefited from lower prices, and China’s middle class began to flourish. But then China started outcompeting its trading parters. Around the world, for example, textile factories began shutting down, unable to match low Chinese labor costs. China also stole the intellectual property of western firms. It insisted that they share their knowledge as a condition of doing business in the country — then set up Chinese firms that outcompeted the foreign ones. China also kept labor costs artificially low, in some industries, by using exploitative labor practices — or, in the case of the Uighur Muslims, slave labor. Some U.S. companies began pulling out of China; others saw no real alternative to operating there. Meanwhile, China held a growing amount of American public debt, giving it leverage over the U.S. Instead of China becoming more like America, the U.S. became more like China. Movie studios shaped their content to avoid offending Chinese audiences. Social media companies began helping the government censor its critics. And during the coronavirus pandemic — which began in China — U.S. authorities shut down the economy; some shut own basic rghts. The Wall Street Journal’s William Galston, the paper’s only left-of-center columnist, observed that much of the anxiety over globalization was not a function of trade itself but of the unique challenge that China posed. Conventional economic rules did not seem to apply to a trading partner that had the power to distort markets on its own. Admitted into a “free trade” system, China has tried to manipulate the rules to dominate trade for its own enrichment and power. Trump is the first president to have perceived that China is both a partner and a rival, perhaps even an enemy. He launched, and won, a trade war with China in his first term, and began a process of “decoupling” from China, especially after the coronavirus. That process might have continued, had Trump not lost to Joe Biden in 2020 — a president with corrupt business ties to China, through his son, Hunter — a story the media worked hard to suppress when it emerged. Trump has returned — four years, and trillions of dollars in American public debt, later — and he has adopted a more aggressive strategy to counter China. That includes controlling key points on global trade routes — Greenland, the Panama canal, Gaza (near the Suez Canal), the Cape of Good Hope — and launching the ongoing trade war, which has led China to retaliate, even as other U.S. trading partners sought opportunities for negotiation and compromise. We will have to wait for the history books and the insider accounts to learn how much of the last week was clever calculation, and how much was blunder and luck. But it seems likely that Trump’s ultimate goal was, consciously, to divide the world into trading blocs and ask our trading partners to make a choice: either the authoritarian, communist regime of China; or the democratic, free market system of the United States, flawed and messy though it may be. That strategy is well on its way. But it has also left thousands of American entrepreneurs, and potentially millions of workers, in the lurch. Giant companies like Apple can move production from China to India. For anything smaller, the tariffs are absolutely devastating — whether little mom-and-pop stores selling imported goods, small manufacturers using Chinese components in American factories, or gutsy inventors looking to scale up production beyond their garages. I spoke to an old friend from my Chicago days, Rick Woldenberg, this week. His toy company, Learning Resources, makes educational products that you may recognize from your childhood or your children’s schools. When the China tariffs, and counter-tariffs, hit this week, he was forced to pause production and shipping throughout his entire U.S.-China operation. His tax bill went up 50 times — yes, five-zero — from $2.3 million to $100.2 million, overnight. At a 20% tariff, Rick says, American companies like his got the message: move production out of China. At a 145% tariff, Rick says, the message is: “Die.” Rick’s company is a family business that has been around for a century. It employs 500 people, many in the Midwest. It had, until now, been in solid financial shape. Now, Rick told me, he faces going out of business. And he warned that if he faces that risk, then thousands of other companies doing business in China, who may have less flexibility than his, could be making similar choices. A “contagion effect” may be imminent: a cascade of layoffs and closures. With more than a hint of bitterness, he says he was doing fine before President Trump decided toe “fix” things. He understands the larger economic and strategic issues at stake, but his first responsibility is to his customers, his 500 employees, and his family legacy — a legacy of manufacturing, most of it in America. Rick has a suggestion: as long as we are pausing the implementation of tariffs on everyone else for 90 days, why not pause the tariffs for China as well? At least for long enough for his company to shift production, long enough to produce Christmas orders and put them on the water by July. Christmas, he notes, might be very cold indeed if the goods on which retailers depend fail to arrive in American ports. And we won’t be able to make them domestically yet. Perhaps this is all part of the plan — the anticipated cost of the trade war that may, in fact, have been inevitable, whether Trump decided to take a stand right now or leave the task to someone else. But if there is any way to mitigate that cost, it could provide Trump with the political cover he will need to fight this war to victory. A “Christmas truce” — extending the 90-day pause to tariffs on China, to fill Christmas orders — could be a timely, essential respite. Joel B.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy calls for startup culture in shareholder letter to drive innovation
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107500-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-calls-startup-culture-shareholder.html
Time Published: 2025-04-10T19:56:00Z

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently outlined his vision for the company in an annual letter to shareholders, blending startup-style agility with the scale of a global giant. He addressed challenges, including artificial intelligence investments and internal culture shifts, and stressed the need to innovate quickly and cut inefficiencies to remain competitive in fast-moving markets. Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, said he wants to run Amazon as if it were "the world's largest startup." The approach focuses on solving customer problems, encouraging invention, and giving employees ownership of their work. "Builders hate bureaucracy," Jassy wrote. "It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do." He revealed that in his time, Amazon had solicited employee feedback on bureaucratic hurdles and implemented over 375 changes based on nearly 1,000 responses. Jassy also detailed Amazon's artificial intelligence strategy, noting that a large share of this year's $100 billion in capital spending will go toward AI projects – especially within the Amazon Web Services division. Amazon's push to embed AI across customer-facing products and internal systems makes AWS crucial to its AI goals. Healthcare was another focal point in Jassy's letter. He highlighted Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical as key growth areas and pledged to "iterate quickly" to expand both services. Jassy's tenure has brought major cultural and structural shifts to Amazon. In addition to cost-cutting efforts that led to tens of thousands of layoffs, he has enforced a return-to-office policy for corporate employees, rolling back the remote work flexibility introduced during the pandemic. Jassy emphasized key principles for maintaining Amazon's innovative edge. Speed was a recurring theme. "Speed is a leadership decision," he wrote, stressing that companies can move quickly without sacrificing quality by removing structural barriers and streamlining decision-making processes. He emphasized scrappiness as a key trait of effective teams, referencing Amazon's early days when small teams with limited resources developed services like Simple Storage Service and Elastic Compute Cloud. Jassy believes that fear of failure often stifles creativity, arguing that bold bets driven by customer obsession are key to achieving extraordinary results. "You rarely, if ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everyone else," he wrote. Ultimately, Jassy stressed that delivering tangible customer value is Amazon's most important success metric. Charisma or internal politics, he noted, should never take precedence over results when it comes to rewards or recognition.

Amazon plans huge expansion of its logistics facilities When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is reportedly planning to invest a staggering $15 billion across no less than 80 new logistics facilities across the US in a bid to better serve both cities and rural areas. A report from Bloomberg claims the company is planning to develop new delivery hubs, with some being large fulfillment centers equipped with state-of-the-art robots. Amazon is now inviting capital partners to submit proposals in what’s seen as welcome news amid ongoing tariff-induced economic uncertainty. When the world moved to remote and online habits during the pandemic, Amazon was believed to have overspent on retail infrastructure and staffing, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. Between November 2022 and March 2023, Amazon laid off around 27,000 workers. Although its ecommerce business continues to grow, recent investments have largely focused on cloud and AI technologies, so it’s reassuring to see that the online retail giant is hasn’t given up on what it’s known best for by consumers. Speaking about the company’s fourth-quarter and year-end results, Jassy noted Amazon had delivered its “fastest speeds ever” for Prime in 2024, with a 65% year-over-year increase in US orders delivered on the same day or overnight, thanks largely to its expansive network of logistics facilities and transportation resources. The company now has around 600 fulfillment centers in the US alone, but no timeline has been shared for the addition of another 80. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite a positive outlook, it’s clear that Amazon isn’t immune from the ongoing trade war, having reportedly canceled numerous orders from China and other Asian countries over tariffs. Amazon told us that the projects being discussed aren't finalized, but they are still ideas that are up for consideration. Steve Kelly, a spokesperson for Amazon, noted: "Meetings like this with our capital partners are routine and part of the normal due diligence process, as we consider potential, future projects." The company also confirmed some figures to us – Amazon supports nearly five million jobs across the US, having invested over $244 billion into the nation in 2023 alone.

Title: 'This Is Life or Death': American Mom-and-Pop Businesses Could Still Collapse as China Tariffs Climb; Want 90-Day Pause to 'Save Christmas'

Many small businesses are still threatened by the trade war facing the United States, even though President Donald Trump suspended most tariffs for 90 days. The escalating tariffs on China have halted imports — and manufacturing — for many American companies, including mom-and-pop stores and family-owned businesses that cannot easily shift production or sourcing to other countries. ‘This is life or death,” says Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, a century-old toy manufacturing company that makes educational materials for thousands of American schools. Woldenberg told Breitbart News that the Trump administration’s tariffs on China — which hit 145% as of Thursday morning — would cause his tax bill to rise from roughly $2 million to $100 million — overnight. To stay in business, Woldenberg estimated that he would have to raise his prices 40-45%. Otherwise, “[Trump] is killing me. I’m dead.” Woldenberg also estimates that he has 10,000 molds at a port in China, weighing approximately 7,000,000 pounds, and he has to find something to do with them if he cannot import them and face the steep tax that follows. Learning Resources, and other companies that source components from China, are being forced to halt production or block shipments from leaving port in China. The result could be factory closures cascading layoffs — not just in China, which is the target of Trump’s policy, but also in the U.S, meaning Wednesday’s stock-market joy could be short-lived. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday: “More container-shipping companies are cancelling sailings from Asia to the U.S. and Europe.” And other entrepreneurs are echoing Woldenberg’s fears of a massive impact on U.S. industry — precisely the opposite of the effect intended by Trump’s policy, which aims to protect and grow U.S. manufacturing. Woldenberg would like the administration to implement a 90-day pause on the China tariffs, just as it has done with other tariffs. “At least let us get the Christmas orders in,” he said, noting that 90 days would allow American firms to put goods afloat in time for the most important retail season of the year. “Otherwise, it’s going to be nuclear winter.” Joel B.

Title: More Microsoft job cuts could hit non-coding staff and middle managers
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107494-more-microsoft-job-cuts-could-hit-non-coding.html
Time Published: 2025-04-10T14:57:00Z

In brief: Microsoft is considering making more job cuts this year, adding to the performance-based layoffs and other terminations it has implemented in 2025 so far. The latest round could come as soon as May and will reportedly target managers and non-coding staff. Some Microsoft organizations are looking to increase their span of control, defined as the number of direct reports or subordinates a manager or supervisor oversees. It also wants to increase the number of coders compared to non-coders on projects, According to anonymous people familiar with the matter who spoke to Business Insider, Microsoft has yet to decide how many jobs will be cut, though one person said it could be a significant portion of their team. Other companies such as Amazon and Google are also reducing the number of managers and executives in their drive for efficiency. Microsoft wants to decrease the ratio of product/program managers (PMs) to engineers. Microsoft security boss Charlie Bell's division has a ratio of around 5.5 engineers to one PM, but he wants that to reach 10:1. News that Microsoft is targeting non-coders in these cuts is in contrast to the many stories about generative AI replacing the need for programmers. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott made the startling prediction last week that 95% of all code will be generated by AI by 2030. He added that humans would still be involved in the process, though it's easy to imagine that there will be fewer of them. At the start of the year, Microsoft confirmed it was implementing performance-based layoffs, though it said those let go would be replaced with new hires. Microsoft rates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 and bases their stock awards and bonuses on this rating. Anyone in the 60 to 80 range – 100 is average – is rated as a low performer. Soon after those performance cuts were revealed, the company said it was making more job cuts across its business, impacting employees in the gaming, experience & devices, sales, and security divisions. In other Microsoft news, the company this week terminated the employment of two engineers who protested against its AI-related contracts with the Israeli government.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Freeze: What Could Have Happened if They Stayed in Place?
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2025/trumps-tariff-freeze-what-could-have-happened-if-they-stayed-in-place/

Highlights Trump's temporary freeze on reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, provided short-term market relief, prompting a 2,200-point surge in the Dow Jones. Had tariffs remained, businesses such as Walmart, Target, PepsiCo and smaller retailers anticipated significant price increases and supply chain disruptions across groceries, clothing and electronics. Economists estimated that sustained tariffs could have raised consumer prices substantially, reduced annual GDP growth by approximately 0.6% and cost the economy between $80 billion and $110 billion per year. Hate to say you read it here first, but here’s a prescient quote left on the cutting room floor from PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster’s interview with QED Investors partner Amias Gerety just two days ago: “Because this is a self-inflicted economic wound, we get an extra dollop of uncertainty. Trump could reverse all of these tomorrow.” He waited until the day after tomorrow. On Wednesday (April 9) Trump announced a temporary suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most countries, reducing rates to a universal 10%. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were escalated to a staggering 125%, citing China’s “disrespect” toward global markets. This sharp increase followed China’s retaliatory tariffs earlier in the week, intensifying trade tensions between the two countries. The pause provided temporary relief to many industries and market, as seen in the Dow Jones surge by nearly 2,200 points. However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications. The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time. Had the tariffs remained in place, companies across various sectors were poised to pass increased costs onto consumers. Grocery chains like Morton Williams anticipated price hikes of up to 20% on imported items such as olive oil and canned tuna due to tariff impacts. Retailers like Target had already adjusted their inventory strategies earlier in the year to mitigate immediate price shocks but warned of steep increases for perishable goods like fresh produce within weeks. Similarly, manufacturers reliant on imported components faced significant challenges. PepsiCo noted declining snack sales due to inflationary pressures even before the tariff announcements. If sustained, higher tariffs could have exacerbated these trends, forcing companies to shrink product sizes (shrinkflation) or reduce offerings altogether. For smaller businesses with limited capacity to absorb costs, the effects would have been even more pronounced. Independent grocery stores and smaller manufacturers often adjust prices faster than larger corporations due to lower inventory levels. These dynamics highlight how prolonged tariffs, if they return, could disproportionately impact smaller players in the market. A PYMNTS report released earlier this week showed “about half of SMBs rely on immediate sales or existing cash for survival, with business credit cards — which are not a working capital solution — being the most common form of financing for those with access,” PYMNTS wrote recently. ”SMBs with access to some method of financing demonstrate greater confidence in navigating economic challenges.” The challenges extend to middle-market companies where — per additional PYMNTS Intelligence research — 60% of CFOs expect the tariffs to bring about additional economic uncertainty and planning challenges. The research also found that almost 70% of finance chiefs foresee supply shortages and product delays, with a similar share executing new costs to restructure their supply chains. Experts agree that if tariffs had stayed in place, consumers would have faced significant price increases across various sectors: Groceries: Yale University’s Budget Lab estimated food prices would rise by 2.8% overall, with fresh produce increasing by 4%. Lower-income households would bear the brunt of these hikes as they allocate a larger share of their income to essentials. Clothing: Apparel prices were expected to climb within three to six months due to higher costs for imported textiles and manufacturing inputs. Back-to-school shopping could have become notably more expensive. Electronics: Items like smartphones and laptops, which are heavily reliant on China-manufactured components, would likely see steep price hikes under the 125% tariff rate, which is still in place. Although it has become something of an internet meme, the exponential increases in iPhone prices if they were manufactured in the U.S. is an example. These increases would not only strain household budgets but also contribute to broader inflationary pressures. Economists warned that sustained tariffs could reduce GDP growth by 0.6% annually and cost the economy $80–110 billion per year. Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday in an interview with CBS News that Chinese tariffs could create a “category 5 price storm” for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of “flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,” he added. The temporary freeze has reignited debates on how tariffs should be handled moving forward. Gina Bolvin of Bolvin Wealth Management emphasized that clarity in trade policy is essential for market stability. She described the pause as a “pivotal moment” but cautioned against celebrating prematurely given ongoing uncertainties. Bolvin said the timing also “couldn’t be better” given major financial institutions including Bank of New York Mellon, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday. “This pause may provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,” Bolvin added. John Canavan from Oxford Economics noted that unilateral tariff policies create significant risks for global commerce. He advocated for negotiated agreements rather than abrupt policy shifts that destabilize markets. “There have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,” Canavan said. “Given what’s been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.” Other developments before the tariff reversal showed how companies were prepared to deal not only with increased costs but from the uncertainty of the tariff drama. New tariffs on low-value packages from China could hinder the plans of Shein and Temu. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 8), the White House has upped duties on those packages to 90% of their value, or a flat fee of $75 that would increase to $150. The duty goes into effect May 2, with the flat-fee hike happening after June 1. The shift follows Trump’s closing of a loophole that allowed Chinese imports under the “de minimis” threshold of $800 to arrive duty-free. Walmart announced it was pulling its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. “The range of outcomes for Q1 operating income growth has widened due to less favorable category mix, higher casualty claims expense and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented,” the retail giant said in a news release Wednesday. Walmart had forecast operating income of 0.5% to 2% for the first quarter when it released fourth-quarter earnings result in February. The company is scheduled to release its full earnings May 15. Walmart said it expects first-quarter sales growth to be in line with a 3% to 4% outlook, with annual sales and operating income growth guidance unchanged, per the release, timed to coincide with the company’s Investment Community Meeting. Thousands of Canadian autoworkers were furloughed before the tariffs were rolled back. Now, Canada’s largest private-sector union is warning these temporary layoffs could be the beginning of larger troubles for the sector, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs,” Unifor President Lana Payne said, per the report. “The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see. My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” Around 6,000 Unifor members were laid off temporarily after Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on most countries, the report said. The bulk of those notices went to workers at a Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, and which shut down for two weeks as the carmaker examines the impact of the tariffs, according to the report. Amazon reportedly canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries. The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen. It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments. About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Title: Potential buyers are probing Yahoo’s ad tech assets

Yahoo has held preliminary talks with investment banks and potential buyers of its demand-side platform, according to sources familiar with the developments. Yahoo officially turned 30 last month, and in its trailblazing pomp of the 1990s and early 2000s, it was known as “the gateway to the internet.” However, in recent years, its various owners and leadership teams have had different ideas on monetizing its assets. Under its current ownership, Apollo Global Management – the private equity giant that took over Yahoo in 2021 – this could include a future without ad tech assets, with suitors inquiring about its DSP in recent weeks. While the latest developments do not amount to a formal sales process — Digiday understands all such recent discussions have resulted from inbound inquiries — they indicate an appetite for further ad tech consolidation. Four separate sources, all of whom requested anonymity to maintain relationships, told Digiday Yahoo had contemplated the prospect of a potential sale of its DSP for some time, even if this was just a case of scenario planning. However, since the start of early 2025, speculation over such divestiture has become more palpable, with two separate sources informing Digiday that investment bankers have been jockeying to engineer such a deal. One source told Digiday that preliminary discussions with a competitive DSP – the source declined to name this party – took place in recent weeks, although such talks are understood to have since ceased. When Digiday approached them for comment, spokespeople for Apollo Global Management and Yahoo declined to comment on the record about such assertions. When Apollo Global paid U.S. telco Verizon $5 billion to take ownership of Yahoo in 2021, it inherited a full suite of ad tech tools. However, it has since significantly reduced such interests, including the 2023 closure of its supply-side platform, a process that involved significant layoffs. Instead, Yahoo has inked a long-term partnership with Taboola, whereby the latter party powers native advertising across Yahoo’s digital properties. More recently, Yahoo appears to have doubled down on its efforts to monetize its remaining ad tech asset, inking partnerships with Kroger, being first to market with transparency standards and placing it front-and-center of sales pitches at major trade shows. It is difficult to officially rank the industry’s top DSPs primarily because Google (the widely presumed market leader) doesn’t break out DV360’s earnings, although it is understood to be a “tier one” player along with The Trade Desk and Amazon. Yahoo is understood to be among the chasing pack – also in this cohort are players such as Adform, MediaMath, Nexxen, Quantcast, StackAdapt, Viant and Xandr – with its DSP understood to be growing in stature. Advertiser Perceptions data recently shared with Digiday suggests media buyers are increasingly eager to diversify the number of DSPs they work with, and many are eager to reduce their reliance on Big Tech offerings. Robert Webster, founder and CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, told Digiday the Yahoo DSP is widely regarded as one of the best independent “feature-led DSPs.” He added, “If you look at it, for the first time in 10 years, the market is wide open… the DSP space is going to be transformed by AI in the next two years.” Sources consulted by Digiday claimed the most likely parties interested in the Yahoo DSP would either be competitors attempting to gain market share through consolidation or strategic players, such as a retail media network eager to add a buying tool to its stack. LUMA Partners CEO Terence Kawaja noted how mergers between sector rivals are rare occurrences, although he did note that much of the recent M&A activity in the space was driven by strategic acquirers. “All of the trends that drove that activity persist,” he added. “We still have the need for third- and first-party data… while the green shoots of AI and CTV also persist.” One anonymous source with knowledge of the developments said it was unlikely that another PE firm would buy the DSP without the data assets made available via Yahoo’s portfolio of web properties. “There’s probably not enough profitability for a PE to be that interested unless there’s a clear way of making cash, and if there was, then Apollo would have squeezed it out already, so it’s a tricky one,” added the source. Speaking with Digiday on the publication of LUMA Partners’ Q1 2025 market report, Conor McKenna, a partner at the investment bank, observed how T-Mobile’s ad tech acquisitions and Braze’s first scaled deal were notable throughout the period. He added, “Google announced a huge [$32 billion] deal [to buy Wiz],” he said, noting how this was the first such deal from a Big Tech player in some time. “I would interpret it as the expectation of a more conciliatory regulatory environment where they can potentially get big deals done.” However, given the current market uncertainty over the potential impact of tariff policies from the current U.S. administration, deal flow may be stalled in the coming months, according to LUMA Partners’s assessment. “Right now, we don’t know if that’s going to be a macro shock,” observed McKenna. “Right now, all we know is that there’s macro uncertainty.” Why companies would and wouldn’t want to buy a rising star in ad tech. All the holding companies have been interrogated as a result of guidelines that were issued by the ad agency association as well as the broadcasters’ association.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. U.S. professionals are fueled by the desire to progress professionally, especially when it comes to ... More upskilling in tech Remote work is not the only factor in a job that U.S. professionals care about. Even though many would be happy to exchange work benefits like PTO and health insurance for the ability to work remotely, according to FlexJobs, American workers are almost equally fueled by the desire to learn new skills so they can progress in their careers, making this a top priority when seeking new job opportunities. A recent discovery by LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report 2025 noted that learning new skills is high on the agenda for employers who wish to attract and retain top talent, with survey respondents citing this as their number one turnover reduction strategy. Additionally, LinkedIn reported more than a quarter of professionals who are seeking to learn new skills this year and are keen on progressing in their jobs. Consequently, LinkedIn revealed its popular list of the top 50 large workplaces for professional growth and development. The best part about this list is that all employers included in the ranking are currently hiring, with some hiring for hybrid-remote and fully remote roles. So you’ll be sure to find an opportunity that matches your interests. Here are the top 10 employers from LinkedIn’s Top Companies 2025 report: Why did these employers make the cut for this list, you might ask? LinkedIn evaluated these large companies--who each have about 5,000 or more employees to be eligible for inclusion in the list--based on qualities such as enabling their people to stay ahead with AI upskilling and development, and the development of technical skills-building pathways internally. Notably, in a signal move for bank JPMorganChase, about 70% “of roles for experienced hires--or candidates with full-time work experience--do not require a college degree,” LinkedIn noted, which means that the bank is yet another big-name employer to join the ranks of others such as IBM who have taken steps to abolish degree credential requirements from their roles and actively promote skills-based hiring. To get hired by top-tier employers like EY, PwC, or JPMorganChase, you need to be a top-tier candidate. That doesn’t mean you need to have graduated from an Ivy League college, or have a perfect, prestigious resume filled with your accomplishments at Big Four employers. But what this does mean is you’ll need to find ways to creatively differentiate yourself from the rest. Here are some top tips and an action plan to achieve this: These 10 companies are hiring right now, and they’re actively looking for someone like you who is proactive and passionate about continuous growth, aligning with industry shifts and trends, and climbing the next rung of professional development. Employers who prioritize skills-first hiring and internal upskilling will win in the talent ... More competition Despite many of these companies being at the forefront of headline layoffs this year, there are still thousands of positions up for grabs as they move towards a more efficient workforce. Are you ready to join them?

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. US extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X.

China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). Instead, GTRI said, India should consider a limited “Zero-to-Zero” tariff deal on 90 per cent of industrial goods, a model already offered by Europe to the U.S. Read more GTRI report warned that a full FTA with the US could turn out to be a costly mistake. While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month. Factory deflation persisted for a 30th month, with the producer-price index recording a faster drop of 2.5% compared to 2.2% in February. The Philippines has reached out to the U.S. Trade Representative to explore potential trade negotiations, with the best outcome being a free-trade agreement, the Economic Affairs minister said on Thursday after Washington said it would pause planned tariffs. “Let’s see what we can negotiate,” Frederick Go told a media briefing. ( Reuters) China lowers yuan midpoint for sixth day to 19-month low against dollar, signaling PBOC's focus on stability amid trade war. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday. ( Reuters) Trump pauses some tariffs, but not on auto imports, drawing criticism from Michigan business and auto groups. Trump's financial advice on social media led to a surge in stocks, raising questions about market manipulation. Understanding financial terms like capitulation, bear market, and dead cat bounce is crucial during economic uncertainty and market fluctuations. US stocks surge after Trump announces temporary tariff pause, easing fears of recession and boosting market confidence. U.S. dollar rebounds against safe-haven currencies after Trump announces tariff pause, escalating trade confrontation with China. Wall Street indexes surge after Trump announces tariff pause, with Dow up 5.76%, S&P 6.46%, Nasdaq 8.04%. President Trump eases tariffs on most nations for 90 days, raises tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day.

Bessent, speaking to an American Bankers Association conference in Washington, said he would take a lead negotiating role in negotiations over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that despite financial market turmoil, “in general, the companies I’ve spoken to, people who have come, the CEOs, who have come into Treasury, tell me that the economy is very solid.” - Reuters China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen US defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.

Please try again Silicon Valley companies, especially those that rely heavily on international supply chains, have seen their stocks drop precipitously since President Trump revealed his tariff plan on April 2. A 10% tariff on all imported goods went into effect on April 5 and higher tariffs on specific countries (like China and Mexico) are scheduled to begin on April 9. While it’s unclear whether all the tariffs are here to stay, companies are already acting as if Trump will deliver on his threats in the long term. More of Apple’s iPhones, famously constructed from parts sourced all over the world, may soon be assembled in India to sidestep Chinese tariffs that could raise the hardware cost of the iPhone 16 Pro by $300 each. Nintendo is delaying pre-orders for the new Switch 2 in the U.S. while it games out-market conditions. It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years. Missing from the public conversation, in news articles and social media, are the direct voices of tech company leaders. This is in large part due to fears of attracting negative attention from the Trump administration. “CEOs with large global supply chains can’t be outspoken on this topic publicly because they need to cut deals,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, wrote on social media platform X. “But this is the tone of the convos happening right now,” he added, reposting pointedly negative comments about the tariffs from tech analyst Dan Ives. “If these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold, there is no debate … it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner,” Ives wrote. Ives continued, “In one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs … and slow down US tech innovation.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.

Title: How Businesses Are Dealing With Impending Tariffs

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Tariffs have dominated the thoughts, discussions and decisions of business executives, investors and economists just about as soon as President Donald Trump took office. Hours after being sworn in on January 20, he announced his intention to start 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even though these tariffs were initially delayed a month, they took effect—and the world’s businesses knew Trump’s threats were solid. As much of the world prepares to begin paying new tariffs of at least 10% tomorrow, businesses have taken different steps to assess and control the impact on their businesses, revenues and sales. Klarna and StubHub were both planning to IPO, but decided to put their market debuts on hold due to ongoing volatility. Nintendo, already facing scrutiny for the higher-then-expected $449.99 price for its new Switch 2, decided to push back last Friday’s pre-order date for the game console, citing the need to better assess levies and market conditions. Volkswagen will add an “import fee” to cars sold in the U.S. starting later this month, the New York Times reports, and is holding off on imports while it figures out tariffs. Then there are companies and industries experts are confident can get through this period with few problems. Forbes’ Phoebe Liu writes Amazon is likely to do well, largely because it has the infrastructure already in place to shift pricing to consumers and sellers and deliver items quickly and efficiently. While Amazon’s prices are likely to take a hit, analysts told Liu, everyone else’s prices will experience the same, so Amazon will perform relatively well. The National Retail Federation also delivered a sanguine forecast for the industry, saying they expect no tariff-related changes to their annual forecast, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The retail group isn’t ignoring the impact of tariffs, and they acknowledge that consumer and business confidence may be dropping, but NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said it’s not time to count out the American consumer. As uncertainty persists, finance departments are looking to save their businesses money wherever possible. And even though fewer M&A transactions are going forward this year than predicted, some dealmaking is taking place. One area that’s often overlooked—and can be quite costly—is third-party service contracts. I talked to Nate Buniva, a partner at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe , about how not to lose money on contracts in a transaction. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. It’s spring break season and we’ll be taking next week off from Forbes CFO. We’ll be back on Tuesday, April 22. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Stocks rallied slightly Tuesday morning over a bit of optimism that Trump may be willing to cut tariff deals. He wrote on social media that he had a “great call” with South Korea’s Choi Sang-muk, and “China also wants to make a deal, badly.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on CNBC that he believes “we can end up with some good deals” if other companies come to the table. Regardless, Wall Street has not reacted well to the idea of tariffs. Since Trump’s announcement, the Nasdaq is down 8.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 7.8%, and the S&P 500 is down 8.3% Warnings are incoming from many economists and banks. JPMorgan Chase issued 60% odds of a recession, labeling Trump’s policies as the “largest tax increase” since 1968, which will “fall heavily on the US consumer.” Goldman Sachs increased their recession odds to 45% on Sunday, and cautioned that unless Trump capitulated, recession is their baseline economic forecast. UBS Investment Bank chief strategist Bhanu Baweja described the economic issue with tariffs as “a manmade problem, concentrated really around one man.” And if Trump were to change his mind, “suddenly the whole algebra changes.” Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov surveyed 50 top Wall Street investors, more than half of whom initially supported Trump’s policies, and found that their confidence in him is gone. Nearly three-quarters say his plan has been ineffective, and 54% of former supporters say he is failing. At the very least, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman, Trump’s tariffs are risking the U.S.’s reputation as a stable and predictable global partner for trade and investment—something that might be extremely difficult to get back in the years when Trump is out of office. Federal employees rally in support of their jobs last month outside a federal building in Chicago. Unemployment is climbing, according to figures from the Labor Department last week. In March, the U.S. added 228,000 non-farm jobs, more than economists’ estimates of 140,000. But unemployment was up to 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% forecasts. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a 60% increase in March layoffs, with more than 275,000 jobs eliminated last month. Nearly 80% of those cuts were in federal government jobs through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Last month’s numbers were the highest since Covid-19 pandemic-related cuts in spring 2020. Court orders have directed the federal government to rehire more than 26,000 of those terminated employees so far, but the government is continuing to appeal and most of the employees appear to be on paid administrative leave for the time being, CBS reports. However, Trump continuously touts his tariffs as a job creator: Companies will be drawn to start manufacturing products in the U.S. again, so they will build factories that will employ Americans. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that’s an inaccurate way to look at the situation. Manufacturing has always been alive and well in the U.S., and the industry is at record-high levels from a productivity standpoint. Many items that are not manufactured in the U.S. today are inexpensive or commodity products, which is keeping with the country’s development as technology improves. Even if lower-level manufacturing comes back to the U.S. as a result of tariffs, it takes years to plan, build and staff a factory, so changes are years away. A sign at a Capital One Café in Miami. The $35 billion merger of Capital One and Discover made it past the Justice Department’s antitrust review, bringing the deal closer to the finish line, according to multiple reports. When the deal was first announced in February 2024, many analysts questioned if it would go through. President Joe Biden’s administration halted several mergers for antitrust reasons, including JetBlue’s planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and Kroger’s planned purchase of Albertsons. The New York Times reports that in January, before Trump’s inauguration, Biden’s Justice Department had drafted an interim memo that outlined concerns that the Capital One-Discover tie-up could harm consumers. The merger is not a done deal yet. It still needs approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analysts believe the Justice Department would be the most likely to object; the Times writes the Federal Reserve hasn’t denied a bank merger application since 2003. But if this goes through, it’s the first big financial deal that will have made it through the Trump Administration’s brand of scrutiny. Nate Buniva, partner at West Monroe. Every business has third-party contracts for services and IT platforms, which can often be forgotten during an M&A transaction. Nate Buinva, a partner at management and technology consulting firm West Monroe, is an expert at paying attention to these contracts—which he said can save 40% to 60% in a transaction if managed correctly. I talked to him about how to properly handle third-party contracts on both sides of an M&A deal. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Are there any types of contracts that tend to be overlooked more than others? Buniva: It’s a lot of work to read the T’s and C’s of these large enterprise agreements and understand what it can mean from a dollars and cents perspective. Often the contract piece does get overlooked or just not talked about. It’s like: This is what we spend on our ERP, this is what we spend on our collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams, but there’s not always that double click of: In this merger, do we have the right to terminate one agreement and get [the new entity] on the other, or are we going to be held with double cost? Reading through these legal documents is not the most exciting, and M&A transactions move quickly, too. You have to do the 80/20 rule, and get up to speed quickly on what you have, and make educated decisions to move forward. Is there anything that companies planning to be involved in an M&A transaction in the near future should consider when they get into contracts? Absolutely. You want to put in clauses that contemplate where you have the ability to scale the way you can structure your pricing in a tiered fashion, whereas volume goes up, you see a preferred discount on a per-unit level. Let’s say you currently only have 100 service requests right now, and you would do a tier that would take you up into the thousands. The reason you’re tiering it so high, when you do acquire a new company, you are already set up with your existing providers at a price point that says: I want you to honor this discount because I’m bringing you this extra volume. You don’t want to be in a position of doing that acquisition and you’re paying the 100-unit rate, but your volume’s 1,000. You can put in change-of-control language that says pricing or the terms need to be reevaluated if there is a change of control and you’re being sold off or absorbed. Even if you're not contemplating a transaction in the future, you never know what’s going to happen. You may as well put it in. More and more vendors are open to that because in general, yes, they may have to provide more discounted pricing, but they want the additional volume. What advice would you give to a CFO on either side of a transaction? It takes a dedicated team. My guidance is to make sure you’ve cleared people's bandwidth internally and do a review of your third-party agreements. I would also recommend they bring in an expert externally to look at this stuff and build an inventory. Oftentimes, your procurement, IT or finance orgs don’t necessarily have the subject matter expertise. Your legal team will know what contractual rights you’ll have, but they don’t know where the market is on what you can negotiate out of or what tools you can use. Every department has their own contracts. If you don’t have it, build a centralized database. You’re going to want to look at when does the contract end? How much are you spending? What’s the service? Do you have termination rights? As you contemplate the transaction, you need to start talking with the other entity about what they have and where there’s overlap, or if you're being sold off, what gaps will you have as a new entity where you need to now go stand up your own agreements. All of that takes a lot of time and runway, so the other piece of advice is do it ASAP. Where you don’t want to be—and this is when we’ve been called in the past—is at the end hour: Oh my gosh, we’re going to be a standalone company next month. We don’t have a Microsoft agreement. We can do that, but if it had been a more thoughtful journey, then you can get better pricing, terms, service levels, all of that stuff across all of your services. Oftentimes CFOs are focused on what’s the cost synergy, the headcount reduction or the opportunity to scale this business? But third-party spend is a huge component of that. Elon Musk, who is slashing government spending through DOGE, has spoken out against tariffs. Forbes’ John Hyatt examines how much Musk’s business empire has to lose through the new taxes levied by Trump. 20%-25%: Proportion of car parts Tesla imported last year from nations excluding Canada. About 40% of battery materials come from Chinese suppliers $68 million: Value of a Starlink contract canceled by Ontario Premier Doug Ford in response to Trump’s trade war. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, does business in more than 125 countries ‘Economic Armageddon’: How Dan Ives, global head of technology research for Wedbush Securities, described the tariffs’ impact on the automobile industry, including Tesla As DOGE rampages through the federal government, billions of dollars in grant money and contracts are being cut. Here are 10 things all federal contractors should do, both those who are seeing funding canceled and those who may yet be on the chopping block. Even though many CFOs and CIOs say they work well together as a unified team, there are often serious differences when it comes to ownership and ROI for tech investments, and that can lead to botched tech rollouts. Here are some tips to improve that relationship for maximum success. Last week, a CEO used profanity on a live interview with CNBC as he reacted to his company’s stock price falling after a poor earnings report and Trump’s tariff announcement. In the days since, this CEO has said the tariffs will actually help his company. Which company does he lead? A. BlackBerry B. Restoration Hardware C. Penguin Solutions D.

Rushes Extra goes beyond the headlines to take a closer look at developing stories from throughout the film world. Photographs by Eleanor Petry. On the afternoon of March 7, a cold and blustery Friday in New York, about twenty people march in a neat ellipse on the sidewalk outside the Lower Manhattan location of Alamo Drafthouse, the American dine-in cinema chain. As more Alamo workers arrive to join the picket, they take signs from a nearby handcart, most of them handwritten on cardboard or on the back of all-purpose placards printed by United Auto Workers, the union with which Alamo United has been affiliated since the fall of 2023. References to movies occasionally appear: “‘I can do this all day.’ –Captain America,” “Sony make Alamo Do the Right Thing,” “Sony thought I was mad about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sequels.” Just blocks from the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, chants echo off of the limestone edifices of capital. “Exploitation ain’t the way / Alamo workers need fair pay!” “Sony corporate, you can’t hide / You committed labor crimes!”; “Who runs the Alamo? / We run the Alamo!” On January 14, Alamo Drafthouse announced mass layoffs across the company, letting go of nine percent of its corporate staff (fifteen employees of 165) as well as an unspecified number of part-time hourly employees at its 42 venues on a last-in, first-out basis. At its Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn locations alone, 70 people were laid off. One month later, Alamo workers at the Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan locations went on strike to protest the layoffs. They are asking would-be cinemagoers to refrain from attending screenings at Alamo during the strike, and for Alamo members to cancel their subscriptions. (When contacted about this piece, Alamo management declined to comment.) As the numbers on the sidewalk swell, Anthony Squitire—a server and trainer at the Brooklyn Alamo Drafthouse for three and a half years, and a member of the NYC Alamo United bargaining committee—delivers a speech, reading off handwritten loose sheafs of yellow legal-pad paper. “Everyone suffers under the pursuit of unattainable profit margins,” he hollers. “There are only two things in this world that seek to grow exponentially to selfish and lethal ends: capitalism and cancer.” Squitire goes on to condemn the Alamo management representatives who insist their workers’ demands for health and safety protections, formalized disciplinary procedures, and increased pay on holidays are unrealistic while Sony Pictures executives “pop champagne with celebrities in our hallways, spend $10K on gifts for Oscar nominees, and make hundreds of billions off the PlayStation 5 alone.” He specifically identifies Kelley Bondelie, VP of Operations at Alamo, and Jennifer Yarbrough, Chief People Officer, claiming that they log on to Zoom bargaining sessions with “sweaters wrapped around their necks” and “twenty-foot in-ground pools” in the background. “Today marks three weeks of our strike,” Squitire concludes. “We are stronger than ever, and we will fight until the bitter end.” Founded in Austin, Texas, in 1997 by Tim and Karrie League as a one-screen second-run theater, Alamo Drafthouse quickly made a name for itself as an independently-operated cinema dedicated to elevating the theatrical experience with food-and-drink service (including alcohol) and well-curated programming. The theater garnered early notices from hometown filmmaking heroes like Richard Linklater and Robert Rodriguez; in 1999, Quentin Tarantino moved his then-annual QT Fest, at which he screened selections from his personal print collection, from the Dobie Theatre to the Alamo. With its kooky preshow attractions, special celebrity guest appearances, and strictly enforced “no talking” policy, Alamo generated a cult-like reputation as a place run by and for contemporary film enthusiasts. By 2010, Alamo had begun to expand beyond Texas as part of a national dine-in cinema boom. Since the mid-to-late aughts, competing chains had been taking up its business model, offering premium concessions to mitigate flagging theater attendance. Today, major theater chains like AMC and Regal Cinemas offer full bar service, multiple dine-in theaters have sprung up around the country, and Alamo operates 42 locations in ten states and Washington, D.C., with plans to expand further. When the COVID-19 lockdowns began in March 2020, Alamo closed most of its locations and furloughed about 80 percent of its theater employees; four months later, it laid off more than 80 corporate employees. In March 2021, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it failed to service approximately $105 million in debt. A couple months later, Alamo emerged from bankruptcy with Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group as its new owners. In August 2020, the Department of Justice lifted the Paramount Consent Decrees, which had prevented film distributors from owning and controlling exhibition companies since 1948. “Because changes in antitrust law and administration have diminished the importance of the Decrees’ restrictions, while still providing protections that will keep the probability of future violations low, the Court finds that termination of the Decrees is in the public interest,” wrote US District Judge Analisa Torres in her decision. In June 2024, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired Alamo, making it the first Hollywood studio to own a theater chain in over 75 years. Mass deregulation and weakened antitrust laws paved the way for American cinema to become even more consolidated and monopolized than it was before. Michael Kustermann, the current CEO of Alamo Drafthouse, is also the head of “Sony Pictures Experiences.” In recent years, several New York City cinemas have unionized as a way to bargain for higher wages and more equitable workplace policies. In 2019, BAM administrative workers and cinema staff at the Brooklyn Academy of Music voted to unionize. Anthology Film Archives employees went on a one-day strike on March 31, 2022, and voted to ratify their first contract two and a half months later. Film Forum workers voted unanimously in favor of unionization in June 2022 and ratified their first contract one year later. On July 21, 2023, the summer’s most hotly anticipated films, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer (both 2023), opened on the same day and made a combined $300 million. Their success was manna from heaven for a Hollywood still feeling the effects of the pandemic slump and its own labor strikes, but the opening weekend placed a heavy strain on theater employees nationwide, including and especially those working at Alamo Drafthouse, who are tasked with preparing and serving food and drinks on-demand throughout the shows, in addition to the usual responsibilities of an usher. It was after the infamous “Barbenheimer weekend” that workers at the Brooklyn and Manhattan Alamo Drafthouses began to collectively organize. Though League stepped down as Alamo’s CEO to become chairman of the board in May 2020, he endures as a brand mascot for the company and a leading industry figure, having gone on to cofound Neon, an Oscar-winning production and distribution company. Alamo management brought him in to encourage workers at the Brooklyn Alamo not to unionize in the fall of 2023. During a meeting, an audio recording of which was obtained by the Associated Press, League insisted that a union would drive a wedge between staff and management while proclaiming his progressive bona fides, like supporting Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential run. “I built this company to be the best damn cinema that has ever, or will ever, exist,” he told workers. “I personally feel strongly that inserting a union between you and me and the team hinders that goal.” Within days, on September 29, the Brooklyn Alamo voted to unionize. Two weeks later, on October 12, the Lower Manhattan Alamo did the same. Both cited a toxic culture of understaffing and exhaustion that was not being effectively addressed by management. “The whole point of a contract was for some modicum of consistency,” Squitire told Notebook over the phone in February. “It can't be that some days are easy, and some days I'm pulling my hair out in the walk-in and smoking six cigarettes because I'm on the verge of a panic attack. Unionizing was a matter of legally forcing corporate to listen to us when we tell them what they need for the business not to go under.” In the United States, businesses are legally required to negotiate layoffs with unions in the midst of contract bargaining, so they did not go into effect immediately at the company’s three unionized locations. In Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, NYC Alamo United is associated with UAW Local 2179; in Denver, Colorado, Alamo Collective joined Communication Workers of America (CWA) Local 7777. On January 31, after multiple negotiation sessions, when dozens of articles of contention were reportedly still on the table, management unilaterally declared an impasse on the layoffs issue. In response, the union filed an Unfair Labor Practice complaint to the National Labor Relations Board on February 3, the same day roughly twenty percent of the New York City workforce was laid off. NYC Alamo United had discussed the possibility of a strike if layoffs were imposed and had voted to approve one on January 30, the day before the impasse. Following a week of informational pickets, 175 New York workers agreed to walk out on February 14, the same day that 60 workers at the Sloans Lake location in Denver did. The holiday is typically a busy day for Alamo; this year it was also the beginning of a crucial opening weekend for Captain America: Brave New World and Paddington in Peru (both 2025). Conor Hall, who has worked as a server at the Brooklyn Alamo for three years, gave a passionate speech in the kitchen prior to the walkout that effectively rallied the troops. Gesturing wildly to his peers, he exclaims, “All of [you] wonderful people make this the number one Alamo in the country. This is how we remind corporate that it's not because of movies and popcorn. It's because of the people.” “All I had to do was recognize how I was feeling and how I was seeing my coworkers treated,” Hall told Notebook. “So all I could say was the truth, which is that the only way to send a message these days is as a unified voice. No one person can be heard in the din and clamor of corporate America, but if enough people come together and speak loudly enough, it's impossible to drown them out.” In Manhattan, the picketers, now about 45 strong and tailed by four relaxed police officers, wind their way noisily north, rounding the corner of City Hall Park at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge. Several unionists field questions from passersby and distribute leaflets about the layoffs featuring a menacing cartoon popcorn bucket holding kernels in either hand as though they might be bricks. When a Downtown Alliance pickup truck pulls up in the midst of its garbage-collection rounds, unionists hand leaflets to the curious men through the open window. As on the cinema floor, a division of labor takes root, though in this case it is self-selected. Someone leads the chants. Someone distributes snacks from a large backpack. Someone pushes the cart in which signs have been replaced with backpacks and water bottles. (Others help them to get its rickety wheels over every curb cut.) Bringing up the rear, one unionist wheels a piece of carry-on luggage with a neck pillow strung around the handle; he must proceed directly to the airport after the march, heading home for a funeral. Rosa Martinez, who has worked as a food runner at the Brooklyn Alamo for two years, told Notebook that most of their coworkers are also film workers of one kind or another. (In fact, they are taking advantage of the strike to work on the set of another worker’s film that weekend.) It’s no surprise that cinema workers would have creative passions beyond theater operations, but Martinez’s comment is a reminder of how the struggles at Alamo are intertwined with those of a larger industry in crisis. We’re still experiencing the longtail effects of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, which exacerbated concerns around the future of theatrical exhibition and human labor in Hollywood. Ariana Fatalia, a bartender who works both in front and back of house at the Brooklyn Alamo, was laid off and has been striking alongside her former colleagues since Valentine’s Day. She had been going to school for computer science at the City College of New York and informed venue management about her relatively limited availability during the winter months. Just as winter classes ended and her availability opened up, she learned she was on the list for layoffs. “Funny story about me, the place I worked for like five years was Amazon Whole Foods,” she told Notebook. “They wrongfully fired me, and I joined Alamo because I thought, It’s unionized, and this will never happen to me again. This will be the part-time job that will get me through college.” Ariana believes that the old Alamo would have only reduced people’s hours instead of resorting to layoffs, but that the Sony buyout changed the mandate. “Flexible scheduling was a big part of Alamo, and now everything’s completely changed,” she says. “This is all Alamo Drafthouse under Sony.” Jordan Baruch—a bargaining committee member and concierge shift lead who has worked at the Brooklyn Alamo since November 2022—insists that “one of the very significant things that is different about this year compared to the past years when Alamo didn’t lay anybody off in this quarter is that Sony now owns Alamo. I don't really see how that’s not a big part of the equation.” In previous years, Alamo would regularly reduce hours depending on seasonal market shifts, as film exhibitors expect to have busier and slower months. The company alleged low first-quarter projections as a reason for layoffs, rather than the usual reduction in hours. According to information shared with Notebook, Alamo has cut back on screenings and food service in response to the strike. Between spring and summer 2024, Alamo added five new screens to the Brooklyn location. It and the Lower Manhattan location are the chain’s two most profitable locations, according to internal ticket admission numbers. Currently, the Brooklyn Alamo is operating only seven of its twelve theaters due to the strike. For the first week and a half, showtimes were marked “sold out” on the app when they reached roughly 50 percent capacity. As the sun wanes on the afternoon of March 7, the picket passes Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street encampment. It passes the Bowling Green Bull, where tourists turn their phones and cameras to the march, a mixture of impassivity and confusion playing across their faces. The unionists weave through sculptural roadblocks and come to a stop in front of the Trump Building, which was built in 1930 to house the earliest progenitor of JPMorgan Chase, the largest American bank; the lease was sold to Donald Trump’s company in 1995. “We’re going in,” someone murmurs, but they do not. Instead, Brooks Cline—member of the bargaining committee and guest attendant shift lead at the Lower Manhattan Alamo for three and a half years—unfolds another sheaf of yellow legal pad paper. He denounces Alamo management for the layoffs and their “inhumanity and disregard for working-class people” before putting their struggle into context with the rising tides of reactionism: Cline concludes his speech by reiterating that the unionists are out in the streets for all the people whom Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Elon Musk have declared a war against. “We are marching out here for workers everywhere—workers of color, trans workers, migrant workers, workers of all circumstances chronically stymied by the hammer of capitalism. We are marching because we are united against corporate greed in all its forms.” As he tucks his paper back into his pocket, the chants resume: “No Trump, no KKK / No fascist USA.” NYC Alamo United has been on strike for nearly two months. Meanwhile, the parallel strike in Denver ended after just four days. According to Josh Reitze—a member of the CWA bargaining committee who has worked in the kitchen at the Sloans Lake Alamo since 2022—their union had always planned on a brief walkout, a strategy they shared with New York ahead of time. “We did not intend to stay out indefinitely,” he says. “This is our first strike. Not everybody is able to strike for the same amount of time; not everybody has the same level of agitation to sustain a strike for as long as New York has. I commend them wholeheartedly for keeping their strike going, but we wanted something more targeted for our first big action.” Reitze believes their strike was a success in terms of “organizational maturity,” as he has witnessed a rise in participation and engagement within the shop, though it remains to be seen whether any gains will be reflected in future bargaining sessions. Reitze received assurances from management that the laid-off Sloans Lake workers will be offered their jobs back, but that has yet to materialize and he admits that general progress in contract negotiations has slowed to a crawl. In New York, Baruch has been in the bargaining sessions since contract negotiations began in January 2024, and he says that management has been dismissive of union proposals from the start. “We've been through three different [management] law firms over the course of this union fight,” he says. “They've been using Ogletree Deakins now for the longest, and their playbook is to decline or reject proposals that mean a lot to the contract and not give a reason why or just to shrug. The workers themselves will tell them what it takes to adequately staff our locations with long speeches that are very from the heart. They just ignore what we say and essentially put their heads face down on the table.” Two bargaining sessions have taken place since the strike began. Baruch believes the March 3 session was particularly productive in terms of contract negotiation and working toward reinstatement of the terminated workers. Despite high hopes after the demonstration, the union was disappointed by the tenor of the subsequent session on March 10, three days later. As the strike nears the end of its second month, with workers on the picket line most days of the week, the unionists are keenly aware of how important maintaining morale and momentum will be in the days ahead. Baruch invokes a few recent positive developments: a food drive secured donations for striking workers, and a public screening of Brett Story and Stephen Maing’s Union (2024), which documents the Amazon Labor Union’s efforts to unionize a Staten Island warehouse, doubled as a successful fundraiser for Alamo United. He also mentions that some strikers have started to receive unemployment insurance. With that money in addition to the strike assistance fund, some people might end up making more money on strike than they would working at Alamo two or three shifts a week due to the slow season. “That's not why we did it,” Baruch insists, “but it’s part of the calculus of how people are still thinking about the strike and their personal decisions about whether or not they want to continue or advocate for us to end prematurely.” Fatalia, the bartender and computer-science student, says that she’s made everlasting bonds with the people on the picket line, and that whether or not she gets her job back, she’s willing to fight “to get rid of Sony's corporate greed.” Squitire believes that they’ve shown Alamo that they will “not accept them flagrantly breaking federal labor law” and they “we will make them hurt if they try to make us hurt.” The next bargaining session is scheduled for April 11. Alamo management and the unionized workers remain functionally deadlocked, the former evidently hoping to sweat out the strike while the latter builds public support and discusses potential escalation. Meanwhile, union fervor has spread to other Alamo locations across the country. On March 25, the Slaughter Lane Alamo in Austin, Texas, the company’s hometown, delivered their demand for recognition with UAW to management. They also cited the layoffs as a reason for unionization. Regardless of what happens in the future, Conor Hall believes that they’ve made an impact on the public and the company: “What I know is that we stood together and we made it known that it was unfair, it was cruel, and if nothing else, we show that we can do this. If nothing else, we fucking did it, dude. That's the message.” Additional reporting by Maxwell Paparella. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.

Title: Shopify's Toby Lütke doubles down on his hardcore 2025 messaging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-toby-lutke-efficiency-mandatory-messaging-internal-memo-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke is going all in on hardcore tech messaging. In a memo to employees that he posted on X on Monday, Lütke wrote: "In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify." "This sounds daunting, but given the nature of the tools, this doesn't even sound terribly ambitious to me anymore," Lütke wrote, referring to artificial intelligence. The memo — titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation" — directed employees to ramp up their AI usage at the Canadian e-commerce firm. Lütke said using the technology is "now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify" and that AI usage would be gauged in performance and peer review questionnaires. He added that the expectations apply to himself and all executives as well. The CEO appears to be reversing his reputation as a founder who values work-life balance. Last month, in response to an X post that touted him as an example of balancing work and family, Lütke wrote: "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend. I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Lütke has since deleted most of his 2019 tweets, including one that said: "I've never worked through a night. The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so. I need 8ish hours of sleep a night. Same with everybody else, whether we admit it or not." In 2023, Lütke restricted Shopify employees from having side hustles, saying the company required their "unshared attention." The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Shopify CEO's remarks reflect a broader cultural crackdown on Big Tech workers, who have enjoyed a work culture known for office perks, top-line pay, and job security, sometimes without grueling hours. Across the industry, free massages and football tables have been replaced with messaging around "efficiency" and "scrappiness and frugality." At tech giants like Amazon and TikTok, pandemic-era work-from-home luxuries have been replaced by strict return-to-office mandates. At nearly every company, layoffs have taken a wrecking ball to the industry and AI adoption has cut hiring, making job security a thing of the past. "We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his RTO memo in September. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration." Workers who spoke to Business Insider said they are feeling the pressure to work longer hours, go beyond what is asked of them, be highly visible, and evaluate other options beyond full-time work.

Title: SSA reorg plan contemplates field office closures, contradicting public statements

Two people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit. Jim West / UCG / Universal Images Group / Getty Images Stay Connected Erich Wagner and Natalie Alms Updated April 7 at 8:27 p.m. ET A draft plan for service delivery at the Social Security Administration includes “field office consolidation” as a goal for next year — even as the agency maintains publicly that it isn’t closing field offices. SSA posted Monday on X that it “is NOT permanently closing field offices. Only underutilized hearing office space has been closed and without permanently closing field offices.” But a plan circulating within the agency includes a goal to “further reduce footprint” in 2026 and beyond. The scope of the envisioned "consolidations" is unclear, though the document singles out field offices as on the chopping block next year. This comes after billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency posted information about nearly 50 field offices it was planning to shutter. SSA has said that news reports about plans to close field offices are incorrect. The draft plan, originally sent March 21 and obtained by Government Executive, is required by the Trump administration by April 14 as part of its push to gut the federal workforce and reorganize agencies. Asked for comment Monday, SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann wrote, "There is no validity to this claim." At the same time the agency is contemplating plans to shutter offices, it also is moving ahead with new identity proofing requirements expected to push more people to those offices. SSA is ending phone service for many of its benefits applications, as well as those looking to make changes to their direct deposit information, leaving them with online or in-person avenues to do so. Some regional leaders that oversee field offices still haven’t gotten guidance on implementing the changes, which are scheduled to take place next week, according to one current employee. SSA is also looking to shed thousands of employees. The March 21 document says that the agency plans to cut 5,500 employees by the end of the fiscal year as part of the agency’s plan to get down to 50,000 employees, as Government Executive previously reported. Martin O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during the final year of President Biden’s term, said that several elements of the plan, including further consolidations of the agency’s phone systems under Amazon Web Services and the development of a “digital service index” that elucidates which agency services can be conducted by phone, online or in-person, were already under discussion during his tenure. But none of it can be effectively done while reducing staff at the agency, which is already at a half-century low. “Except for the butchering of an agency that has already been reduced to a 50-year low in staffing, many of these things were things we had put into motion during my team, and some of it reflects the good work of the Office of Transformation ... A lot of those things should happen, but none will make up for the gutting the staff at this already depleted agency with a chainsaw,” he said. One operations component that formerly had about 400 feds now has only half that number, one current SSA employee told Government Executive. The office, a recent creation of what used to be two components, handles both operations support as well as some technology functions. “With the Regional offices gutted… no one will be left to support field offices when they have difficulty,” said the employee. Rich Couture, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees’ SSA General Committee, said he was alarmed to see the plan mention a hiring freeze at the agency, when Trump’s hiring freeze executive order specifically exempted employees who work on the delivery of Social Security benefits. He also noted that the reassignment of employees from regional and headquarters offices to frontline work constitutes a brain drain, both from those back-of-house components and from the frontline workforce. “From the union’s perspective, it made no sense to offer buyouts and early retirement to experienced frontline staff just to turn around and fill those vacancies with people who have no frontline experience, who will need months of training and years of on-the-job experience to become proficient in these complex programs,” Couture said. “And in order to train them, you need to take staff off the frontline to do so. It was an easily avoidable problem.” Couture said he too has heard concerns from frontline workers about the potential impact of the regional office consolidations and reassignments on the support employees in field offices and hearings offices need to do their jobs. “A lot of these components have positions that don’t make sense to put in a field office or a hearing office–you wouldn’t put an HR staffer into one of these offices, because it makes sense to have these staffed regionally and centrally,” he said. “One of the big concerns I’ve heard from employees of late is: What happens if all of these HR personnel are reassigned or RIFed and there’s not enough people to do the job, and then I decide at a later date that I want to retire or need to take some action with my insurance? That hasn’t been fleshed out yet.” SSA intends to push people online, the plan notes, by expanding what the public can do online with SSA, as opposed to going to an office in person or calling. Recently, however, people looking to reach the agency online have seen system outages as a result of new anti-fraud checks at the agency. The agency has also warned staff in its Office of the Chief Information Officer — which handles the agency's tech and is being led by a DOGE associate — of coming layoffs, calling the office's work "not mission critical,” one SSA employee told Government Executive. The agency says that it wants to ramp up the use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle calls. It hopes to use technology more broadly “to serve our increasing customer base with fewer employees,” the plan notes, including by fully automating the processing of most retirement and Medicare claims. O’Malley said the combination of increased anti-fraud measures–for an agency whose error rate is already under 1%–and funneling more people into online and AI-powered service lanes will crush the public’s faith in the agency. “There are things we could do to improve the level of customer service and ease of transaction for citizens and customers, but eliminating half the staff of the IT department is not one of those things and closing field offices is not one of those things,” he said. “Shutting down portals that had worked, whether online or via phone, to drive more people into the field offices–those are the things that actually destroy and degrade customer service, that appear designed to sour the public against the agency by cramming them into field offices.” Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the plans surrounding Medicare claims.
