Four years ago, Robin Thurston, a new owner of Outside, hosted an introductory meeting with the staff of the magazine. Thurston, a tech entrepreneur and a former semi-professional cyclist, Zoomed in from Boulder, where he lives. Much of the staff gathered in the magazine’s offices, in downtown Santa Fe, eager for a glimpse of their new boss. The feeling in the room was hopeful. Like many media products, the magazine had been struggling. The thick print issues of the nineties, fat with ads for Patagonia and Land Rover, had become notably slimmer. Some employees had been furloughed to cut down on costs, and Outside had developed a reputation for not paying freelancers in a timely manner. But it was still publishing award-winning journalism, and had a solid reputation founded on decades of literary and investigative journalism. Around the industry, investors were buying distressed media companies; as far as new owners went, Thurston seemed like a good fit, the kind of guy who was happy to have a meeting that was also a bike ride—if you could keep up with him. “The guy’s a hammer,” one staffer told me. Thurston had sold his first company, MapMyFitness, to Under Armour, in 2013. By the time he purchased Outside, he had already raised more than a hundred and fifty million dollars from venture-capital firms, including Sequoia Heritage, to create a digital hub for the outdoors. He had bought roughly a dozen titles—Backpacker, SKI, Climbing, and Yoga Journal among them—under the umbrella of Pocket Outdoor Media. Outside, the largest in circulation and in prestige, could be the centerpiece. Thurston told the staff that he was changing the name of the company from Pocket Outdoor Media to Outside Interactive, Inc. It was an encouraging step, one that felt like a true commitment. In February, however, Outside, Inc., announced its third round of layoffs in as many years. Nearly the entire Outside editorial team that was in place at the time of the acquisition has now left, transitioned to non-editorial roles, or been laid off. A handful of full-time staffers edit the website; the print magazine, once a monthly but now a quarterly, has just one full-time dedicated editor. In response to the latest layoffs, a group of thirty-six contributing editors, writers, and photographers—including Tim Cahill, E. Jean Carroll, Ian Frazier, Hampton Sides, and Jimmy Chin—signed a letter requesting that their names be removed from the masthead. Some of the signatories had been around for Outside’s seventeen-year run of National Magazine Award nominations (including three consecutive wins for General Excellence), and the publication of stories that became best-selling books, including “The Perfect Storm” and “Into Thin Air,” and movies, including “Blue Crush.” “Your company now seems intent on destroying what Outside once stood for,” the group wrote in an e-mail, on March 10th. (I have written a handful of pieces for Outside’s website, the most recent of which was published in 2019.) “There is this magazine—or there was this magazine—that was a liberating thing, that had a history, and there were all these people who just cared. They really cared so much about it,” Sides told me. In response, Thurston reiterated the company’s “commitment to meaningful storytelling” amid a “changing media landscape” and “substantial headwinds in the media market that impact advertising, subscription, and e-commerce.” But, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former editors, writers, and executives, most of whom requested anonymity—either because they had signed non-disparagement agreements or they feared retaliation—mismanagement and a number of missteps have made a challenging situation worse. “I think there was a fundamental lack of direction or understanding from the C-suite as to what any of these magazines were, why the audiences cared about them or subscribed, and what it takes to tell a good story,” a former employee told me. (Outside, Inc., disputes a number of characterizations in this article, including the idea that in-depth reporting—which a representative claimed “remains fundamental”—is no longer a priority.) Outside was founded, in 1977, by Jann Wenner, who brought on collaborators who had worked with him at Rolling Stone, which he had co-founded ten years previously; they hoped to capitalize on the growing interest in outdoor activities and adventure travel. At the time, there were other publications focussed on the outdoors—Field & Stream had a circulation of nearly two million—but they tended to be either technical and insidery or scandalous and tabloidy. David Quammen, a prominent contributor to Outside, recalled Cahill, a founding editor, referring to the latter as “Jaguars rip my flesh” stories. The magazine saw itself as literary but not self-serious; if the stereotypical National Geographic story was a walk through the jungle recounted in hushed, awed tones, its Outside equivalent was a little dustier, wilder, and less reverent. “Outside always had the feeling that it was apart from the Washington and New York journalism community—it’s there in the name. It was always westward-leaning—you know, getting outside, getting away from big cities, living your life, environmentalism and conservation,” Sides said. “There was always a contrarian aspect to it.” In 1978, Wenner sold the magazine to Larry Burke, a young man from Chicago who had spent a chunk of his twenties vagabonding around Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Burke eventually moved the magazine’s headquarters from Chicago to Santa Fe, where staffers worked out of an adobe-style building with two wood-burning fireplaces and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The magazine’s remit was broad: writers covered mountaineering and triathletes, rodeo queens and road trips. Outside sent Susan Orlean to Spain to meet with a female matador, and Don Katz to Yorkshire to profile a man who held the world record for keeping a ferret in his pants the longest. Quammen, who wrote Outside’s natural-science column for fifteen years, told me, “I would write an essay about something really kind of fringe, like, What’s the sense of identity of a spoon worm? What are the redeeming merits of a mosquito? You know, various weird shit. And the editors, God bless them, would print the stuff.” Mark Bryant was Outside’s editor-in-chief in the nineties, years that seem golden mostly in retrospect. “The business was hard, the work was hard, but it was more straightforward,” Bryant told me. “We could focus on the business at hand, putting out a great magazine for readers, and not, you know, content bundling and data aggregation.” Baby boomers were discovering an apparently bottomless appetite for outdoor sports and adventure travel. The magazine benefitted from this surge in interest, even as some writers expressed misgivings about it. The article that became “Into Thin Air” was an example of this ambivalence. Bryant assigned Jon Krakauer to cover the rapid commercialization of Mt. Everest expeditions, sending him on a trip led by a guide who had agreed to accept the bulk of his fee in the form of future advertising in the magazine. That guide, Rob Hall, ended up dying on the mountain, along with seven other people. Krakauer, traumatized and exhausted, wrote a seventeen-thousand-word article within weeks. The story was memorably clear on the dangers that accompanied the increasing numbers of amateurs on Mt. Everest; the next year, demand for guided trips was higher than ever. Burke, the owner, was often a source of friction. According to former staffers, he was critical of hippies, dirtbag climbers, environmentalists, and stories about animals. But he was also immensely proud of the magazine. During the nineties, the famously stingy Burke rewarded star writers and editors with all-expenses-paid kayaking trips on the Salmon River. Through the years, Burke received multiple offers to sell Outside, but he was always resistant, even as the rise of the internet began to erode circulation and advertising income. At first, the larger audiences available online, especially through social media, made the trade-offs seem worthwhile. “We in the outdoor media—and the media, generally—were kind of selling our souls to the platforms for the distribution, because it was so easy and so cheap,” Christopher Jerard, an original staff member of Freeskier magazine and the current vice-president of marketing at Outside, Inc., said. “Then—surprise, surprise—they turned the spigot off, and we were left with no owned audiences.” By 2020, a person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission estimated, the print edition of the magazine had roughly half as many pages as a few decades earlier; Burke, nearing his eighties, finally decided to sell. When Pocket Outdoor Media began scooping up titles, many of them were still profitable or breaking even, with committed but declining audiences, according to sources familiar with the acquisitions. But Thurston seemed to have bigger ambitions than running a stable of small magazines that more or less broke even. In his initial meeting, he laid out a vision of Outside, Inc., as a tech-media empire, “the Amazon Prime for the active-life-style participant,” with subscription numbers akin to those of Disney+ or Netflix. Rather than depending on the volatile advertising market, the company would get recurring revenue via a membership program, Outside+, which would provide unlimited access to the magazines’ articles and other perks. Thurston has bought up non-media brands, including Gaia, a mapping app; FinisherPix, a photography service; Inntopia, a travel-booking software; and Trailforks, a trail database. (Last year, Thurston also reacquired MapMyFitness, his first company, from Under Armour.) He estimated that the worldwide audience interested in healthy, active life styles was at least a billion people, and argued that the industry was recession-proof. In the first, flush year of Outside, Inc., the company “was acting like a startup, and spending money like a startup,” a former executive told me. It occupied a new, spacious headquarters, on Pearl Street, Boulder’s main drag. Thurston liked to dream big—instead of, say, fifteen Outside, Inc., podcasts, why not a hundred? After years of operating on a shoestring budget, the abundance felt like a relief. The company implemented diversity goals, cleared years of freelancer debt, and committed to becoming carbon-neutral within five years. Amid an atmosphere of near-zero interest rates, venture-capital investors were drawn to grand plans and messianic visions, both of which Thurston was skilled at providing. If the company could convert ten per cent of the brand’s existing audiences into subscribers, he theorized, that would amount to twenty million members. (By comparison, the Times has nearly eleven million digital subscribers.) That goal was ambitious, Thurston conceded during his initial meeting with Outside staffers, but he did expect that, within four or five years, Outside, Inc., would be making three hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue from digital subscriptions alone. (That’s more than the Washington Post and The Atlantic made, combined, in 2024.) When I spoke to Thurston last month, he reminded me that the world was plagued by chronic disease, a loneliness epidemic, and generalized alienation. “I have a fundamental belief, Rachel, that the outdoors can solve many of these problems,” he told me. “I fundamentally feel like, if we can achieve that at scale, it can have a big impact on what’s happening in the world.” Thurston saw the media brands he acquired as the top of a content funnel, the “first touchpoint with the ecosystem,” as he put it. But, from early on, writing was an uneasy fit with the business plan. “You cannot get a return on a hundred and fifty million dollars from niche media,” Caley Fretz, the former editor of CyclingTips, which Outside, Inc., acquired in 2021, told me. “Once you’ve got Sequoia [Heritage] on board, the incentive is for just an insane level of scale, and the media entities were immediately superfluous. The audiences they had weren’t sizable enough, and the structures they operated under were not scalable. It became very obvious that the traditional journalism and editorial focus was going to have to give way.” According to Thurston, a significant amount of Outside, Inc.,’s daily engagement has been on the mapping apps. In 2022, the company went through two rounds of layoffs and ceased print publications of nearly all of its titles, apart from Outside. Outside had built its reputation on investigations and reported essays, and at first it continued to publish these kinds of stories, both in print and online. Sources said that long-form stories got good traffic, as did deeply reported service pieces, like detailed gear reviews. But in-depth reporting seemed to be less of a priority for Thurston, according to former editorial staffers. (When I asked Thurston if there were stories from the old days of Outside that would fit his vision for the magazine, the only example he could name was the piece that became “Into Thin Air.” “Any that come to mind other than Krakauer?” I asked. There was a long, awkward pause, and then Thurston said that he would think about it.) “I think the crux of the problem is he’s running a media business and he fundamentally doesn’t love media,” Felix Magowan, the founder of Pocket Outdoor Media, said. Last January, Outside published an extensive investigation, by Annette McGivney, into a prominent California climber’s long history of violence and sexual assault. (Later that year, the climber was sentenced to life in prison, for three sexual assaults in Yosemite National Park.) Shortly afterward, editorial staffers were called into a meeting with Heather Dietrick, Outside’s new chief media officer, who had formerly worked at Gawker and the Daily Beast. Dietrick cited the story about the climber, saying that although it was praiseworthy it was an example of the kind of content that Outside should consider moving away from. The company’s mission was to inspire people to go outside; dark and depressing investigative reporting did the exact opposite. (A representative wrote that the magazine aims for “a healthy mix of uplifting, adventure-focused stories and thorough investigative journalism.”) Then, last fall, after a writer on assignment was photographed standing with Tim Walz, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, while wearing a Harris/Walz cap, higher-ups pushed for extra layers of oversight for political content in advance of the election. This contributed to a “chilling” effect, former staffers said. Thurston said that there was never any kind of ban on political content, and pointed to Outside’s coverage of staff cuts in national parks as an example, among others. But former staffers told the Columbia Journalism Review that stories perceived as political were “defanged” or significantly delayed. Thurston seemed caught off guard by the negative reaction on social media to the most recent layoffs, which he characterized as part of a necessary shift in strategy. “To me, it’s kind of, like, adapt or die for every media company,” he told me. A representative from the public-relations team working with the company sent me an article from the Times titled “The Gen X Career Meltdown,” the subhead of which read, “Just when they should be at their peak, experienced workers in creative fields find that their skills are all but obsolete.” “I think you have a lot of passionate and somewhat earnest people,” Michael Roberts, an Outside staffer since 2000 and the company’s current director of strategic initiatives, said. “I do think the nostalgia element of this is a big factor.” These days, he argued, maybe the best way to stoke enthusiasm and capture fleeting attention spans isn’t only through a long article but through a live event, a podcast, or a video. “I think about my own kid—like, is he ever going to read a story like that?” But sources familiar with the company’s operations, including former executives, say that the problems at Outside, Inc., can’t just be chalked up to a changing media landscape. Former employees described Thurston as quick to both embrace and abandon ideas, strong on vision but weak on execution. (For the past three years, the company has not had a chief operating officer.) The new ownership migrated the magazine’s website to a new platform. “We lost all our Google cred, and our traffic just tanked,” a person familiar with operations told me. As the new ownership focussed on its digital strategy, print subscriptions declined by more than seventy per cent, the person familiar with Outside’s editorial mission said. “The people there are just trying to hold on to this thing with their fingernails. On a human-to-human level, it makes you sad, because these are people who care about the outdoors and people who care about publishing, and every resource they have is being systematically dismantled,” a current contributor told me. The membership model hasn’t taken off as planned. Outside+ presently has fewer than a million paid subscribers, and a significant number of these have come via the company’s acquisitions rather than through organic growth. “It’s all been organic shrinkage, actually,” the former executive said. “Where I thought we would be four years ago . . .” Thurston said. “The last four years have not been easy.” In 2022, Outside, Inc., announced the Outerverse, which included an N.F.T. marketplace “committed to promoting wellness, diversity, and sustainability with the help of blockchain technology.” Editors and writers were encouraged to produce stories about the blockchain. When a writer at CyclingTips wrote a lightly skeptical take on N.F.T.s, it was quickly taken down. That June, the company celebrated the launch of the Outerverse with a rooftop Jack Johnson concert in New York. But the project was plagued with technical issues, and only a few hundred of the ten thousand N.F.T.s were sold. That fall, FTX collapsed, and the N.F.T. market cratered. The Outerverse quietly shut down. “It was just the wrong moment,” Thurston said. “But it hasn’t stopped us from taking swings at opportunities.” Even before last month’s layoffs, the optimism of the early post-acquisition months had given way to a grim feeling that Outside, Inc., was struggling, and that the legacy of the acquired media brands hung in the balance. Owing in part to the company’s belt-tightening efforts, Thurston sold Outside’s Santa Fe offices. Before its new owners took possession—they are reportedly transforming the building into a boutique hotel—the old guard convened a hasty goodbye party. The atmosphere, at once debauched and sombre, felt like a wake, one attendee said. Partygoers were given permission to clear out most of the remaining furnishings, including framed prints of famous issues and National Magazine Award statuettes. Speaking with former Outside staffers, I got the sense that their anger was, at least to some extent, a cover for dismay at a more diffuse and painful set of losses, as tech and finance have encroached on the Mountain West: the ski resorts bought up by private equity; the dirtbag climbers priced out of small towns; Bozeman, of all places, becoming the next tech hot spot. “It just seemed like, to a lot of us watching from afar, Is this the way people are now? Is this the way they live their life?” Sides said. Right now, the company’s focus is on the Outside Festival, in Denver, later this spring. More than eighteen thousand tickets were sold for last year’s inaugural event, which was pitched as a cross between TED, South by Southwest, and the Consumer Electronics Show. This year’s events will include bands, a climbing wall, gear booths, and a startup-pitch competition. When Thurston spoke about it, his voice brightened. “It’s not just about the magazine,” he said, sounding suddenly full of enthusiasm for the future. “It’s, like, What are all of these different avenues to inspire people to get outdoors?” ♦

IBM workers told to come back to the office When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. IBM has reportedly enacted a mass return-to-office policy, mandating US sales staff to work at least three days a week at a client site, flagship office or sales hub. The news comes just days after the company told its US Cloud employees to return to “strategic” locations (company offices) on similar three-day-per-week terms. In the case of IBM’s US Cloud workers, they’ve been given until July 1 to adhere to the new policy. Workers needing to relocate have been cut a little more slack, with until October 1 to find a new home. It’s unclear when the company’s sales staff will need to move by. On the face of it, IBM’s return-to-office policy is on the nicer side for those in favor of remote and hybrid working. Three days has long been the average in a post-pandemic world, however many of IBM’s fellow tech giants, including Amazon, have enacted full-time five-day policies, marking an end to remote working altogether. Across the US, IBM has five flagship offices in New York, Raleigh, Washington DC and San Francisco. The fifth, in Austin, will be open by next year. A further eight sales hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle are also available for in-person work. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! According to an internal memo by Adam Lawrence seen by The Register, Dallas-based Digital Sales workers will be relocated to the new Austin office when it opens in 2026. Lawrence billed the RTO move as a “return to client initiative,” suggesting that sales staff need to be closer to clients to secure sales. Casually referred to as an initialism for ‘I’ve Been Moved’, IBM has a long history of relocating workers, however positions have been relatively stable at the company in the grand scheme of things. Apart from around 1,000 layoffs in August 2024 relating to the closure of a China R&D department, IBM’s only other big job cut was in January 2023, when 3,900 lost their jobs. Only a handful of much smaller reductions have followed since then.

Title: 2024 Top 100: Growing Pains Hamper The Estée Lauder Cos.

From an about-face on Amazon to a reset C-suite, the company was largely flat year-over-year. Senior Editor, Beauty With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Estée Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president Stéphane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won’t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Other changes included Tracey T. Travis stepping down as CFO, replaced by Akhil Shrivastava. The changes continued into 2025 under de La Faverie’s leadership, with Peter Jueptner, Estée Lauder group president, international, leaving, followed by a plethora of moves to its international leadership. Related Articles Fragrance EXCLUSIVE: Kering Beauté Names New CEO at Creed Skin Care EXCLUSIVE: Estée Lauder Focuses on Beauty Rest With Appointment of First Global Sleep Adviser, Dr. Matthew Walker On the brand level, Jane Hertzmark Hudis will take on the new title of executive vice president, chief brand officer, reporting directly to de La Faverie. The company’s 24 brands will now be organized by category clusters reporting to Hudis, with the hope being that this will break down silos and accelerate speed-to-market innovations. Much of the leadership reshuffling involves the elevation of internal executives, many of whom had joined the company in the last few years. Last June, Frédéric Malle announced plans to leave his eponymous niche fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. As for the board, Ronald S. Lauder, a son of founder Estée, retired and handed one of his seats to his son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer, who is married to Aerin Lauder. Most recently, the company expanded the number of layoffs it needs to make from the 3,000 announced in 2024 to as many as 7,000 as part of its Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. It was also reported that Lauder had hired consultancy Evercore to assess its current brand portfolio, with continued speculation that it could look at divestments. Throughout 2024, weak demand in China and Asia travel retail continued to weigh on Lauder, while cracks started to appear in its home market. As a result, the company pulled its full year 2025 outlook in October due to continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As of press time, it had not issued a new one. While analysts believe some impactive factors are out of Lauder’s control, de La Faverie is betting on his Beauty Reimagined strategy to “restore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years,” he said in a release. Key to his vision is expanding into high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to participate in key growth opportunities in prestige beauty. Over the last nine months, for example, key brands like Estée Lauder, Clinique and The Ordinary have launched on Amazon, while in Europe, the company is eager to leverage the strength of its skin care category in the pharmacy channel, for one. Per the company, the move to Amazon appears to have been so far successful. As for launches, Balmain debuted Les Éternels de Balmain, a collection of eight fragrances, produced under license by the Estée Lauder Cos. Deciem, the incubator and parent company of The Ordinary — which closed its $1.7 billion deal with parent The Estée Lauder Cos. in 2024 — debuted Loopha, a body care brand with two products, hand and body washes. Other key launches included La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty’s Runway Lip Color, with the help of its first ever celebrity face, Angelina Jolie. Also during 2024, Clinique made a philanthropic commitment of $5 million over seven years to establish the Mount Sinai-Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Centre with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. It will study skin aging, skin allergies and inflammatory eczematous skin conditions. Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Title: The 2024 Top 100 Beauty Companies
URL: http://wwd.com/lists/top-beauty-companies-in-the-world-2024-1237087322/

WWD Beauty Inc's annual ranking of the world's largest beauty companies by sales. Speed and agility were the buzzwords of 2024, so it’s apropos that beauty sales broke the $250 billion barrier for the first time last year. But there are clouds on the horizon. What’s clear from the 2024 WWD Beauty Inc Top 100, our annual ranking of the world’s largest beauty companies by sales, is that the industry is undergoing seismic shifts as a result of geopolitical tensions, technological advances and a consumer landscape that is more complex than ever before. The good news is that total sales hit $252.09 billion. But that represented an increase of just 2.8 percent year-over-year, almost half that of 2023’s 5.3 percent gain. The ongoing slowdown in China weighed heavily on sales, and corporate restructuring was in the cards for a number of players as they sought to derisk and home in on high-potential categories. L’Oréal accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales, its share of the Top 100 inching up once more, by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, up from 14.7 percent in 2019. The top 10 companies overall generated sales of $147.49 billion, or 58.5 percent of total Top 100 revenues, down 0.9 percentage points. Despite the year’s challenges, the vast majority — 73 percent — of companies saw their sales increase, but only 29 saw double-digit gains, down from 37 a year earlier, a sign of slower growth on the market overall. Of the 17 players with negative sales progression, seven were down more than 10 percent and three posted declines of more than 20 percent. Among the biggest winners: Spain’s Puig entered the top 10 for the first time, up four places on a year ago, driven by strong growth in fragrance and skin care. L’Occitane, buoyed by the year’s viral hit Sol de Janeiro, climbed two places to number 18. While times were tough for a number of C-beauty players, the biggest Chinese company on the list, Proya, jumped eight spots to number 28, the first C-beauty firm to reach the Top 30 global beauty companies. With social-savvy affordable makeup players still trending as consumers feel the pinch, despite weakness in mass overall, especially in the U.S., beauty got two new billionaire brands, with E.l.f Beauty and Cosnova both surpassing that milestone in dollar terms. This year’s newcomers include D&G Beauty, which has seen its sales explode since it took its beauty license, previously held by Shiseido, back in-house; Chinese makeup artist brand Mao Geping, which went public in Hong Kong; Auréa Group, the new owner seeking to turn around The Body Shop; Shein, which is flying high with in-house brand Sheglam, and AS Beauty, which bought Bliss World from L Catterton and has successfully rejuvenated the Laura Geller makeup brand. But it was a rough ride for beauty on the stock market in 2024. Of the 49 listed players tracked in our By the Numbers section, only 15 saw their share prices increase through the year, with Victoria’s Secret & Co. the biggest gainer as the market reacted to its turnaround efforts. Of the 29 public players whose share value fell, 21 were down in the double digits, and five of the biggest decliners — Nu Skin Enterprises, Yunnan Botanee, Olaplex, The Estée Lauder Cos. and Shiseido — were already on the wane a year ago, with their market value falling further in 2024. The WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranks the world’s largest beauty manufacturers. Firms are arranged by their beauty sales for the 2024 calendar year. For those companies whose fiscal year did not run from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, estimates were calculated. All sales figures were either obtained from the companies or generated with the help of industry sources, indicated by (EST.) in the ranking. For this list, “beauty” includes fragrance, makeup, skin care, body care, sun care, hair care, deodorant, plus cellulite and shaving products. It does not include bar soaps, razors, toothpastes, food and diet foods, medicines, vitamins, detergents or appliances. The revenues only include sales of beauty products each firm owns or manufactures and do not include business from private-label lines produced for other brands or products distributed for other companies. Information in the main brands section reflects company holdings in 2024. Year-over-year percentage changes are in reported terms, not on a like-for- like or constant-currency basis, unless specified. Non-U.S.-based firms’ sales are converted into dollars according to the 2024 average yearly exchange rate.* Sales figures in non-U.S. currencies were converted to the dollar using the following 2024 average exchange rates from Oanda.com: €1=$1.08190 ¥1=$0.00660898£1=$1.277951 KRW=$0.000733035 R$1=$0.186202CNY 1=$0.1390721 Rupee=$0.0119508 SFr=$1.136091 HK$=$0.1281551 Mexican peso=$0.0548935 Clichy, France2024 Beauty Sales:$47.04 Billion€43.48 Billion+5.6% VS. 2023 Despite continuing to outperform the market as a whole, beauty’s biggest player was not immune to the market’s challenges in 2024. The company described the year as “a tale of two halves,” with a strong first six months followed by weakness in the latter part of the year due to the global slowdown and ongoing challenges in China. Had it not been for the North Asia region, its sales would have advanced in the high single digits, it said. London2024 Beauty Sales:$26.63 Billion (EST.)€24.61 Billion (EST.)+1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) The upheaval at Unilever continues. 2024 was a year dedicated to slimming down and streamlining its operating structure under CEO Hein Schumacher, who joined the company in July 2023 and implemented a major reset in October that year.

Title: FDA Approves Neuralink Rival’s Brain Implant
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/17/fda-approves-neuralink-rivals-brain-implant/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T17:34:17Z

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: You Know Who Else Really Hates Trump’s Tariffs? Hollywood

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Business The Incredible Shrinking Studio Chief Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Title: Your Skills Could Be Worth Up To $5,000/Month—How To Cash In

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Many are sitting on a goldmine of skills and will retire, not realizing what they could have ... More achieved in their lifetime You’ve likely helped a college friend rewrite their resume, explained a process clearly to a co-worker, or simplified a tech tool when a family member just wasn’t getting it. You never charged for these services. But while you’re not charging…someone else is. Most people sit on skills that could easily be turned into an asset that makes them anywhere from $500, to $5,000, or even five figures a month. But, like you, they overlook them and write these skills off as normal, nothing special. Unfortunately, when finances are tight, the cost of living is up, layoffs are looming, and inflation creeps into everyday items like eggs or major purchases like buying a house--they’re stuck with no options when they had plenty of options, they could have utilized all along. Are you sitting on a goldmine of skills that could be the key to unlocking financial freedom and career satisfaction? Let’s find out. To begin with, we’ll conduct a self-audit. Answering these questions helps uncover potential hidden skills--skills which you’ve had for a long while and are inherent to your nature, but which you haven't capitalized on because you don't think they're that significant. If you’re still struggling to identify yours, here are some examples that will spark your creative brainstorming, including what income sources they could lead to: Now that you’re ready to position yourself for success and take the leap in bringing your skills to the world, they’re no longer hidden; they’re going to be the number one thing you’re known for and associated with. To do this, you must ask yourself, Who needs a service that predominantly utilizes this skill? You can even ask ChatGPT to help you come up with ideas so you can brainstorm several side hustle ideas or business ideas using the skills that you have. This will give you an idea of what services you can bring to the market. Now conduct some research and pick a niche. Make it precise and highly specific. If you’re too general with your offer, you’ll appeal to no one at all. After doing this, clearly define your offer and what the expected positive outcome would be. Once you’ve laid this foundation, it’s time to build visibility and credibility online. You achieve this through creating digital assets such as: Acquiring testimonials from people you’ve worked with before, or delivering the service for free in return for reviews, to no more than five people Finally, price your skill according to value, not based on time or hours worked. Pricing by the hour limits your earning potential and leads to you inadvertently under-pricing your worth. Now, here’s the exciting part: where do you go to sell your skill and the service connected with it? Here are some examples (bear in mind that not all will be relevant depending on your business and industry vertical, but you can combine several of these together to get results): You can even create an entire online persona revolving around your once hidden skill, and end up becoming the face of it. Your skills are your best kept secret Your skills are your best kept secret. It’s time for the world to know who you really are. Stop sitting on your gifts. Instead of saying, “It’s nothing special,” begin treating all of your skills like assets.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google also removed underrepresented language from its grant website and scrubbed mention of diversity and equity from its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post that it would remain committed to DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Salesforce is getting rid of its diversity hiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Uber eliminated an incentive tied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value. It removed the entire diversity and inclusion section from its latest 10-K filing and made no use of the word diversity at all, according to the SF Examiner. UnitedHealth Group removed mention of DEI from much of its website. For example, several pages once dedicated to DEI no longer load, and the company also removed a 2022 blog post with a vice president about DEI. Yahoo removed several pages and sections that relate to or mention diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Title: Inside WPP’s $150 million InfoSum purchase

Editor’s Note: This piece was updated and then re-edited to reflect GroupM’s characterization of WPP’s relationship to the market. WPP’s acquisition of data clean room InfoSum has raised eyebrows both inside and outside the industry, not just because of what it signals about the holding company’s ambitions but also because of what it reveals about its anxieties. Let’s start with the upside. The holdco has bought a business it believes, rightly or wrongly, can bolster its cash cow: GroupM. The media buying unit has faced those pressures for some time, and those cracks have played a role in several high-profile client departures over the past year. Yes, WPP has chalked up some headline wins recently — Amazon and Unilever, to name a couple — but there’s no denying that whatever GroupM is selling, CMOs aren’t buying it like they used to. The pitch is simple enough. InfoSum’s clean room uses federated learning to let marketers work with sensitive data without actually moving or exposing it. In theory, this enables rich insights by combining first-party data with a vast pool of privacy-safe signals — hundreds of billions of them — sourced from the likes of Netflix, Samsung Ads, and Channel 4, along with data partners like Experian and TransUnion. It’s the kind of offering that could further GroupM’s ongoing efforts to stitch together insights across fragmented platforms. But for all the strategic logic, the road ahead is murky. For all InfoSum’s promise, the clean room category itself is in transition. Once heralded as the cornerstone of privacy-first advertising, clean rooms lost some of their shine once marketers realized they solved only part of the puzzle. On their own, they don’t deliver the scale, simplicity, or seamless outcomes CMOs expect, especially in a landscape preferring retail media channels where data activation and measurement come bundled. In addition to the high costs, technical complexity, and limited interoperability, it’s easy to see why clean rooms have struggled to scale as point solutions. More and more, they’re being folded into larger tech stacks or absorbed into cloud infrastructure — seen as less of a strategy and more of a supporting feature. WPP may view InfoSum as a strategic linchpin for GroupM and Choreograph, but the bigger question is whether it can transform a specialized tool into something that moves the whole machine. And then there’s the trust problem. InfoSum’s appeal was built over nearly a decade on neutrality — a Switzerland for sensitive data. That’s a much harder pitch now. No matter how WPP frames it, it’s tough to imagine rival holding companies lining up to upload customer data into a platform now owned by one of their fiercest competitors. The promise of independence, once central to InfoSum’s volume, is up for debate the moment its ownership changes hands. Little wonder, then, that the deal has left some WPP clients, partners and even rivals scratching their heads over its swoop for InfoSum. One GroupM client told Digiday they had reservations over how the deal would really add value to the agency network. “Even before the deal, we were already considering whether to put the account up for review at some point this year or next,” the marketer said. Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun highlighted the challenges of integrating a clean room like InfoSum into a wider proposition during the company’s earnings call earlier this week, underscoring how closely the industry is watching not just what WPP bought but what it will now do with it. “A clean room alone is an empty shell,” said Sadoun. “If you don’t add proprietary data that will bring to your client something that they don’t have then they won’t find a new source of goals. They won’t be able to connect every individual to the entire media ecosystem.” In the weeks leading up to the purchase, InfoSum pursued a $25 million Series C investment — it raised $93 million across its prior funding rounds. InfoSum CEO Lauren Wetzel told Digiday WPP was eager to participate in the round, but it soon evolved into a wholesale takeover. “About a week out from closing the Series C, one of those investors who was new to the cap table along with WPP shifted gears and felt very strongly there was more of an opportunity for a [sale] transaction,” she added. WPP did not disclose the sum it paid for its new acquisition in its April 3 announcement, prompting speculation over InfoSum’s final exit figure. This was further fueled when Chrysalis — the lead participant of InfoSum’s 2021 raise, when it was valued at $300 million — announced a $63 million liquidation of its stake in the U.K.-headquartered company on the same day. Estimated exit prices vary, although separate sources (both of whom were investors in InfoSum) told Digiday the eventual sale price was approximately $150 million. WPP declined Digiday’s requests to comment on these claims. While Wetzel didn’t comment on the financials of the sale, she spoke on the decision to switch from raising a Series C to signing off on an acquisition. “It was compelling for our investors,” she said, “and it had to be for me to change my mind.” Additionally, sources claimed InfoSum made dozens of layoffs in the weeks leading up to the purchase — Digiday understands this number is lower than 20 — a period when Companies House initiated compulsory strike-off proceedings. According to Wetzel, who is now also GroupM’s chief solutions officer, the March 4 notice, which marked the beginning of a process that could have resulted in InfoSum’s compulsory dissolution, was the result of its fundraising efforts. According to Wetzel, the timing of its efforts to raise a Series C round meant InfoSum deferred filing its accounts with the registry of all U.K. businesses. Thus, Companies House triggered the process, which Wetzel characterized as “pretty standard” given the context. Furthermore, in the weeks since the purchase was confirmed, industry observers raised how Brian Lesser, CEO of WPP’s GroupM, was chief executive of InfoSum as recently as July of last year and whether this amounted to a conflict of interest. Digiday was told that Lesser was not part of the acquisition process for this reason. Instead, a team of technical execs oversaw the transaction and is held to the same degree of third-party oversight as any other, according to WPP. The agency network, once the undisputed heavyweight of media buying, has spent the last few years walking a tightrope: trying to modernize its infrastructure without unraveling the scale that made it powerful in the first place. The result has been a kind of strategy stutter. Internally, leadership changes have only deepened the disorientation. Over the past 18 months, the exits of GroupM’s CEO in North America, Kirk McDonald, followed by GroupM CEO Christian Juhl being replaced by Lesser a year later, have left staff unsure of who’s steering the ship and in which direction. Lesser, in particular, made waves upon his return, declaring to Adweek that within five years, “there is no human that touches a media plan.” It was meant to signal ambition, especially when paired with the familiar refrain that AI won’t take jobs, but people who use it will. For some inside GroupM, though, it landed less like a rallying cry, more like a warning — an aspirational soundbite that glossed over the day-to-day friction of a network still figuring out how to move forward. “It seemed like there was very little regard for the people who are actually running the agency, ” said the partner, echoing what they described as widespread frustration among colleagues and friends still inside the network in reaction to the quote. Outside the network, things aren’t much better. On the new business, the media group trails its rivals. Last year it ranked third behind Omnicom Media Group and Publicis in net new and retained client wins with a total value of $3.5 billion, according to COMvergence, a global research firm that tracks agency pitches. When accounting for that value without losses, it climbed to second place with $8.7 billion, still behind Omnicom. “Clients are really souring on WPP — they’re not interested in the new direction it’s on,” said a pitch consultant on condition of anonymity. “WPP has been dormant while its biggest rivals have been proactive. That’s had an impact on GroupM, which doesn’t seem to have an exciting story to tell clients in the way that Publicis Media does.” Lesser has defended the network’s performance, arguing it’s paying for sins of the past. He also noted that GroupM has actually beaten out Publicis more recently. “I think the notion that WPP is not competitive is a little bit overplayed and dramatic,” he told Digiday last week when the InfoSum deal was announced. He added, “If you look at some of our wins from late last year, whether that be Amazon, or Unilever — taking the commerce business back off Publicis, because Unilever was unhappy there — and winning J & J in a direct head-to-head with Publicis. I think that we are very competitive in the market. And frankly, when you look at our financial results, that has more to do with things that we’ve lost in the past, that we’re just feeling the after-effects of.” The irony is that for all the talk of reinvention, GroupM’s future seems increasingly straddled with the same issues as its past: a clunky operating model, an over-reliance on scale, and an uneasy relationship with the very technology it’s banking on to save it.

Title: Want to Save Democracy? Organize a Union in Your Workplace.

Activate your online access Authoritarian regimes make crushing unions a top priority for a reason: Strong, independent unions are the best safeguard against tyranny. Dozens of Starbucks employees and union supporters protested alleged anti-union tactics by the company outside a Kansas City Starbucks on March 3, 2022. It’s easy to feel powerless. The US government is enabling Israel’s genocide in Palestine and deporting immigrants to concentration camps in El Salvador. Elon Musk is gutting public services. And corporations, emboldened by the new regime, are urging it to go even further and roll back workers’ rights and public accountability. These forces can feel “too big to fail,” which raises the question: How can we meaningfully fight these powerful actors? If you want to fight the rise of fascism, organize a union in your workplace—or get a job and help your coworkers organize. There’s a reason that authoritarian regimes often make crushing unions their top priority: Free and independent unions are the best safeguard of democracy. Unionizing provides workers with the means of building power outside of capital and the state. A strong labor movement could launch a general strike in protest of a repressive regime that would shut down the economy and force concessions—or at least galvanize resistance and turn popular opinion against the state, as the 1943 strike at the Fiat factory in Mirafiori, Italy, which helped bring down Benito Mussolini’s dictatorship, demonstrated. The threat of a general strike has not lost its power: In 2019, during the first Trump administration, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, helped end a government shutdown by calling for one. After flights were grounded in New York City, politicians reached a deal to reopen the government within hours. Unionizing also allows workers to leverage their power to resist state and corporate demands, while protecting workers from retaliation when they speak out against injustice—both within and outside the workplace. In a heroic example of unionized workers refusing work to protect human rights, workers at a Scottish Rolls Royce plant in 1973 refused to repair engines used by the Chilean dictatorship. Their union had already issued statements condemning the junta and its torture and murder of their fellow trade unionists; this was a means of putting their beliefs into action and helping to save lives. As the US government persecutes marginalized groups and as corporations respond by dropping their pretext of caring about social justice and ending their diversity, inclusion, and equity programs, US unions must likewise become or remain a means of collective advocacy. Rank-and-file organizing within Starbucks Workers United, the union campaign I helped launch in 2021, has meant that the union has spoken out on a range of issues—from LGBTQ rights to racial justice to solidarity with Palestine. Through actions like “Strike with Pride”—a national strike over the company’s cuts to coverage of gender-affirming care, retaliation against queer organizers, and removal of pride decorations from cafes—the Starbucks union is mobilizing within the labor movement to make these demands over human rights mainstream. Even where workers do not already have left-wing sympathies, a strong and independent labor movement can change its members’ beliefs and make authoritarianism less appealing. Right-wing populism recognizes that workers are angry, but instead of channeling that anger upward, toward the corporate bosses and their collaborators, its survival relies on directing resentment downward, toward immigrants, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized groups. Union-busting often follows this same template, as corporations try to prevent workers from building solidarity with each other and instead stoke divisions within the workforce. Union organizing unites people around class, helping to build genuine community and solidarity between groups the ruling class seeks to pit against each other. Through shared struggle, workers who might otherwise have been attracted to right-wing populism often develop a deeper understanding of the ways their own interest is entwined with their coworkers’—including the coworkers who belong to groups that might be painted as “the enemy.” A 2019 study indicated that even where white working-class voters had “psychological tendencies” toward authoritarianism, involvement in unions frequently “inoculated” them against voting for Trump. But the impact of unionization on members’ outlook goes far beyond the ballot box: Authoritarian regimes rely on the public looking the other way from injustice (or cheering it on), while the labor movement emphasizes that an injury to one is an injury to all and urges collective action to confront abuse. If unions are our best hope to reverse course, what should the labor movement prepare for as authoritarians take power in the United States? The playbook for undermining or outlawing independent unions has several components, including attempting to co-opt unions, restricting or eliminating existing unions, and creating loyal or company unions to create a semblance of worker voice without giving workers real power. Co-opting existing unions is one of the most straightforward strategies, targeting existing fault lines within the labor movement, but its scale is limited since it relies largely on the consent of the co-opted. In India, for example, unions are typically linked to political parties; thus, the RSS, a far-right nationalist paramilitary organization, has both a political wing—Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—and a labor wing. In other countries, unions that were initially independent have since aligned with right-wing political groups: Poland’s Solidarność evolved from an independent union formed during an illegal wildcat strike against authoritarian state socialism into a supporter of the reactionary Law and Justice party. Right-wing tendencies have always existed within the US labor movement. Most early unions, even tho se that organized Black and white workers into interracial locals, supported the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. As government repression targeted leftist and anti-war unions in the beginning of the 20th century, many unions adopted increasingly conservative platforms, culminating in purges of Communist organizers from the labor movement at the height of the red scare. The Teamsters endorsed Nixon in 1972 and Reagan in 1980. Is their president’s current coziness with Trump—Sean O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention last year; while the union declined to endorse a candidate, it released polling data indicating that members largely supported Trump—a true departure from their past? Not necessarily, but it is a concerning sign—especially when workers at companies ranging from Chipotle to Amazon are seeking to join the Teamsters as part of a commitment to joining the labor movement and building a better world. O’Brien’s right-wing turn also included tweeting his approval of Senator Josh Hawley’s anti-DEI and anti-trans op-ed, “The Promise of Pro-Labor Conservatism.” Unions must resist the temptation to accept a “pro-labor conservatism” rooted in macho, white-supremacist nationalism. The United Auto Workers has recently pivoted from declaring “Trump is a scab” during the election season to writing “We’re ready to work with Trump” in the pages of The Washington Post. Even if the UAW thinks its members will benefit from Trump’s erratic tariffs—which has put the UAW at odds with the Canadian autoworkers’ union and has already resulted in layoffs of UAW members at some domestic auto plants—making a bargain with this administration is a fundamentally unwise decision. Any wins gained through such compromises would come at the cost of the UAW’s moral compass and labor movement solidarity: the very things that make a union a powerful force for justice. Where authoritarians are unable to co-opt unions, they frequently restrict their ability to operate, criminalizing many actions, targeting union leaders, and changing labor law to make organizing much harder. In Turkey, for example, Erdoğan’s regime has made an already-challenging climate for organizing even more repressive. The state has suppressed strikes, arrested union leaders, and used the state of emergency it declared in 2016 after a failed coup attempt to fire about 130,000 public-sector workers, claiming they were disloyal to the government. Saree Makdisi Elie Mystal Emma Jackson Jeet Heer Sound familiar? Trump’s recent attacks on federal workers’ unions—including his executive order stripping most federal workers of their right to organize—follow the same playbook. This attempt to ban unions within a wide range of government agencies on “national security” pretexts doesn’t even try to hide its retaliatory intent of preventing “hostile unions” (as the administration’s lawsuit refers to many federal unions) from acting as a countervailing force through collective bargaining. The Trump administration has further targeted union organizers and members across sectors based on their immigration status, including sheet-metal worker Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a member of SMART, who was abducted and taken to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison due to a so-called “administrative error” that the Trump administration has refused to reverse, in defiance of judicial orders. ICE is also known to have kidnapped a United Farm Workers leader, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez; revoked the work authorizations of 200 unionized manufacturing workers in Kentucky who are members of the IUE-CWA; abducted unionized graduate students, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil; seized SEIU member Lewelyn Dixon, a University of Washington lab tech; and raided a roofing company where workers had protested safety conditions, disappearing 37 workers whose families do not know their whereabouts. Finally, the Trump administration has signaled its intention to repeal Section 8(a)2 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which bans company unions—organizations that are dominated or controlled by the boss, often with the intention of preventing free and independent unions from gaining traction instead. In between assertions about the “Judeo-Christian tradition, stretching back to Genesis, recogniz[ing] fruitful work as integral to human dignity [and] as service to God” and policy proposals to ban critical race theory trainings, encourage “Sabbath rest,” and reduce overtime pay thresholds, the labor section of Project 2025 lays out a plan to facilitate the creation of works councils and other forms of what it calls “non-union worker voice and representation.” Before the passage of the NLRA in 1935, many businesses created company unions. After using the National Guard to massacre striking coal miners in an encampment in Ludlow, Colorado, in 1914 (burning 11 children alive), John D. Rockefeller Jr., embarked on an effort to restore his reputation through a public relations campaign that included an “employee representation plan” under his control. Company unions ran rampant in industries ranging from steel to textiles to railways to photography. The NLRA’s prohibition was designed to put an end to this practice to help remove barriers to workers organizing freely. Today, advocates of “associational” or “alternative” unionization, like labor scholar Tom Kochan (who remains a staunch supporter of collective bargaining, as well), argue that because union density is so low, “labor law needs to open up to support a range of voice options.” For very different reasons, some of the Project 2025 authors, including Oren Cass, share this view: Cass has maintained that the Republican Party should be more open to unions (within a narrower definition of what “protected concerted activity” entails) and has advocated for workers’ councils and placing workers on corporate boards. While these alternatives may give workers more voice—i.e., a forum to express opinions—they don’t provide workers real power—the ability to bargain about issues and build an independent organization. Moreover, rather than helping open the door to forming a real union, they often make it more difficult to organize. If workers are likely to face an intense union-busting campaign and retaliation for forming an independent union, but the company is encouraging participation in an alternative model, many workers would settle for the safer but powerless option. Even during the best of times, organizing a union is not easy; labor law in the United States is extremely weak, and, as labor professor John Logan writes, corporations “are prepared to do whatever is necessary, lawful or unlawful, to crush their organizing campaigns.” But in our current moment, it is critical that workers continue to organize in order to build power independent from corporations and the state, and to insist on their unions maintaining principled positions rather than negotiating with authoritarians. Growing democracy in the workplace is our best line of defense for democracy outside of it, too. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: Inside Muse, Microsoft's gen-AI game tool everyone hates - what's really going on and why is it being marketed at Xbox fans?

If Muse isn't creating games, then what is it creating - and how should we respond? Earlier this month, Microsoft set loose upon the world a new, publicly-available demo of its video game-focused generative AI model, Muse. As far as demos go, it was a significant one: a playable, browser-based "AI rendition" of legendary first-person shooter Quake 2. But rather than landing as, say, an impressive demonstration of Microsoft's bounding progress in artificial intelligence, the Quake 2 "Copilot gaming experience" was widely slammed by the gaming public as, amongst many other things, "shit". The criticism has been more or less universal, ranging from members of the public describing it as "absolutely fucking disgusting" and "like horrible Nyquil-induced sleep paralysis", to a Forbes "review" of the game that called it "an abomination". Members of the games press condemned reporting in The Verge, which ran the headline "Microsoft has created an AI-generated version of Quake", as overly credulous, labelling any similar coverage as "unpaid PR work". Will Smith, a tech blogger, offered a more measured response but still concluded that it is ultimately "a gimmick. It's interactive video, and yeah, I guess that's impressive, but it doesn't capture the magic of interlocking systems that still makes playing Quake 2 fun in 2025, despite the fact that it's almost 30 years old and dates to the earliest days of 3D graphics." All of this comes just a couple of weeks after Microsoft's initial reveal of Muse itself, which that time featured non-interactive but similarly murky footage based on Ninja Theory's Bleeding Edge - and which received a similarly heated response. That first unveiling also came with further issues of its own. Reactions zeroed in on the notion of Muse being used for "gameplay ideation" in particular, as well as Xbox chief Phil Spencer's seemingly outlandish claim, in an accompanying video, that Muse could "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future," making older games compatible with "any device". It was a messy reveal. At the time, we clarified - with the help of AI expert Dr Michael Cook - that Muse very much was not "creating games". As Cook laid out in his blog, the research paper Microsoft had published in Nature alongside the reveal of this model "is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," but is instead, "about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools." But that didn't mean there weren't plenty of limitations and concerns. On Spencer's comments on preservation, for instance, Cook noted: "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of Final Fantasy 8 looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort." All in all, it leads to what is on the surface an utterly bizarre situation. Microsoft, one of the world's wealthiest businesses, is committing presumably vast sums of money towards the work of its Muse AI research team. The research team features a number of experts, such as Dr Sam Devlin and research lead Dr Katja Hofmann, that are well-known and widely cited in their field. And the early results of this research are something that almost everyone in the industry seems to totally despise. There is intense scepticism towards what Muse AI does, what it could do, and whether it could ever be useful for anything. But what is actually going on? Can the research team behind it offer more credible answers? And how, exactly, ought we react to all of it? To help understand, I spoke to two of the people who have been at the heart of the conversation around Muse since its reveal: Drs Mike Cook and Katja Hofmann. Cook is a senior lecturer in computer science at King's College London and specialises in artificial intelligence, specifically computational creativity, automated game design, and design and analysis of generative software. We've covered his work on Eurogamer a few times over the years, including an AI program he built, ANGELINA, which was capable of creating video games of its own back in 2013, and his quest to see if it could win a game jam the following year. He talks with the soft directness of a fast-moving lecturer who doesn't mind if you really can't keep up with the source material, as long as you're at least willing to keep trying. Speaking to me after the first Muse reveal, but before the second featuring Quake 2, I asked Cook to explain what was going on in the Bleeding Edge examples we were first given. "I suppose you could think of it as: if you showed ChatGPT a screenshot of a video game, and then you said, "Could you show me a video of what would happen if there was an enemy here", and it generates a video showing you the player playing from that screenshot, but with an enemy on the screen," he says. That's a "very clumsy" summary, he adds, "but basically that's what they're trying to do." A key point to emphasise here is, as Cook says, that "it's generating images. It's not generating code or anything like that." It's a series of images forming a video, and that video is what's known as being "conditioned", in AI research terms. "It's conditioned on inputs," Cook explains, in the same way that an image generation tool such as Midjourney "is image generation conditioned by text." If you tell an AI image generator you want an image of a cat, for instance, "it generates an image and then it looks at the text and it's like, this can't be any image; it has to be an image of a cat." With Muse, that conditioning is "on not just the video of people playing the game, but actually the buttons they were pressing." This means that when we talk about the 'playable' models, such as this latest version of Muse, and Google's similarly controversial Genie, "it is doing video generation, but you can also say "Generate the next frame of the video if the jump button was being pressed," and it will take that into account when it generates the next frame." The key point here is that this all remains fundamentally predictive, in the same way that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are ultimately predicting sequences of words based on your text prompts. I put the same explain-this-to-me-like-the-layperson-I-am question to Hofmann, who is senior principal researcher and the lead of Microsoft's game intelligence research team. Softly spoken, with a slight German accent, Hofmann is a precise talker, measuring words in her combination of seasoned public spokesperson familiar with the conference trail, and excitable research grad who still believes in the work. "In simple terms," she says, the first model "shows we can train an AI simulation of an existing video game. So that means if we train a model on the game visuals and the control actions, we learn a model that is then able to simulate this." So, she continues, "you create a small, playable scene, that's only backed then at inference time by the model," inference time being the duration it takes for the model to process new, unseen data and make predictions on it. In the "real time" version of this model, then, this actually "allows players to connect the controller and play within the imagination - or play within the model." In even more simple terms, think of it like this: Muse is a model that generates simulated video footage of the video game it's been trained on, and simulates interactivity with that footage by predicting what your button presses would cause that video footage to do, and then replicating those. So if, for example, all of the Bleeding Edge footage used as training data shows that when players push the right analogue stick upwards in Bleeding Edge, the camera looks upwards, then when "playing the model", pushing the analogue stick upwards likewise causes the simulated video feed to tilt upwards towards the sky. All this notion of "playing" Muse raises one particularly important question: is Muse generating video games? The emphatic answer from both Hofmann and Cook is, essentially: no. For Cook, there's a question about whether it's even accurate to describe Muse, and similar models such as Genie or Oasis, as "playable" at all. "On YouTube you can watch panoramic video and turn your head around, but that's not "playable" video. That's just a video that has some interaction with it." At the same time, he says, "if you think about those streaming services where you were playing at home and your keyboard inputs were being sent to a server," such as say, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna or the doomed Google Stadia, "your computer was just showing you video. And the video was kind of conditioned on keyboard inputs." It's best to think of it instead as "video of a 3D world, but the 3D world doesn't really exist." Whether that does or doesn't disqualify it from actually being a game is up for debate. As Cook himself says, "it gets a bit philosophical at some point." (An example of a natural follow-on question that's either fascinating or incredibly boring to you, depending on your persuasion: does a video game world defined by fixed code "exist"? Does it exist on your hardware more than a streamed one from a server? Or, as in Muse's case, a very murky, inconsistent one conjured on the spot from no code at all?) During our initial conversation, Hofmann extended an invitation to visit the Microsoft AI research team's offices in Cambridge in order to try out a demo of Muse in person. There, she elaborated further on this notion of playing the model, rather than its attempt at recreating a game. "We're trying not to refer to it as a game, because it is not a game," Hofmann tells me during the in-person demo, which this time takes place after the reveal of the Quake 2 simulation. "We're thinking of "playing the model", so that exploratory kind of interaction of figuring out: What are the limitations? Where does it break? What doesn't work, what works?" To Hofmann, it's a process she feels is "fascinating," albeit joking that said fascination might be reserved for a very specific subset of researchers who share her enthusiasm. In fact to Hofmann, testing the boundaries of where the model breaks is in many ways part of the point of publishing the Quake 2 demo, and indeed creating it in the first place. She compares it to other, non-interactive generative AI favourably in that sense, in that with attempting to replicate video games you can simply find the flaws much faster. "If you interact with a chatbot, you never get that immediate experience of: I can essentially see where data is missing, or where it's making mistakes. Here, because we're so wired for 3D interaction and visual interaction, we get that immediate experience of: you can literally debug the model by going in and playing within this environment," she says. "And to me, that is the key fascinating aspect of what we're able to show here." Having "played the model" myself both via the online, browser-based Quake 2 Copilot demo and again in person, via an Xbox controller connected to Hofmann's laptop, this notion does have an element of truth to it. I played an updated version of the Bleeding Edge-based simulation alongside the Quake 2 one - both based on WHAMM (note the second M), which is the more recent version that makes the Quake 2 demo possible - and also tested out the drag-and-drop functionality of adding interactable items, jump pads, and enemies in real time. It's worth making very clear up front that both of them are, as video games, utterly terrible, for all the many reasons already detailed at length and with far more satisfying bite elsewhere than I could ever conjure: they're fuzzy, laggy, nightmarish non-places, chugging along at nine frames per second, crucially without much in the way of consistent internal logic, let alone meaning or intent. They are, by every measure of playability, unplayable. However, treated as a kind of meta-game, where the challenge isn't within the game but in just attempting to successfully play it at all, there is something at least novel and interesting here. In one moment of quasi-Quake 2, for instance, I found myself stuck in a dark, underwater secret area with no apparent way out, not helped by the vagueness and inconsistency of the visuals and controls. Then I realised I could "play the model" to escape, effectively gaming its 0.9 second memory by looking at a dark wall for a moment, then turning back around to discover the world had totally changed and a route was now clear. These are, in their own ways, the kinds of consistent rules we need to make something a game, learned in the same way we learn any other mechanic or moment of internal game logic: if I do X, Y happens. That, technically, is a video game. And arguably an interesting one, if only given its novelty and context, much the same way as an out-there art gallery installation can be when you're only interacting with it once or twice. But also still not a particularly good one. That also ties into the natural follow-on question here, which asks what the actual point of this model is, and what its uses might or might not eventually be. If the question of whether or not Muse's synthetic creations are video games seems a tad murky, this next one's about as clear as mud. Who, or what, is Muse actually for? Again, this question rapidly takes on a philosophical form as soon as you begin to prod at it, but before we get to the real chin-stroking it makes sense to run through the proposed uses that've already been suggested so far. One of the prominent, and most easy to dismiss, is this notion of preservation touted by Phil Spencer. Hofmann, it's worth noting, was on that slightly odd, video call-style reveal video with Spencer when he raised this as a possibility. I asked her whether she felt that was a genuinely feasible use for Muse, now or at any point in the future. "What I see at this point in time is that we're having so many conversations on what could be the potential branch-out points into real applications," she said, "and game preservation has been one of them that multiple people have brought up. And one that Phil, for example, was particularly excited about." However, she continued, "I see this as one of the capabilities of not something that is, in any full form, feasible today. I like to ground it in: what's feasible today is I can create a simulation of a level in a game, that gives you a sense of playing a version of that game, that is not exactly like the real game." "My sense is that over the next decade, this technology will mature," she added, noting that she felt it "perfectly feasible" to believe it could eventually be "a very general way" of preserving a video game in some form. "I'm certain it won't be the only one. But I see that. I do see it as something that could be exciting to explore along with other application areas." Cook is unequivocal here, meanwhile. "Think about your favourite game, and think about the footage of it that's on YouTube," he said. "If we were going to learn the game based on that footage, what stuff isn't seen very often? What stuff is maybe not seen at all? Maybe there's secrets no one's ever found. Bugs, glitches. "And also on maybe a stupider kind of level - but still important to think about - is things like when dataminers find cut content from Elden Ring. Or how if you look in very old games, you can find comments in the codebase from developers who are working at 4:00am and writing messages in the code. That stuff obviously can't be locked, can't be recovered, because the computer can't see it." An analogy he offers here: "The Globe Theatre that I walk past is not the real Globe Theatre. It's still useful that we built it. But it would be great if we also had the original." Hypothetically, he adds, even if this method got "99 percent of the way there, ultimately it isn't the same as actually recording the code base, for a million and one reasons." The next suggestion here feels like less a piece of executive ad-libbing, and more a central to Microsoft's core pitch for Muse: "gameplay ideation" - a rather corporate term for, essentially, thinking up stuff you can do in a game. Muse is explicitly being touted as a potential tool for helping with this, but crucially, and as we've already clarified, it's not coming up with ideas or inventing gameplay itself in any way. "There are philosophical questions around: can models be creative?" Hofmann said, when I asked her to clarify. "And I'm quite firmly on the side that they are not. I've seen a lot of confusion around that in the literature. But by framing Muse as: it is a simulation of an existing video game, I think that quite firmly emphasises that the model in itself is not creative." What the research team was instead aiming to achieve, after conversations with developers internally at Microsoft, "was exactly to tease out the model capabilities that could unlock human creativity." In other words, the team is attempting to figure out how models like this, if they were to become faster, more efficient, more accurate and so on, might be useful to human developers in the future. In this case, it comes back to the initial demonstration of Muse with Bleeding Edge, where you could drag and drop something into the game - a jump pad, an explosive barrel, an enemy - and then quickly see how that plays out. Is that actually feasible as a method of seriously prototyping game ideas, and even if it was, would it actually be helpful? With the first question, Hofmann describes the output of the current version of the model as "not-fully-working" and for now only an example of "signs of life", but despite plenty of scepticism from the watching public, her confidence in its ability to improve seems ironclad. That confidence is based on what Hofmann believes to be genuine discoveries in how these models can operate, she explains, such as gaining an understanding of "how we can curate data to craft - or to train - models that capture those structural relationships in the data." By "structural relationships", she adds, what she specifically means is "the understanding of how this model is able to translate an image into numbers, and then learn how those numbers relate to each other." In the simplest possible terms, Hofmann feels the team has learned how being specific with training data in certain ways can give you much more reliable outputs, and with less data required. That newfound understanding has "opened up this really big space around how specifically curated data sets and multi-modal models interact with each other, and the kinds of structures they're able to learn." When does that potential become actual, usable reality for some kind of developer-friendly jump pad-testing tool? There's "a lot of runway", she says, though "I can't give you a timeline. I can't tell you specifically which innovation is going to come after the other, but it's basically opened up this huge, huge space… I cannot see the end of how far we're going to be able to get with that." Whether or not this might actually be useful to developers is another issue, however. Cook, for his part, is sceptical again, suggesting more immediately helpful (and efficient) avenues for this kind of tool might be found in quickly adding a splash of a game's visuals and other details to standard whiteboxing, or adding new forms of immediate, quickfire automatic playtesting that don't currently exist. "Human playtesters exist," he says, "but there are some techniques that require you to have an automatic playtester." Nevertheless, Cook is keen to praise Microsoft for having actually sought input from real game developers, something that Hofmann also repeatedly points to. "One of my favourite things about the paper is that they actually sat down with developers and talked to them," Cook says, "and often they talked of developers that were already very positive about the technology - but they still actually said to them: What would a workflow that looks useful for you be? I thought that was really important and we need more of that stuff." One other, important question comes up here, when it comes to the practical implementation of this kind of hypothetical tool. How could a developer use Muse to simulate adding a new mechanic to an in-development game, when doing so currently requires training Muse on, as in Bleeding Edge's case, about 7000 hours of the already-finished game's footage? Hofmann argues the team has indeed thought of this, and it came up in the conversations the research team had with developers. "We look at: assume a scenario where let's say someone has built out a first level of a new game that they're working on - how little data might they need to train a model like this?" The team is "nowhere near the full version of making that real," she said, "but we now know that we can get away with as little as about 50 hours of gameplay from a given game level to create a really nice, consistent representation in that." The very fact that there is so much uncertainty over possible uses for Muse, however, leads on to yet another, regularly posed query. Isn't this all being done back to front? "A solution looking for a problem" is a criticism regularly levied at all kinds of AI ventures, particularly generative AI ones. In many cases it feels entirely justified. AI-generated video and images, such as those produced by Midjourney and Sora, have thus far failed to find any real purpose beyond generating low-effort memes, objectionable propaganda and disinformation, or unanimous criticism whenever used in relation to a video game. Generative text, such as ChatGPT, has fared better in terms of gaining weekly users, which have landed in the hundreds of millions, but poorly in terms of actually making any money from that (the vast majority of those users use it for free, and using it costs OpenAI a huge amount of money). Text-based gen-AI's main uses seem to remain helping Instagram influencers and spammers to rapidly fill out inessential image captions to game the algorithm, meanwhile, or disrupting more trustworthy Google search results with such valuable advice as eating rocks for good health. Naturally, that same criticism was levied again at Muse after its reveal of the Quake 2 demo. Sos Sosowski, an indie developer, issued one of the most widely-shared putdowns on BlueSky with exactly this. "That's very on-track with [the] AI trend," he wrote. "A solution looking for a problem. It's yet another in a series of "reveals" that is bug-ridden and broken." In talking to Cook and Hofmann, who both work in very different areas of AI-based academic research, I was particularly curious about this. How does the actual timeline of research unfold here? Whose idea was Muse? How did it begin, or change over time? And is it normal to do things this way round, in the academic world, in researching technology first and worry about finding a use for it later? "What used to happen at Microsoft Research Cambridge - I used to know someone who worked there," Cook says, "and they used to joke that they felt like Microsoft didn't know they existed, and in a good way. Because they didn't ask what they were doing with their money, and so the researchers there would just do whatever they were interested in and had a great time doing it." The one exception to that? "The Xbox team that was there - and I think over time, there's been more scrutiny on what the AI teams are doing." He has a few suggestions as to how this initial research might have come to be. Sometimes, he explains, "ideas like this are born out of a single researcher or a hackathon day, or a conversation over coffee." Likewise, "it might have been born out of something more specific," like say, if there's a large data source that's already available. "So it's like: listen, we've got 400,000 hours of people playing this game, there must be something we can do with it." I put the same question to Hoffman, who for her part offered a detailed explanation which seems to quite closely echo some of Cook's best guesses. "Microsoft Research is quite unique, I would say, in that it's a very bottom-up research organisation," she explains. "Our remit is to drive innovation, to drive the start of the art in our respective areas." In practical terms that means combining their research into machine learning with, for instance, "leveraging the rich data that we can in many cases responsibly obtain in video games, where we might be able to get to a scale or a variety that might be very, very difficult to collect in any other application area." That'll be the readily-available data theory, then, and in this case that's down to the End User License Agreement (EULA) that all players agree to when playing games on Xbox. Under that often-ignored agreement, Xbox was able to gather the video data of, for instance, Bleeding Edge gameplay that it used to train its model. This combination of the research area and the available data then melds with the "luxury" of Microsoft being a large, multidisciplinary company. That grants the research team the "opportunity of engaging with the rest of the company and seeing what's on people's minds," as Hofmann puts it, "and so we have those regular conversations with people in the gaming space to understand what limitations, what challenges they're facing. Where do they see things going?" The research team itself then decides, "within the team", how to direct its research. In this case, Hofmann says the notion of something to help with "ideation" was one that came more or less directly from conversations with developers. "Many of them felt that because game development is so expensive, and prototyping is expensive, everyone who mentioned it felt like they did not have the luxury of doing enough ideation and prototyping - which they felt limited the creativity of what ultimately got built," she explained. As for the specific timeline, Hofmann says the research team started discussions with Ninja Theory as far back as 2018, when Microsoft first purchased the developer, in part because the two are simply both based in Cambridge. The team looked at various options, "very much with an open-ended, exploration point of view - so there was never an expectation that any of the things that we do would actually be put into the games." Ninja Theory then offered the gameplay data the studio had collected under the Bleeding Edge EULA to the research team in 2020, the data was anonymised and imported, and the research carried on from there. The specifics of what the team actually chose to do with this data, meanwhile, wasn't fully settled on until the autumn of 2022, when Hofmann returned from maternity leave to a world where LLMs such as ChatGPT had begun to grow in use and public awareness. "The world had changed in AI," she says, "in the sense of, suddenly, the broad population knew what language models were and what they could do… and so we within the team took that step back and said, well, how does that impact our work? What are the next frontiers that we can explore?" Ultimately, they decided, "Well, we know what works for language, wouldn't it be amazing to figure out what happens when we train on a large amount of actual human gameplay data?" Notably, Muse is actually one of two research projects being worked on in parallel by the team. The group, of around 10 to 15 researchers, can usually accommodate around "one to three" projects at a time, Hofmann said, with Muse a "sustained effort over the better part of two years," and more than half the team involved for much of that time. There were in fact "multiple points" during the project where the team almost stopped work on it, with any further progress "in the balance" until the "huge public response" to the paper that was published in Nature back in late February allowed the team to continue. To come back to that core question of whether it's standard practice to work this way round, Hofmann's answer was clear: first that, yes, it is indeed normal. And second, in her view, that her research team actually placed more emphasis on practical uses than most research of this nature normally would. "In terms of the research process, it's very common to be purely curiosity driven," she said. "And in many ways, I see our project as an example of not doing it this way - which is ironic, because a lot of people don't see that. We started from technical curiosity, but as soon as we saw signs of life - of this is what it's able to do - we put together that interdisciplinary team. We did the user research to understand what the capabilities would be, how this ultimately enabled specific use cases, and then we were especially focusing on ideation and early prototyping. While Hofmann is clear about the order in which the research has unfolded, and the level to which developers have been consulted along the way, the elephant in the room is Microsoft itself. Microsoft is one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies, and one which happens to be in an arms race with other, AI-focused tech competitors, as each attempts to justify - and find a way to ultimately profit - from their investments. OpenAI notably lost $5bn last year and is projected to lose double that in 2025, and triple in 2026. In late February it was revealed that Microsoft had backed out of new datacentre leases with a power capacity equivalent to the entire operational IT load of London, potentially signalling a lack of demand to meet its previously planned generative-AI supply. There is, obviously, an incentive for Microsoft to reveal new, exciting things that can be done with generative AI as early as possible. As Cook puts it, while Muse "has some really interesting qualities to it" and there are "things in there that could be useful for developers," those things aren't really the focus of how the research was presented by Microsoft in the first place. "A lot of the positioning does seem to be: positioning yourself as a company that uses AI and that invests in AI and that is on top of AI advances. It does seem to be a shareholders thing." To Cook, the way Muse has been presented in general is a concern. To him, "there's a difference between what the researchers were trying to achieve, and how Microsoft presented it - and in this case, I thought it was very stark. I really felt like they were kind of hung out to dry in some ways." I put this to Hofmann - both the question of why this was being revealed to the public so early, given its "not-fully-working" nature, as Hofmann herself put it, and of whether she felt the team had struggled to communicate what their research actually was. "I think there's as many opinions and drivers of this as we have people in the team, and potentially a lot more," Hofmann laughed, on the topic of going public early. "Part of it comes from the academic research community. Within academic research, there is a drive and incentive and realisation that it's important to be as open as possible," she explains. "A lot of research does not get into the hands of people where they can try something this quickly… we said, 'Okay: there is something here that even has that possibility; a lot of research is not very accessible by definition; so here is something that could be accessible. Let's put it out.'" At the same time, Hofmann agrees it would be "largely accurate" to say there's been some difficulty in properly communicating what Muse is all about. "Our learnings are very much around: how do we explain what's happening here, what the technical capability is? How do we make that very clear? And with anything we explain, we'll never be able to reach everyone, but I'm certainly looking at the social media activity and I'm taking notes of, okay, here's where the confusion is." Hofmann maintains, however, that even though there's still "a lot of confusion around what it actually is and what is the purpose, and a lot of debate around that," there has been positive feedback for the team. "Interestingly, everyone who commented on the technical achievement called it impressive, or [were] even more hyperbolic. So on the technical level I'm really satisfied, because people appreciate the achievement, which is fantastic." That said, Hofmann concedes that the downside of going this early is the impact on the conversation. "It's not something that happens that commonly, even in an age where AI research does move quickly and people do push out an archive white paper or a video demonstration," she says. Typically, when researchers publish something usable, such as an app, members of the public "expect a certain level of product polish, and we're between those. The technology is not ready. We're very explicit - trying to be very explicit - that this is a technical demo where we intend to show what is becoming possible, and how the field is moving." The goal for that, she says, is to at least "give people that background" to be able to then compare progress down the line. "I'm hoping that ultimately, all those steps will lead to both us understanding how to communicate this more clearly, and then also to the public having built up some of that understanding that helps them interpret what's going on there." For all the big questions and elephants-in-the-room we've worked through so far, there is one more cluster to go that is without doubt the biggest: the many questions of ethics. As anyone loosely familiar with AI, particularly generative AI, will already know, there are a number of ethical issues that very justifiably arise with each discussion. The first of those is the matter of plagiarism - or intellectual property rights - which in the case of Muse is slightly easier to put aside. Microsoft owns Bleeding Edge developer Ninja Theory and also Quake 2, via Zenimax, and under the EULA therefore has rights to the gameplay footage used as training data here. (That said, there are of course ethical questions about whether it's right for Microsoft, or any entity, to impose EULAs which collect user data at will on anyone wanting to play their games. And indeed about whether it's right for Microsoft to own such a large share of the games industry today - but these are questions for another time.) More applicable here is the second essential question with generative AI ethics, which is the environmental impact from the sheer amount of energy used to both train the model, and then to use it in practice. "The energy cost is, I would say, more than you would want for an actual player-facing experience," Hofmann said regarding the Quake 2 demo, when I asked her about this. That public demo uses Nvidia H100 GPUs for the inference, which Hofmann describes as "very similar to an LLM, or a chat bot," in terms of energy cost, and similarly for the training process as well. "What's making me optimistic about where we can push this is, one, the insights from those last two months around how little data, how little training, and how small a model we could get away with," she adds, which she claims is "nowhere near the end" right now. "We haven't really optimised this for inference cost, for example, or for more efficient training." "I can't tell you when, but I'm confident this will run on a consumer GPU, or an NPU [neural processing unit] on a mobile phone," she says, giving a rough estimate of "less than two years" until that's possible in terms of inference cost. As for training cost, "the more we learn about how to do this data efficiently, the more we pave the way to something that is truly democratising access to this." I asked Hofmann if she knew the specific numbers involved in terms of current energy cost, either to train or to "play" the model, to which she directed me to Microsoft PR. Microsoft PR told us they did not have anything additional to share beyond what had been published via the company's blog. As far as broader ethical concerns go, this is far from the last of it. Cook, for instance, suggests one less-cited worry with 3D video game gen-AI more broadly: "It feels like it's sort of a long play for moving toward robotics," he says. "Obviously a lot of these researchers are interested in this stuff for their own sake," he notes, but large tech companies - including those beyond Microsoft, such as Alphabet and Meta - are at least partially looking into AI as it corresponds to video games specifically, he says, because "these projects have two features: they work on video data; and they need to have some model of the world when an action is taken. And these two things are also really important for robots." He qualifies this, adding, "I know the Muse team, they're interested in games, they're really excited by this stuff. But I think one of the reasons why we're seeing big tech companies invest more in this kind of game-modelling stuff, and why they often talk about it as "worlds" and things like that, is because games have always been a research platform for other purposes." Less speculatively, there's the more immediate fact that, as Cook puts it, "for lots of the proposals for tools that are powered by AI, their use case seems to be that they would reduce employment. There doesn't seem to be a way around this." Coupled with a growing concern that video game bosses may be implementing AI in their workplaces with a mixture of ignorance and artlessness - one recent report based on a handful of accounts quoted anonymous developers, with one describing it as "an overwhelmingly negative and demoralising force" - there is plenty of reason for those concerns. All combined, it makes for an almighty mixture of ethical, philosophical, scientific and financial questions - which perhaps is to be expected, given the broader state of AI and the public's natural response to it right now. All those issues are only heightened and complicated by this practice of essentially performing scientific research in front of a live audience, be that out of the pure idealism of accessibility or, I can't help but suspect, the business incentive to do so. For Hofmann, it remains a project that, at least to her, is as personally worthwhile as it is anything else. Her hope is that regardless of the ultimate use case, the research may "add to the wealth and breadth of interactive experiences that are available to us," be that through adding these dream-like (or maybe more accurately for the foreseeable: somewhat nightmarish) elements of an AI-generated game simulation directly, as some kind of additional medium for artistic expression, or in just helping developers think up something else entirely. "I love video games; I recently got back into Quake 2," she laughs, "I played Cocoon recently… I don't even define myself as a gamer, but there aren't enough games to satisfy the time I would like to spend playing." For her, she concludes, "if people are able to use this to create something that is meaningful to them, and there are people who enjoy it - if I could play a role in that, I'd be happy." A fellow researcher, I get the sense that Cook remains sympathetic to Hofmann and her team, even if the goals and natures of their research are notably different. I ask him somewhat bluntly, towards the end of our conversation, if he feels people are right in reacting so viscerally to what Microsoft revealed, even with all the communication mishaps, the well-meaning intentions, and the public learning-on-the-fly in mind. "I think it's justified for a number of reasons," he says. "One of the reasons is just simply that people are so burned out and hurt by all of the things that are happening in the space, that I think there's just a general sense of anger and despair. And I think that's completely understandable." The industry has, of course, been going through a prolonged period of unprecedented layoffs and general uncertainty. The people staying in the industry after all this, as Cook puts it, "they're doing it because they truly love it and they want to do it, and so seeing this creative practice that they love treated in a sort of disrespectful way, it hurts them as well. It's not just about the morals or the ethics or anything like that. This is a thing they care about." When it comes to this practice of doing science in public, and how these findings are presented, he adds, "I see that there's a responsibility. The public are not stupid, but they can only work with the information they're given, and often they're given really bad information." "And so we have to think that going with these gut reactions makes sense right now; it's all we've got to work with. And then hopefully over time, in the future, we can slightly start to build trust again and figure out the bits of AI that we want to keep and that we like." A final, forgotten question for Cook is also the most important. "Not even: does it make games better; but do people want it? And they don't have to want it - technology is rejected all the time, for all sorts of reasons," he says. "So with generative AI, the question should just be: do we want this? We don't have to do anything. We don't even have to make games if we don't want to. Sometimes we forget that we do have this power; we can just not have something if we don't want to. And so players should think more about: what do they really want from the future of games? Because they can want anything. They don't just have to want the things that they see in tech demos, at E3. They can build whatever future industry they want."

April 15, 2025 18:33 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart Santa Clara, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santa Clara, California - In February 2025, Meta made headlines by increasing its hiring of engineers, with interview requests surging in that period. As Meta and other top-tier tech companies continue to invest in user experiences, front-end engineering has become a critical area of hiring. Engineers who specialize in crafting fast, responsive, and accessible interfaces are more essential than ever. To learn more visit https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/front-end-engineering-interview-masterclass This hiring spike comes at a time when the broader tech industry is recovering and recalibrating after a wave of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Against this backdrop, Interview Kickstart has updated its Front-End Engineering course for professionals aiming to break into FAANG and other top-tier companies. Designed and taught by current engineers and hiring managers at FAANG+ companies, the course provides a rigorous, structured path to mastering the technical and interview skills that top employers demand. The demand for engineers with front-end expertise is rising steadily, especially for those skilled in modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. According to a 2024 report from the Burning Glass Institute, front-end developer job postings have grown at an average rate of 15% per year since 2020. Companies are prioritizing candidates who not only know JavaScript and CSS inside out but also understand system design, user performance optimization, and cross-platform delivery. Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course covers core fundamentals with an emphasis on data structures and algorithms, a must-have for technical interviews at any elite tech company. Over 5 weeks, learners engage in live classes focused on solving algorithmic challenges, understanding time and space complexity, and approaching problems with optimal solutions. This forms the technical backbone required for any engineer, regardless of specialization. Beyond that foundation, the program includes a dedicated three-week system design module. While many front-end engineers often overlook system design, it is increasingly tested in interviews, particularly for mid-level and senior candidates. The course teaches how to design scalable front-end systems, from rendering pipelines to caching strategies and distributed UI components, which are essential for roles at companies like Meta where products operate at a massive scale. The four-week front-end domain segment focuses on the exact tools, frameworks, and architectures used in modern front-end development. Topics include virtual DOM, component-based design, state management with Redux or Context API, performance optimization, testing, and accessibility, which are all covered through real-world case studies and problems modeled after actual interview questions. Classes are structured around open-ended problems and live feedback, helping participants understand not just how to solve a problem, but how to communicate their thought process effectively during an interview. What sets the Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course apart is its career-focused layer. Interview Kickstart provides 6 months of post-program support, including mock interviews with experienced engineers from companies like Google and Apple. These interviews are tailored to front-end roles and simulate the pressure and structure of actual technical interviews. Participants receive detailed feedback on both technical and behavioral performance. There are also dedicated sessions for resume building, personal branding, and LinkedIn optimization to ensure candidates stand out to recruiters and hiring managers. The course is built with working professionals in mind. Each week includes asynchronous foundational content, a timed test and review session, and a four-hour live class on Sundays. Between Monday and Wednesday, learners work on practice problems and attend doubt-clearing sessions, with continuous access to instructors for 1:1 coaching. The program recommends 10–12 hours per week for full participation, balancing structure with flexibility. As companies like Meta increase hiring for engineering teams, and as user experience becomes an even bigger differentiator in product strategy, the need for well-prepared, technically sharp front-end engineers is only going to grow. Interview Kickstart's Front-End Engineering Interview Masterclass offers a direct path to capitalize on this demand. By combining top-tier instruction, real-world practice, and structured interview coaching, the program helps engineers not only improve their skills but translate them into high-paying roles at the companies shaping the future of tech.

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resources. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Title: VMware closing a door opens up new VDI possibilities

VMware's fall is leading organizations to explore alternative VDI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There has been increasing attention on open and closed technologies in relation to the development of AI and large language models (LLMs) in the past few years. Meta released Llama as open source, XAI released GROK-1 and, of course, the open source release of China’s DeepSeek model in recent months has been widely publicized. It’s evident that open source technology benefits from community adoption and development, enabling faster iteration, greater security testing and the contributions of many more active minds, experiences and skill sets. Whether the recent LLM releases are driven by such beliefs or by commercial instincts (likely both), it certainly helps in preventing a single player from dominating the market. This perspective was highlighted by the ironically named OpenAI trying to stifle DeepSeek adoption in recent weeks. Co-Founder at Inevidesk. The tensions of open versus closed technologies have long existed in less sensitive, yet still important, areas. Closed technologies tend to be much more widely adopted as they are more easily packaged and deployed and require less depth of expertise. This can lead to monopolies of the type exemplified by Microsoft or Adobe, whose dominance stifles any real competition; the sheer weight of users and finances might preclude serious challenges. In other areas there might not be monopolies, but still a general market domination by a handful of vendors. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a good example, where VMware and Citrix have shared the spoils for many years. And if their dominance has been challenged in recent years, this has been due to the growth of cloud hyperscalers which, for the most part, were extensions of existing global, powerful big tech such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. This state of play is starting to shift somewhat, driven in part by dissatisfaction and distrust of the cloud giants (almost certainly concentrated further by their involvement in AI). This is causing many organizations to ‘reshore’ on-premises or cloud hosted in their own private data center. This dissatisfaction has been fueled by the slow collapse of VMware - perhaps the most well known and widely used of the legacy VDI vendors. VMware was purchased by Broadcom in November 2023, who almost immediately announced several changes including the divestment of their end user computing (EUC) which included Horizon VDI services. The EUC business was subsequently purchased by KKR, a global investment firm, that now offers VDI services under the ‘Omnissa’ brand. The lack of interest shown by Broadcom in the EUC service is a huge knock in confidence for the continued viability of this model, which is not profitable enough for them. It’s uncertain whether the software can be revived under new ownership and there have been worrying indications. Last year, Gartner warned of uncertainty regarding Omnissa’s roadmap and continued semi-dependence for many users on other VMware products. Concerns are currently compounded by recent large-scale layoffs which in one sense should be expected as a post-sale reconstruction, but of course could easily result in the loss of critical internal expertise and a drop in service levels. The recent upheaval has also caused issues concerning price increases and significantly lengthy waits for renewal quotations. Such concerns are driving customers towards other options and, with Citrix remaining complex and expensive and certainly out of the reach of many SMEs, we are seeing a rise of open source related solutions starting to emerge. Many organizations are now offering KVM-based solutions which both avoid the increasing risks and expense associated with the legacy vendors to offer more accessible, flexible and cost-efficient VDI services. Changes in Microsoft virtualization access licensing in recent years helped open possibilities in the space, which has allowed for more efficient use of hardware and more bespoke options. There are industry specific services arising to serve architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), media production and other compute heavy sectors as well as more generalist, knowledge worker options for finance, law and similar businesses. As VDI offers the potential for higher levels of security, more efficient estate management and greater flexibility in our continuing challenging economic climate, this is to be welcomed. Innovation is critical for a healthy technical ecosystem and the ability to address specific industry requirements, whilst also continuing to focus on lowering carbon impacts and creating greater resilience. Businesses and channel operators should be open to such possibilities and actively engage with potential future partners to support development and mitigate the likelihood of monopolies and big tech dominance. We can see the overreach of some of these players in the news every day; supporting independent innovators is a proactive means of preventing an overgeneralization of power and its associated risks.
