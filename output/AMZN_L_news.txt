A Look Back on The Best and Worst Industries for Job Seekers in 2024 In a year marked by technological breakthroughs and shifting consumer preferences, certain industries have emerged as clear frontrunners in the global economy. From artificial intelligence disrupting traditional business models to healthcare innovations addressing growing demographic demands, 2024 has witnessed remarkable growth across several key sectors, even if it’s felt like a tough market for job seekers. On the other hand, traditional industries have struggled to keep pace with the evolving business environment, facing challenges from automation, changing consumer behaviors, and digital alternatives. Let’s take a look back on the best and worst industries for job seekers in 2024 and prepare for the new year. It’s no surprise that AI has established itself as the undisputed leader in industry growth. With private investment in generative AI projects reaching an astounding $25 billion in 2023, according to Stanford University research, the industry shows no signs of slowing down. The AI market is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027, driven by widespread adoption across sectors, marking AI a hot industry for those looking at an upcoming job search. Healthcare continues to dominate job creation, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting it will account for 45% of all U.S. job gains over the 2022-2032 decade. The sector's growth spans multiple areas, from personal care aides to nurse practitioners and medical service managers. Healthcare is a great industry to look into, even if you don’t have a traditional healthcare background, as healthcare organizations will need operational and technological support as they continue to scale. E-commerce has further solidified its position as a cornerstone of the retail economy, with the Census Bureau reporting that the industry reached a valuation of $1.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and that number keeps climbing. E-commerce accounts for 16.2% of global retail sales as of Q3 of this year, totaling $288.8 billion for Q3 alone, a 7.5% increase from 2023’s Q3 numbers, representing a significant shift in consumer shopping habits. This growth in e-commerce has created robust demand for roles in logistics, supply chain management, and digital marketing. The cybersecurity sector has become increasingly critical over the last few years with the fluctuation of remote, hybrid, and return-to-office shifts. The industry has responded to a troubling $8 trillion in cyber attack losses in 2023 with robust growth in security solutions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 32% growth in information security jobs over the coming decade, with information security and cybersecurity professionals commanding average annual salaries exceeding $120,000. The travel industry has shown remarkable recovery after the pandemic, with the World Travel & Tourism Council reporting an increase of 27 million global tourism jobs in 2023. Air travel, hotel occupancy, and international tourism have returned to near pre-pandemic levels, and could hit a new record this Thanksgiving, as about nearly 80 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles away from home during the holiday. The travel industry is vast and incorporates hospitality, transportation, and tourism, and many roles are needed across all sectors within this industry, from sales, marketing, development, logistics, customer service, and more. As organizations invest in infrastructure upgrades, commercial office space focused on employee engagement during return-to-office mandates, and leveraging sustainability practices, the construction industry is in demand. Construction companies that are innovative and provide unique solutions, such as mobile offices, modular and shared spaces, and buildings that can be adaptable for multiple uses, will be in high demand. This industry will be in need of creative tradespeople, innovative leaders, and real estate experts who will be able to partner with organizations looking to grow their physical footprint. With the rise of automation, robotic processing, and 3D printing, advanced manufacturing transforms production by driving productivity, efficiency, and total units produced. Advanced manufacturing is responsible for producing cutting-edge products across almost every industry and is creating a host of new roles from supply chain management, engineering, systems and team management, technology, process improvement, and more. The renewable energy sector has maintained strong momentum, accounting for 10% of global GDP growth, approximately $320 billion, in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. The Inflation Reduction Act's substantial funding for clean energy projects has created numerous opportunities across the sector, from solar panel installation to engineering and supply chain management. It remains to be seen if this will continue to be a growth industry during the upcoming administration. There are several key factors that have fueled explosive growth in these industries: Technological advancement is the most significant driver, transforming how businesses operate and consumers engage with products and services. The rapid evolution of AI, machine learning, and renewable energy technologies has created new possibilities for automation and efficiency while developing entirely new business models and service offerings. Changing consumer preferences have played a pivotal role, particularly in accelerating digital adoption and environmental awareness. The post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior has permanently altered how people shop, work, and access services, benefiting industries that facilitate digital interactions and remote capabilities like telehealth and e-commerce. Recent government policy and regulatory support have provided crucial momentum, particularly in sectors like green energy and healthcare. The financial support for clean energy has created a robust foundation for sustainable industry growth, while healthcare legislation has helped expand access to services and drive innovation in patient care and medical treatments. Demographic shifts have emerged as another significant growth driver, particularly in healthcare and related services. An aging population, combined with increased life expectancy, has created sustained demand for medical services, home care, and innovative health technologies. The technology sector has faced perhaps the most significant headwinds in 2024, with widespread layoffs affecting industry giants and smaller players. Tech companies have been particularly aggressive in workforce reductions, with major players like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM all announcing significant reductions in force. Cisco Systems alone cut 7% of its global workforce as part of a restructuring plan in August of this year, while Amazon has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs across divisions, including AWS, Prime Video, and MGM Studios. The automotive industry has shown significant signs of stress, particularly in the electric vehicle segment. Tesla announced plans to cut more than 10% of its global workforce in April, citing duplication of roles and the need for organizational streamlining. This was followed by Lucid Motors reducing its workforce by 6%, highlighting the challenges facing EV manufacturers in an increasingly competitive market. Media and entertainment companies have experienced substantial contractions throughout 2024. Paramount Global cut 3% of its workforce, roughly about 800 jobs, as the company navigates the decline of traditional cable television. The Los Angeles Times laid off 94 journalists, while Pixar Animation Studios reduced its workforce by 14%, impacting about 175 employees. These cuts reflect the industry's struggle to adapt to changing consumption patterns and the shift toward streaming services. As businesses evolve, job seekers need a strategic approach to capitalize on emerging opportunities. There are many ways to do that, but here are the top ones to have in mind: Start by developing a comprehensive job search plan that aligns with current market demands. High-growth areas like cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare services deserve particular attention as these sectors continue to show demand. Be sure to set goals in your search, like specific salary expectations, desired benefits, and preferred work arrangements, and determine what is a non-negotiable and what you can negotiate on to enable you to focus on what’s most important to you and your career growth. Beyond understanding basic company information, investigate workplace culture, industry trends, work policies, and technological adoption rates. Learn how you can make an impact within your industry or a new one by pointing out your transferable experience, the impact you’ve made at past companies, and leading with your results and achievements. Additionally, with only 10% of job listings offering remote options despite receiving 46% of applications, carefully evaluate your flexibility requirements regarding work arrangements and factor this into your search strategy. Develop your personal brand with particular emphasis on impact, results, transferable skills, and soft skills. With 79% of leaders believing technical skills have a five-year shelf life, companies increasingly value adaptability, executive communication, and leadership potential. Your personal brand is not just your resume but how you’re showing up and contributing to your industry. Create a powerful LinkedIn profile with content that showcases these abilities, and ensure your digital presence aligns with your career objectives. Cohesive, clear, and direct branding will help eliminate confusion for hiring managers and recruiters. If you’re struggling, hire a career coach or resume writer that you trust to tell your career story with you. The investment can have long term benefits for your career beyond landing your next role. While online job boards remain the go-to for job seekers in their search, it’s increasingly becoming the lowest return on your time and energy investment. Between ghost jobs, automatic rejection emails, and recruiters inundated with resumes copied and pasted from the job description, networking has become increasingly important when it comes to landing your next role. Attend industry conferences, participate in professional communities, and leverage LinkedIn for industry connections. 84% of companies believe that employee referrals are the most cost-effective way to hire, according to a study done by Aptitude Research, and referrals are ranked as the number one top source of hire. Employee referrals also account for a 62% reduction in time-to-fill a role, a 24% improvement in the candidate experience, a 2X improvement in first-year retention, and a 2X more likely improvement in the quality of the hire. This shows that companies see the value in employee referrals across strong and weak economies, and referrals tend to be the highest-valued hire. If you’re considering entering a job search at the beginning of the year, having the right strategy is important, which includes understanding what industries will be in demand, how to adapt to these career shifts, maintaining a clear focus on your objectives, and leveraging the right strategy to separate yourself from the crowd of job seekers clogging the job boards by leveraging networking and referrals.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

Title: Are Return-To-Office Mandates About Efficiency Or Cutting Costs?

Trying to find a balance isn't getting any easier. The Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental governing body headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is taking on remote work for government employees. The move by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce pushes back on remote work—especially if government workers quit as a result of the initiative. While 18% of the Fortune 500 companies require 100% full-time in-office work, it’s no secret that removing remote work as an option is reducing the workforce. A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term”, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers’ balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that’s the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That’s a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today’s workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders’ (or constituents’) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, “Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?” That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that’s why it’s called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the “conflict of the wages”? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term”, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers’ balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that’s the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That’s a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today’s workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders’ (or constituents’) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, “Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?” That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that’s why it’s called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the “conflict of the wages”? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it’s going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street’s target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn’t prevent Snowflake’s loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That’s up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it’s now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. “We’ve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,” Ramaswamy said. However, the company’s chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street’s target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. “We feel good about what we’re doing, and we think there’s a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,” he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake’s recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake’s cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. “Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,” he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company’s strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. “As an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,” the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise’s hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. “Snowflake’s growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,” the analyst pointed out. “On the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.” The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn’t reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo’s tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake’s data warehouse. “By bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures — unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,” Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake’s hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic’s most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake’s AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake’s executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic’s Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake’s AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. “Our partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,” Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake’s stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.

Title: What Trump 2.0 means for tech and AI regulation

MIT professor Max Tegmark and Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson discuss what AI policy might look like under the next Trump Administration at the 2024 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Camille Tuutti Stay Connected By Camille Tuutti A second Trump administration could reshape U.S. and global tech industries, with deregulation, artificial intelligence safety and Elon Musk’s growing influence at the forefront. These potential shifts were discussed at Lisbon’s Web Summit during the Nov. 12 session “A New Trump Era,” moderated by NPR CEO Katherine Maher. “Pod Save the People” host DeRay Mckesson and “West Wing” actor Richard Schiff explored how Trump’s second presidency might impact the tech world. Schiff began the session by comparing tech’s growing influence to that of the oil industry, highlighting its ability to drive policy and accumulate wealth. “I think Elon Musk has already doubled his wealth since last Tuesday,” he said. “And tech to me . . . might very likely be the new oil in that it's going to affect policy because the money is there and the power is there.” Schiff said he doubted the Trump administration would regulate tech or address monopolies, a stance he said benefits the industry but raises equity concerns. “The most important tech person in the world has now become the shadow vice president and, if not more, so I think the tech industry is going to get whatever they want,” he said, referring to Musk. “Are we going to stop monopolies? Probably not. Are we going to regulate? Probably not. Maybe that's great for tech, I don't know. I don't know how good it is for the world, the country.” Mckesson turned the conversation to Musk’s leadership, criticizing his tenure at X for making the platform more ideological, despite Musk’s claims to oppose such tendencies. He compared Musk’s polarizing approach to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s growing reputation as a more moderate leader. “[Zuckerberg] was a villain for so long in Silicon Valley,” Mckesson said. “Now, he's sort of the sane person left standing, it seems. So it'll be interesting to see what he does with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — these places that are in the ecosystem that is not Twitter.” Maher then shifted the discussion to AI, asking whether a stronger AI sector could bolster national security. Schiff offered a cultural perspective, suggesting that tough times often ignite creativity. “The silver lining, for me, might be that in authoritarian societies, the best art comes out of the more compressed artists feel, the more expression they end up having,” he said. “There's that darkness that there's light somewhere.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration At a Nov. 13 panel titled “Did Elon Musk Destroy Twitter?” panelists examined Musk’s leadership style and its implications as the proposed head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Kate Conger, a New York Times tech reporter, argued Musk’s drastic cost-cutting measures at X could serve as a blueprint for how he might address federal bureaucracy. “Musk's campaign to downsize Twitter is really a model for what he wants to do for the federal government, and in a lot of ways, it's empowered him to pursue this role,” she said. She pointed to Musk’s perceived success in maintaining X operations after massive layoffs that gutted 75% of the workforce. “Despite some small outages, it still has continued to run, and so he must feel very empowered by that and feels that he can make these deep cuts to the government and bureaucracy,” she said Ryan Mac, another New York Times tech reporter, brought up Musk’s potential conflicts of interest leading DOGE. Tesla and SpaceX, both of which rely on federal contracts, are under at least 20 federal investigations, according to NYT reporting, he said. As DOGE head, Musk could wield significant influence over the agencies regulating his companies, Mac added. “If there is a situation at the [Federal Aviation Administration], which oversees Tesla and SpaceX, could [Musk] have his finger on the scale to change what the FAA does?” Mac asked. “We just don't know. I think that potential is pretty scary.” AI policy and power concentration Trump has suggested rolling back President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI, a move that could shutter the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the institute addresses risks to national security, public safety and individual rights. During the panel “Is AI the Answer or the Problem?” Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson explored whether Musk’s outspoken concerns about AI risks might influence Trump to adopt stricter AI policies instead of loosening regulations to compete with China. She asked MIT professor Max Tegmark if Musk’s views could shape Trump’s approach to AI governance. “I hope so,” Tegmark said, stressing the need to educate leaders about AI’s dangers. “You don't actually need to persuade them that they shouldn't want to be replaced by and dominated by some new weird machine species. They are already against that. It's just a matter of education.” Tegmark expressed optimism that Musk could help Trump grasp the national security risks posed by uncontrolled AI and the economic importance of building safe, manageable AI. “I'm definitely hoping that Elon can help Donald Trump understand that this is just not in America's national security interests that American companies build something that we lose control over in two years, and that the real path to prosperity in America and even strength is to build AI tools that can be controlled,” he said. Olson also highlighted the growing concentration of AI power, pointing out how companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google are snapping up smaller startups. Tegmark identified two major risks: the dominance of a few companies and humanity losing control over powerful AI systems. Despite these concerns, Tegmark ended on a hopeful note, highlighting AI’s potential to solve global challenges if developed responsibly. “With AI, there's so many things we would love to do but just haven't figured out how to do — prevent our loved ones from dying of diseases and safeguard our climate and so on and so forth,” he said. “And if we can get this right with tool AI, we can have a more amazing future than we ever dreamt of.” This year’s Web Summit attracted over 71,500 attendees from around the globe, according to a LinkedIn post by the event's organizers, including industry leaders, policymakers and innovators.

Title: Inside Amazon's agonizing attempt to save Alexa with AI

Your browser does not support the video element. Amazon's Alexa seems like the perfect product for the generative AI era. Getting this powerful technology to actually work well with the digital assistant is a monumental challenge that's been plagued by gnarly technical problems and repeated delays. Customer-friction concerns, partnership hiccups, compatibility questions, latency problems, and accuracy issues have snarled progress, according to internal Amazon documents and multiple people involved in the project. The Alexa team is under immense pressure to get something out. A decade ago it launched with Echo speakers and became a household name. But that early success fizzled and the business has so far failed to become profitable, leading to drastic cutbacks and layoffs in recent years. Some company insiders consider this AI moment to be a seismic opportunity for Alexa, and potentially the last chance to reignite consumer interest in the voice assistant through the power of large language models. A product of this scale is "unprecedented, and takes time," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. "It's not as simple as overlaying an LLM onto the Alexa service." One of the main challenges facing the new Alexa relates to how the digital assistant will interact with other companies and services, and who is responsible for customers if their requests, orders, and payments don't go smoothly. In late August, Amazon was working on integrating 8 third-party applications, including Uber and Ticketmaster, into the upcoming AI-powered Alexa to handle various user inquiries. At that time, the goal was to launch the new Alexa around mid-October, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. However, it was still unclear which companies would be responsible for customer support issues, like payment and delivery errors, this document stated. The lack of clarity could cause Amazon to send "frequent" customer contacts to the partner companies. Then, those partners would sometimes redirect the users back to Amazon, the document explained. "This level of support would cause significant customer friction, when some of the orders/purchases are time-sensitive (meal orders or rideshare trips) and purchase mistakes can be expensive (e.g. buy Taylor Swift tickets)," the document said, assigning it a "RED" warning. Snafus like this have caused Amazon to push back the release date, almost on a weekly basis, according to some of the people involved in the project, which has been codenamed "Banyan" or "Remarkable Alexa." BI's sources asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to talk to the press. For example, without more clearly defined responsibilities with third-party partners, Amazon expected further delays in the launch. "Alignment on customer support plans between Product teams and the 3P partners may push this timeline further out if any delays occur," one of the documents warned. The company had once planned for a June launch, but after repeated delays, it told employees late last month that the new Alexa would launch "no earlier" than November 20, one of the documents said. A few of people BI spoke with recently are even talking about the Alexa upgrade rolling out in early 2025, which would miss the key holiday period. Bloomberg earlier reported on a 2025 launch plan. As of late October, Amazon had not settled on an official brand for the updated voice assistant, and instructed employees to simply call it the "new Alexa" until further notice, one of the documents said. To be sure, Alexa has significant long-term potential in the generative AI era — as long as Amazon can iron out problems relatively quickly. Time is of the essence, partly because the existing Alexa business has lost momentum in recent years. According to a recent report from eMarketer, user growth for major voice assistants, including Alexa, has declined significantly in recent years. The sudden rise of ChatGPT has showcased what is possible when powerful AI models are integrated smoothly with popular products that consumers and companies find useful. Some Amazon leaders are bullish about the AI-powered Alexa and a new paid subscription service that could come with it. At least one internal estimate projected a 20% conversion rate for the paid subscription, one of the people said. That would mean that out of every 100 existing Alexa users, roughy 20 would pay for the upgraded offering. Amazon doesn't publicly disclose the number of active Alexa users but has said it has sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices. An internal description of the new Alexa shows Amazon's grand ambitions: "A personalized digital assistant that can handle a wide range of tasks, including drafting and managing personal communications, managing calendars, making reservations, placing orders, shopping, scouting for deals and events, recommending media, managing smart home devices, and answering questions on virtually any topic," one of the documents said. Customers will be able to access the new Alexa "through natural language using voice, text, email, shared photos, and more across all their devices like Echo, Fire TV, mobile phones, and web browsers," it added. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar vision during last month's earnings call, saying the new Alexa will be good at not just answering questions, but also "taking actions." In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said the company's vision for Alexa is to build the world's "best personal assistant." "Generative AI offers a huge opportunity to make Alexa even better for our customers, and we are working hard to enable even more proactive and capable assistance on the over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world. We are excited about what we're building and look forward to delivering it for our customers," the spokesperson said. Still, the project has grappled with several challenges, beyond customer friction and partnership problems. Latency has been a particularly tough problem for the AI Alexa service. In some tests, the new Alexa took about 40 seconds to respond to a simple user inquiry, according to three people familiar with the test results. In contrast, a Google Search query takes milliseconds to respond. To speed up, Amazon considered using a smaller AI model, like Anthropic's Claude Haiku, to power the new Alexa, one of the people said. But that dropped the quality and accuracy of the answers, leaving Amazon in limbo, this person said. In general, smaller language models generate quicker responses than larger models but can be less accurate. Amazon had initially hoped to use a homegrown AI model, one of the people said. Last year, Alexa head scientist Rohit Prasad left the team to create a new Artificial General Intelligence group at Amazon. The stated goal of the new team was to create Amazon's "most expansive" and "most ambitious" large language models. However, this AGI team has not produced notable results so far, which led Amazon to consider Anthropic's main Claude offering as the primary AI model for the new Alexa, this person said. Reuters previously reported that Amazon was going to mainly power Alexa with Claude. Amazon's spokesperson said Alexa uses Amazon Web Services's Bedrock, an AI tool that gives access to multiple language models. "When it comes to machine learning models, we start with those built by Amazon, but we have used, and will continue to use, a variety of different models — including Titan and future Amazon models, as well as those from partners — to build the best experience for customers," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also added a note of caution by highlighting the difficulties of successfully integrating large language models with consumer applications. These models are great for conversational dialogue and content creation, but they can also be "non-deterministic and can hallucinate," the spokesperson added. Getting these models "to reliably act on requests (rather than simply respond) means it has to be able to call real-world APIs reliably and at scale to meet customer expectations, not just in select instances," the spokesperson explained. In late August, Amazon discovered several new risk factors for the AI Alexa service. Only 308 of more than 100,000 existing Alexa "skills," or voice-controlled applications, were compatible with the new Alexa, presenting a "high risk for customers to be frustrated," one of the documents explained. Some older Echo devices would not be able to support the AI-powered Alexa, the document also warned. And there were no plans for expanding the new service to dozens of overseas markets where Alexa is currently available, leaving a large user base out of touch, it also noted. Fortune previously reported some of these risk factors. As of late August, Amazon had 8 "confirmed" partner companies to handle certain tasks for the new Alexa, as BI previously reported. The company hopes to onboard roughly 200 partners by the third year of the new Alexa's launch, one of the documents said. Integrating with some of these companies has already created headaches. One document said that Amazon struggled to develop a consistent troubleshooting process across every partner service. Companies including Uber, Ticketmaster, and OpenTable have deprecated their existing Alexa skills, further disconnecting them from the voice assistant. Amazon's spokesperson said that, as with any product development process, a lot of ideas are discussed and debated, but "they don't necessarily reflect what the experience will be when we roll it out for our customers." Amazon has also anticipated customer complaints, at least in the early launch phase. One internal document from late August stated that the new Alexa was projected to receive 176,000 customer contacts in the first three months of its release. At one point, Amazon considered launching a new automated troubleshooting service for issues related to its devices and digital services, including Alexa, according to one of the internal documents. That was later shelved. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip? Contact the reporter, Eugene Kim, via the encrypted-messaging apps Signal or Telegram (+1-650-942-3061) or email (ekim@businessinsider.com).

Title: Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/19/streaming-tv-enshittification-will-continue-until-morale-improves/
Time Published: 2024-11-19T13:29:26Z
Full Content:
Failures We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&T–>Time Warner–>Warner Brothers Discovery merger process has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands. What was supposed to be a gambit by these companies to dominate streaming TV, wound up being a very expensive act of seppuku by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths. With streaming subscription growth saturated, the market has been forced to get “creative” in order to feed Wall Street its expected quarterly returns. That has meant sagging quality control for streaming services like Max, and a steady parade of price hikes that generally haven’t been worth it. Speaking on the company’s recent conference call, Time Warner Discovery executives are making it clear that all manner of new restrictions and price hikes are on the way, just in case you were looking forward to more of that sort of thing. Among them will be a crackdown on the diabolical “password sharing” the industry used to view as helpful free advertising: “During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it’s gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with “very soft messaging” toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said. Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” Executives say they’re also exploring, like Amazon, steadily increasing the number of ads paying customers see. And they will, of course, just be rising prices steadily until they see a mass exodus of subscribers: “WBD also hinted at potential price hikes for Max today. During the earnings call, JB Perrette, WBD’s CEO and president of global streaming and games, noted that although Max has raised US subscription prices twice in the past two years, WBD believes it can get away with even higher prices: “We think the premium nature of our product in particular lends us to be – to have a fair amount of room to continue to push price.” Except the “premium nature” of the product doesn’t exist anymore. Any cachet enjoyed from the HBO brand has largely been killed off thanks to executives’ prioritization of lower-quality reality TV dreck as they pursue lowest common denominator engagement bait at scale. There’s still occasionally good art on Max; but the heyday of HBO as a prestige production empire is long, long dead. Meanwhile the kind of things that customers actually want (lower prices, better quality, better customer service) cost money and erode those sweet quarterly returns. The kinds of things customers and labor don’t want (price hikes, sagging quality, layoffs, weird new restrictions on access) are where the current growth and revenue boosting resides. So guess what you’re going to get. It’s not enough for a publicly traded company to provide an affordable product that people really like. That doesn’t achieve exponential, impossible growth. To get that (or the illusion of that) requires a certain aggressive creativity. And if streaming can’t obtain it via annoying price hikes and restrictions, as Time Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav has made clear, they’ll achieve it with pointless new harmful mergers under Trump. These folks insist they’re just engaging in the cold calculus of cost efficiency, but you’ll notice that excessive and unwarranted executive compensation somehow always avoids scrutiny. Again, I suspect what’s next for the industry is a whole bunch more consolidation and mergers to try and minimize any serious price competition and to nab tax breaks. From there I suspect you’ll start seeing a greater fixation on finding creative new ways to “reduce churn,” which will likely (now that the FTC will be lobotomized under Trump) include complicated new tricks to make cancelling services more difficult. When customers inevitably revolt and flock back to piracy (which is already starting to happen), execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!), and the innovation and disruption cycle will repeat itself all over again.

Since I’d have to pay added fees for more than one service I decided a vpn was the least expensive way to deal with the issue for now. Customer service was utterly useless to deal with this on all of them. I already canceled Netflix because of the price hikes and because the content isn’t worth it and from the looks of it more services are joining it soon. I’m already planning some Plex setup for the kid because we all know where this shit is going to. And a bottle of rum. You have been watching too many videos that are rated “Arrr!” Hadn’t watched Amazon Prime in a while and when I did it literally started with 6 ads. Now I think of it like warming up the air fryer. Hit watch and know I’ve got 5 minutes to do something else. The “premium nature” of the product seems to only be the price. By this logic, the more customers pay, the more it’s worth. And since every service raise their price, the more the market worth. But how to explain to customers that they need to pay to please shareholders they don’t even know? Well, just ask Trump to declare that cancelling a subscription is illegal. TV Industry: “We will merge until your options are content at an infinite price or no content.” I’m wondering why the shareholders don’t sue the WBD Board of Directors over Zaslav’s absurd compensation, considering the stock’s horrible performance. None of the streaming services are “premium” enough to keep me interested for more than a month or two out of every 12 so that’s all I give them. Put them all together, and it’s not even 12 months so sometimes I just watch Hoopla and Kanopy and read a book. execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!) Woke decline wasn’t evident until this past year or late 2023 at earliest. The spastic woke energy that erupted after George Floyd’s death was purposefully directed into the institutions over the next 24 months and then plateaued late 2023 to early 2024 and then started on a slight downward gradient until 10/7. I don’t think Trump will calm things down. But this time I think there are people in his orbit who ‘get it’ and will be very capable and aggressive in terms of how they use the bureaucracy and administrative law. Please define “woke” in objective terms within the context in which you’re using it. Is it too “woke” to provide healthcare to pregnant women who experience difficulties during child gestation? Why is it that so many maga men want to see all women suffer and die needlessly? Is it “woke” to be offended by such hateful actions? A complete misunderstanding. Which seems to be purposeful here. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” “Your body, my choice” will be met with “Your crotch, my boot” Get back to me when the man can say abort, I don’t want to support that child. “I don’t want to support that child.” Well then, keep it in your pants. Is this too difficult for you? Keep your legs closed. Is that too difficult for you? A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy. And yes, historically, considering the number of unplanned pregnancies, it is difficult for some people to abstain. “Try not getting a cold your entire life!” Thanks, doctor dude! A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy Nor is a consenting man consenting to financial burden Then consenting man should consent to wearing a rubber, fool. That’s not a matter of consent, but a matter of law. Genetic donors are typically considered legally required to provide support of some kind. I don’t consent to having to mow my lawn, but the city will fine me if I don’t. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” The only reason you give a shit about women’s sports is so you can exclude a mere handful of people from it. You wouldn’t give a shit otherwise. Hell, you don’t even seem to give a shit about the idea of “biological women” playing in men’s sports⁠—and that’s because I’ve never seen anyone who rails against trans women do the same schtick for trans men. It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it. Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL…There is a reason they don’t. Maybe one day you will figure it out. Figure what out? What does sports have to do with women’s healthcare? Are you addicted to adderall like your hero Donald? Don’t know what it is. But since you are accusing… Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL… There is a reason they don’t. It’s because men needlessly feel ashamed when outperformed by women in any sport. Exactly! Hence the wnba What is a woman? In which context? It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it You make it sound so, binary Adjective; 1) anything I don’t like. 2) anything for the benefit of anyone who isn’t me (see 1). by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths You make it sound like pointless mergers are a bad thing. The executives keep getting over-compensated, so they’re happy. Who gives a fuck that everyone else is unhappy. When customers inevitably revolt Would be nice if we could have that revolt now, and skip this whole cycle of enshittifying. Instead of increasing the subscription count after the password crackdown, for once. Welcome to the USAnian Consumer’s Front. In the old days, TV programs were free to the viewer because networks ran ads. We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. Then we got tired of ads and decided to pay networks to show up content without ads, which led to cable channels such HBO, Showtime, and so on. Then it let to services like Netflix, which had movies and TV shows in one place. But now we have to pay for content AND watch commercials? AND the length of the commercials is as long as, or LONGER THAN, networks TV?? How long will it take until people stop putting up with it? Do the executives not realize that pay services are not essential and it’s only a matter of time before people think the service isn’t worth the money? “Why do people put up with it? ” I don’t It’s all lies anyway We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. No; it was accepted because there was no other choice. If you went to a movie theater, you’d see ads (some called “trailers” because they used to run after the movie, till the advertisers realized everyone was leaving without watching them; and since 1990 or so, there are also just regular paid ads). Books would often have ads for other books by the same author or publisher. Magazines and newspapers were full of advertising, and also abused their subscribers by selling their data to postal and telephone spammers. TV shows were only distributed on advertising-supported networks, whether or not you were paying a cable provider for them, and were never sold; same for radio shows. When networks like HBO and Showtime came around, a small number of people were willing to pay because there were shows they couldn’t get elsewhere; being ad-free was mostly a bonus. Some of the “premium” networks were themselves initially “bonuses” (or forced subscriptions, depending on your point of view) included with cable TV. Similarly for streaming services: they were sold on the basis of being convenient (lots of stuff to watch, no schedules), not being ad-free; and some, notably Amazon, were bundled with unrelated subscriptions. Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves But morale hasn’t got a chance of improving until streaming services are no longer enshittified, so I guess streaming TV is going to die.
