Bengaluru: During the long hours of pandemic-induced lockdown, some of his friends picked up mobile gaming while others discovered short videos on YouTube and Instagram. But for Rohit Agarwal, a garment shop owner from Tumsar, a town in north-west Maharashtra, it was reading a college love story that sparked a new passion. Within weeks, Agarwal found himself spending hours every day engrossed in reading long-form fiction on Pratilipi, a digital storytelling platform. “There were days when I’d start a book post lunch and finish it by midnight," he recalls. New to reading, Agarwal was surprised to discover the addictive joy in captivating stories and the fictional world of romance and love stories. Soon, Agarwal took a plunge and decided to publish his own stories on the platform, a transition quite common on Pratilipi which has an active community of 1.5 million writers and 6.5 million monthly readers. The startup is a user-generated content platform that allows authors to publish their long-form content in multiple Indian languages. Founded in 2014 and backed by investors like Tencent, Nexus Ventures and Alteria Capital, Pratilipi recently reached a milestone of being cash-flow positive in July 2024. Pratilipi’s revenue in 2023-24 rose by 66% to ₹58 crore, from ₹35 crore the year before.The net loss narrowed by 62% to ₹58 crore last year. Overall, the company has raised $80 million in funding over seven rounds. But the company cannot be measured by its finances alone. In the era of 15-second reels and waning attention spans, Pratilipi’s quest to foster a culture of reading long-form regional literature stands out in India’s content ecosystem—an ecosystem that has seen a massive rise and crash in the last half-decade. Several short video apps that emerged in the last few years tanked while some like Moj, Josh and MXtakatak saw mergers. Popular live-streaming apps disappeared after the China ban, while Koo, an Indian version of Twitter (now X), shut shop earlier this year citing a lack of funding or acquisition interest. While these platforms spent heavily on customer acquisition and creator rewards, some failed to take off and others are still struggling to retain users and build sustainable communities. One of the reasons for Pratilipi’s survival in tough market conditions has been its singular focus on long-form content. While other platforms tried to cash in on the market frenzy of multiple formats like short videos and bite-sized content, Pratilipi stuck to its core offering of in-depth, engaging stories in regional Indian languages. This focused effort has helped the platform build a loyal fanbase of millions of readers—primarily women aged between 18-35 years. “Long-form storytelling will never go out of fashion," says Ranjeet Pratap Singh, founder of Pratilipi. Singh’s journey with Pratilipi is rooted in his conviction and confidence that good stories will always find consumers. That said, Pratilpi’s journey hasn’t always been smooth. Wattpad’s playbookBefore founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures. In 2014, when Pratilipi launched, Wattpad, the Toronto-based self-publishing platform, was already recognized among the hottest digital media companies. A rage among teen girls, Wattpad, in its eighth year of running, had attained a cult-like status and began monetization in 2014 after reaching 25 million monthly active users. Borrowing several pages from Wattpad’s playbook, Singh says he knew this was a game of patience and execution. View Full Image A screenshot of the Wattpad reading app. “Our first major challenge was to build demand and supply—a classic chicken and egg problem," says Singh. Pratilipi chose to focus on fixing the supply side first. The company reached out to authors through various channels, imploring them to get published on the platform. Writers such as Abhidha Sharma and Jitendra Jeetu were approached. Despite being published, these authors were having difficulty reaching a wide readership. To build an initial content library, the company also picked up a few hundred Indian language titles that were available in the public domain. This strategy, aped from Wattpad’s playbook, helped the company get the initial traction and readers. Eventually, though, the platform had to prove its merit in the original content market. Singh recalls placing a great emphasis on prioritizing its writers and their experience on the platform. Pratilipi introduced initiatives such as workshops for new writers, fellowships for seasoned authors, author chat rooms and a feedback loop between readers and writers. “One of our biggest initial platform challenges was supporting Indian languages," says Singh. Fortunately, the launch and adoption of the Google Indic keyboard took the load off a tech problem for the company. Pratilipi stories are currently available in 12 Indian languages, including Punjabi, Odia and Bengali. Malayalam and Marathi stories are read the most.

To fix this, the company aggressively marketed through Facebook ads. Authors were also encouraged to share their stories within their network. Community initiatives like chat rooms for authors helped build user retention. All these efforts made traditional book publishers sit up and take notice. “Pratilipi’s success in enabling online reading habits has been an eye-opener, changing the perception of traditional publishers," says Gautam Padmanabhan, chief executive of Westland Books, a company Pratilipi acqui-hired in April 2022 after Amazon announced that it was shutting down the publishing house.Acqui-hire is the practice of buying a company to access employees and their skills.“This has forced us to rethink our approach to digital publishing," Padmanabhan added. Early investors, meanwhile, believed in the monetization potential of the platform. Nexus Ventures was one of them. Pratik Poddar, partner at the venture capital firm, explains that their initial investment was driven by the founders’ passion for creating a literature-focused platform in India. However, the global trend of users paying for long-form content and the potential to monetize intellectual property, as seen in the West and China, solidified their decision to invest. Pay to readFor the longest time, the platform was free; authors weren’t paid. This changed in 2020 when Pratilipi introduced a premium app where subscriptions cost ₹150 a month or ₹1,500 a year. In addition, there is also a ‘Superfan’ subscription where readers can subscribe to specific authors for ₹25 a month or ₹250 a year. The app currently has 400,000 monthly paying users.Pratilipi authors now get paid based on engagement generated by paid users on the app, similar to Spotify. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model, where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and feedback. By default, writers own the intellectual property for any story they publish on the platform. However, the company also acquires a small number of stories that it feels can work across various formats such as audio and web series. Authors still retain a share of the revenue generated from these formats. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model,where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and allows authors to receive ongoing feedback on the plot twists and turns of their narratives. Shelja Shrivastava,who writes in Hindi, is among the top authors on Pratilipi. She recalls hiring an external editor to proofread and edit her story chapters. “I wasn’t getting paid for my stories back then, but I was willing to spend on an editor because I didn’t want to publish a shoddy story," says Shrivastava, adding that user feedback was paramount to her.

A part-time professor and homeopathic doctor, Shrivastava, on good days writes anywhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words over a couple of hours and makes about ₹35,000 per month through the platform. When she is not as active, her earnings drop to ₹20,000 a month. Popular among the genre of social issues and romance, Shrivastava has built a community of 30,000 followers and 27 million impressions on the platform. Time to buy2020 was also when the company pressed the accelerator on diversification. Inorganic growth was in the offing. Pratilipi expanded into audiobooks and comics. That year, it acquired IVM Podcasts, a podcast platform. Pratilipi FM, the company’s audiobook platform, now has 170,000 monthly active listeners, while Pratilipi Comics, which offers digital comics in six Indian languages, has over 80,000 monthly active readers. The Westland acqui-hire, meanwhile, gave the company expertise in physical publishing. And Westland gained from the digital publishing expertise Pratilipi built over the years. Since the partnership, Westland has adaptedThe Habit Coach, a podcast on the platform, into a book. It also adapted Ruskin Bond’sTales From My Heart into a comic book. Six months to liveFor Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses—the runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year—down to ₹6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. During this period, the revenue from Pratilipi’s literature segment remained strong, aiding the company to stay afloat and even grow. In January 2024, the literature segment became cash flow positive, marking a turning point. By July, Pratilipi achieved overall cash flow positivity. Nonetheless, Singh admits to making decisions that have hurt revenue growth. For instance, the Pratilipi app doesn’t have an erotica category—although there is plenty of romance—because many writers on the platform insisted on “keeping the platform family-friendly." The next chapterWhile erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books. Pratilipi wants to capitalize on this trend by expanding its intellectual property across various formats. This move positions them to better compete in the regional content market. The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ₹10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. “Great stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. “Our competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." Before founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures.

For Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses—the runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year—down to ₹6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh. During this period, the revenue from Pratilipi’s literature segment remained strong, aiding the company to stay afloat and even grow. In January 2024, the literature segment became cash flow positive, marking a turning point. By July, Pratilipi achieved overall cash flow positivity. Nonetheless, Singh admits to making decisions that have hurt revenue growth. For instance, the Pratilipi app doesn’t have an erotica category—although there is plenty of romance—because many writers on the platform insisted on “keeping the platform family-friendly." The next chapterWhile erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books. Pratilipi wants to capitalize on this trend by expanding its intellectual property across various formats. This move positions them to better compete in the regional content market. The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ₹10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook.

Title: CVS and Walgreens are ailing. Here’s why
URL: https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:34:11Z

Alina Selyukh Walgreens said Tuesday it would close 1,200 stores. Rival drugstore chain CVS recently laid off thousands of employees to cut costs. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Not too long after Tim Wentworth became CEO of Walgreens, he revealed a stunning figure: Roughly a quarter of the pharmacy chain’s stores do not make money. On Tuesday, he said 1,200 of those stores will close over three years. That’s two weeks after rival CVS announced layoffs of 2,900 corporate staff. Both chains are on a multibillion-dollar cost-saving spree — closing hundreds of locations, cutting thousands of jobs and, really, reconsidering their role in Americans’ lives. The slow simmer of mistakes and misfortunes has come to a boil for the biggest U.S. drugstore chains. They’ve accumulated too many stores at a time of changing shopper habits. They’re saddled with numerous government fines and a particularly ailing relationship with health insurers. CVS and Walgreens have some notable differences. Walgreens, which also owns the British drugstore Boots, is more singularly focused on its pharmacy business. CVS has expanded further into health care through mergers with insurer Aetna and Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager that helps insurers negotiate prescription drug coverage and costs. Yet the two companies have made similar missteps. The simplest part of the problem is scale. CVS and Walgreens grew massive nationwide footprints of more than 9,000 and 8,000 stores, respectively. They gobbled up mom-and-pop shops and signed long-term leases for prime locations on street corners. A chain with a padlock secures freezer doors at a San Francisco Walgreens store in July 2023. The store padlocked its freezers to thwart shoplifters who had been stealing frozen pizzas and ice cream. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Now, shoppers regularly complain about chronically understaffed stores, with products locked up to prevent theft. The shelves of snacks, makeup, greeting cards and cleaning products were meant to boost profits. But sales have sagged for years — a result of a losing battle with Amazon, Walmart, Costco, grocery and dollar stores. CVS and Walgreens “probably do have too many stores because they overexpanded, but the bigger problem is that the stores that they have are not very good,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at the firm GlobalData. The chains have failed to add new incentives for shoppers, beyond photo booths and returns drop-off centers, says Anshuman Jaiswal, a longtime consultant to retailers and pharmacies. And neither chain has built a meaningful online presence designed to give customers what they need. “If you go to CVS.com or Walgreens.com, if you are placing an order for cough syrup, why don't I sell chicken broth as a product recommendation immediately?” Jaiswal says. “It's about reimagining the business model.” Given the retail struggles, pharmacies could perhaps simply ditch the convenience store and focus on selling medicine — except CVS and Walgreens say it’s harder and harder to make a profit from this part of their business. Years ago, a big shift in the power balance between pharmacies and health insurers revealed the limits of drugstores’ leverage. “Historically, there was a view that there was a lot of customer loyalty to their specific retail pharmacy … and that patients, or consumers, would be all up in arms if they were forced to move their prescriptions,” says Brian Tanquilut, health care services analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. Walgreens tested this theory about a decade ago when it got into a public fight with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that worked with major health insurers. Walgreens and Express Scripts played a game of chicken over how much Walgreens should earn from prescriptions — and Walgreens lost. For a time, it got kicked out of insurance networks used by millions of people, who simply went elsewhere to get their medicine at the lower in-network prices. “What that did was to prove that patient loyalty is not to the retail pharmacy, but it actually is whatever my insurance is willing to pay,” Tanquilut says. “And that opened the door for the payers to keep pushing pricing down on retail pharmacy chains.” These days, CVS and Walgreens are facing tough competition from pharmacies that don’t depend as much on profits from prescriptions because they’re part of retail giants, including Walmart and Costco. The drugstore chains also have spent millions of dollars on government fines over allegations of unsafe staffing levels, overbilling government insurance programs and contributing to the opioid epidemic. Over the years, CVS and Walgreens attempted to reframe themselves as health care hubs, expanding primary-care clinics. But these operations cost time and money. On Tuesday, Walgreens CEO Wentworth said his chain is “reorienting to its legacy strength as a retail pharmacy-led company.” CVS is reportedly weighing a breakup to undo its mergers with Aetna and Caremark. Both companies are also proposing new structures for how they want to be paid for filling prescriptions, hoping this is the big shot in the arm they need. "I'm very confident that over a two- to three-year period we will have reset the framework for reimbursement discussions," Wentworth told investors on Tuesday. “We are in the early stages of a turnaround that will take time.” Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: ‘Students are frustrated’: College seniors seeking tech jobs face a chilly hiring market
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/16/tech-industry-job-market-hiring-college-graduates/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:00:00Z

When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work. The signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting. “Students are frustrated,” Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley’s career center, tells Fortune. The unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective. So far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That’s on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year. Things won’t necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers. In a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That’s a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles. In response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today’s computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022. Of any college major, that’s the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake’s report notes. Another report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023. Overall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month. At Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps. “I’m seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,” Pitcher said. At Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers. “They’re still doing tech roles, but they’re doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,” Collins said. Carnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition’s list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley. And while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said. “It’s probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,” Collins said. Madeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she’d already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing. Searching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said. “You can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you’re at a fork in the road where you’re wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?” she said. Brutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley “pure tech” companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: New One Piece, Naruto Games Reportedly Canceled by Bandai Namco

Bandai Namco games involving One Piece, Naruto, and more are supposedly in jeopardy. By Tanner Dedmon Some unannounced games in the worlds of One Piece and Naruto have supposedly been either paused or canceled entirely amid some larger shakeups at Bandai Namco, according to new reports. It’s been suggested that work on these unknown games is uncertain at the moment due to a underwhelming demand, and the games in flux apparently extend beyond anime titles, too, with a Nintendo project currently on hold at Bandai Namco as well. News of the state of these Naruto and One Piece games supposedly in the works over at Bandai Namco comes from Bloomberg which said that the publisher had either halted or canceled some of its projects. Bloomberg speaks of a “lackluster demand,” though it seems the demand here is referring more to games in general as the gaming industry continues to cut costs by canceling projects and laying off workers. There were no references made to a lack of demand for Naruto and One Piece, specifically, which makes sense given that the latter is more popular than ever after Netflix’s live-action Naruto series even if the franchise is currently going on a hiatus. That does made it even stranger that Bandai Namco would be reconsidering a One Piece game, however, given its popularity and the fact that we’ve gotten several One Piece games in the last four years. Bandai Namco publishes tons of anime-themed games — pretty much any of the more modern ones that you can think of — so there’s no telling what kinds of games these One Piece and Naruto projects were. Many of Bandai Namco’s anime games are arena fighters like the wonderful Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero while others are a bit more open like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, but they all typically circle back around to beating up anime baddies. But while anime adaptations may be the publisher’s bread and butter, its work extends beyond that scope as well. Bandai Namco published Elden Ring and other Souls games, for example, and also works with Nintendo on some projects. Two Nintendo franchises Bandai Namco works on are the Mario Kart and Smash Bros. games with a broader team established recently to work closer with Nintendo (though those franchises were not specifically mentioned in the announcement). Mobile games are another focus of Bandai Namco which are also supposedly being impacted by these decisions made internally. Another game, Blue Protocol, was recently confirmed for a shutdown early next year despite having only just released recently. The Western version of the game which was to be published by Amazon has also been canned. As a result of these cancelations and paused games, Bandai Namco is also reducing its workforce with around 200 employees said to be affected. These employee losses also contribute to an already brutal year for gaming studios in terms of layoffs and lost talent.

Title: Walgreens Announces It Will Close 1,200 Stores Across US by 2027

Friends Read Free Pharmacy chain Walgreens announced it will shut down 1,200 stores across the United States over the next three years. Closures of Walgreens stores were announced in June, but the company had not disclosed the number of affected stores at that time. It had more than 8,000 stores in the United States as of Aug. 31 last year. “Our financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 reflected our disciplined execution on cost management, working capital initiatives and capex reduction,” Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in the statement. He said that in the next fiscal year, Walgreens will be “focusing on stabilizing the retail pharmacy by optimizing [the company’s] footprint, controlling operating costs, improving cash flow, and continuing to address reimbursement models to support dispensing margins and preserve patient access for the future.” “This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,” said Wentworth, who was named chief executive officer in 2023. Walgreens, like its competitors, has been struggling for years with tight reimbursement for the prescriptions it sells as well as other challenges such as rising costs to operate its stores. Drugstore chains have also been dealing with more competition from online retail giant Amazon, as well as Walmart and Target. Rival CVS Health Corp. is wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 stores. Another major chain, Rite Aid Corp., emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization earlier this year after whittling its store count down to about 1,300 locations. Walgreens has also been backing away from a plan to add primary care clinics next to some of its stores after launching an aggressive expansion under previous CEO Rosalind Brewer. Walgreens said Tuesday that its net loss swelled to more than $3 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company said softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance hurt operating income. It also booked some hefty charges tied to opioid litigation settlements the company had recognized in previous quarters and an equity investment in China. Walgreens shares rose by almost 4 percent on Tuesday morning before Wall Street’s opening bell. Earlier in October, CVS said it was cutting about 2,900 jobs across the United States as part of a cost-savings program, according to a statement. Those layoffs will mainly impact corporate jobs and will represent fewer than 1 percent of the company’s workforce. The reductions, part of CVS’s previously announced plan, would primarily impact corporate roles and not frontline jobs in stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers, it said.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Japanese video game developer seems to be the latest company not immune to undergoing layoffs and shuttering projects. By Lan Pitts on October 15, 2024 at 9:25AM PDT In a year flush with video-game-company layoffs and restructuring, Bandai Namco has reportedly canceled several titles including games featuring One Piece and Naruto licenses. In addition to those games, there was reportedly an unnamed contract project with Nintendo that has been shuttered as well. In a report by Bloomberg, coinciding with the projects being terminated, it's stated that the company is taking a traditional "Japanese approach to reduce staff and sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily” so they don't receive any form of severance. The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge." Over the summer, the company further shuttered its long-running Tales of the Rays mobile game and said it would take down its MMO game Blue Protoco starting in January. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol," Bandai Namco said in a statement. "Both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world." Bandai Namcon's latest release, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero saw strong initial sales. The game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, sold more than 3 million units worldwide within its first 24 hours after its launch. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: Walgreens is closing 1,200 stores over the next two years

Walgreens is closing more locations. Walgreens is closing approximately 1,200 locations as the drug store chain struggles to contend with online competitors and declining prescription drug payments. By 2027, about one in seven Walgreens currently open will close its doors. About 500 Walgreens will close its doors over the next year, the drug store chain announced Tuesday. Those closures represent a significant escalation from a few months ago, when the financially struggling company announced in June it was shutting 300 underperforming locations as part of a multi-year optimization program under CEO Tim Wentworth. At the time, the company had said about a quarter of Walgreens stores were unprofitable, and the chain promised "imminent" changes. Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts. Major drugstore chains, including CVS and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They've declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term." For Saunders, Walgreens' eliminating the "dead wood will help the company strengthen its financials over time, but it is a huge admission of failure."

Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term."

Walgreens is closing approximately 1,200 locations as the drug store chain struggles to contend with online competitors and declining prescription drug payments. By 2027, about one in seven Walgreens currently open will close its doors. About 500 Walgreens will close its doors over the next year, the drug store chain announced Tuesday. Those closures represent a significant escalation from a few months ago, when the financially struggling company announced in June it was shutting 300 underperforming locations as part of a multi-year optimization program under CEO Tim Wentworth. At the time, the company had said about a quarter of Walgreens stores were unprofitable, and the chain promised "imminent" changes. Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens (WBA) rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts.

Title: Taking voluntary redundancy or getting laid off? You need to know about your tax, welfare and pension options
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/10/15/taking-voluntary-redundancy-or-getting-laid-off-you-need-a-financial-plan-for-the-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Redundancies are common these days. Tech, pharma, finance and consulting workers know the wind can change at brutal speed. You’re sipping your free wellness smoothie one minute and out the door the next. When redundancy is in the ether, it’s good to have a financial plan. Drug giant Pfizer is the latest multinational to announce job cuts here. Some 210 of its workers will go over the next year. TikTok, Wayfair and Flutter announced cuts earlier this year. It was Accenture before that, with 890 redundancies announced last year. This followed cuts at Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Stripe and Amazon. There was a snap cost-cutting cull at Twitter too, with 50 per cent of its Dublin office gone. Those are just the ones that made headlines. Derek Maguire, a financial planner with Financial Architects, gets about six to 10 enquiries a week from workers dealing with voluntary or compulsory redundancy. “The average person coming to us would be on about €100,000, maybe €120,000; they are typically aged 50-plus,” says Maguire. They are skilled and, with the country at near-full employment, they will get another job if they want it, he says. Nevertheless, the prospect of redundancy requires some financial reckoning. “The main questions people ask us are, ‘can I afford to take six months or a year off?’ I hear that all the time. They are flat out and they want a break,” Maguire says. Where there’s an offer of voluntary redundancy on the table, people are nervous of leaving a generous pension scheme. David Looney, a qualified financial planner with Alpha Wealth in Cork, has helped a lot of people dealing with redundancy this year. Most are skilled, well paid and will have the chance of moving to a similar role. “Sometimes it’s about giving them the reassurance that they are in a financial position that they can take a bit of time off,” says Looney. “Some are almost happy with redundancy. It can give them a financial cushion to take some time off work, to travel, pay off the mortgage, or spend time with the kids before taking up a similar role.” Both warn that it’s imperative that those dealing with redundancy don’t rely solely on canteen chats or a colleague’s WhatsApp group for financial advice. Your individual severance package, and your tax, pension and savings position will all shape what redundancy will mean for you. Everyone is different. “I remember a case where one person made the wrong decision about how to take redundancy, and eight colleagues followed them and did the same thing, so they all made the wrong decision,” Maguire says. A severance package might be broken down into three elements, says Looney. The first includes things like holidays you haven’t been paid for, or pay in lieu of a notice period. Maybe you have a bonus due, too. All of this goes through as a normal salary payment. If you are earning over €42,000, or €44,000 from next year, it’s going to be taxed at the top rate. “There’s not a whole lot you can do there, there are no tax-free exemptions,” says Looney. The second element is the statutory redundancy payment. This part is tax-free. Statutory redundancy is the minimum an employer must pay. It equates to two weeks’ gross pay for each year of your service, plus another one week gross pay. The weekly pay, however, is capped at €600. So whatever you earn, this will equate to €1,200 multiplied by your number of years of service, plus €600. The third element is an ex gratia redundancy payment. This is paid at your employer’s discretion. An ex gratia payment of six weeks’ pay per year of service as a lump sum would be typical, says Looney. Part of this ex gratia payment is tax-free and part can be taxable at your marginal tax rate. There are three ways to determine the tax-free part under Revenue rules. There is the basic exemption, the increased exemption and the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) – this is a tax relief that normally benefits people with higher earnings and long service. Your employer will typically crunch the numbers for you and the highest answer will determine how much of the ex gratia payment is tax-free, says Looney. There is another option you have. If, when calculating the tax-free part of your ex gratia payment, the increased exemption calculation or the SCSB is giving the highest tax-free payment, this can mean waiving your right to a future tax-free lump sum from the part of your pension pot related to that employment. “So, sometimes the employee has to tick option A to waive their right and take more of their redundancy payment tax-free now, or else tick option B and retain the right to take a tax-free lump sum from their pension on retirement and, in turn, take less of their redundancy payment tax-free now,” says Looney. [ Pension tax relief rises to cover pots of up to €2.8m by 2029 under Cabinet plansOpens in new window ] It’s a case of deciding, do I want more tax-free now or later? “Sometimes people automatically think, it’s best to get as much as I can tax-free now, but they can end up shooting themselves in the foot down the line, particularly if they have a fairly decent pension,” Looney says. He gives the example of a young tech worker who has built up a pension pot of €100,000. If this grew over 30 years, it would be worth more than €400,000 by the time they reach 60. At that point, they can usually take out 25 per cent as a tax-free lump sum, which is over €100,000. “That can be quite handy down the line for clearing your mortgage or wiping out any debts and basically helping set you up for retirement,” says Looney. Where the pension amount with your employer is small, however, it might make sense to waive the right to the retirement lump sum for that part of your pension and to take more tax-free now as it won’t have a big bearing on your pension, he says. It comes down to cash flow, too. If you don’t have savings and are concerned about being out of work for a long time, you may need to prioritise paying your mortgage. Some workers want to know if they can afford to take a less well-paid, but a less stressful job next, Maguire says. “I spoke to someone on over €120,000 who was asking if she can afford to take an €85,000 job next. She said, I’m killing myself here at the moment. I don’t want to be killing myself.” If you are due a fairly decent severance package, it can come with a big tax bill. One thing you can do to help minimise it is to make a last-minute pension contribution. This has to be done before you leave the company, says Looney. Once you leave an employer, you can’t make a backdated contribution. You could take some of your holiday pay, payment in lieu of notice, any bonus or potentially your severance payment and put that into your pension, says Looney. Your scope for pension contribution is dependent on your age. Someone in their 30s can contribute 20 per cent tax-free. “The whole amount would arrive in to their pension and have the potential of growing tax-free in to their retirement rather than it being taxed through the severance payment,” Looney says. When your role is made redundant, it can be tempting to pull up anchor with that employer entirely – but yanking out your pension pot may not be the best choice. “It can be advantageous to keep your pension pots separate, if you can draw them down at different points in time,” says Looney. “If you move it all into your new employer’s scheme, you might be restricting your fund options and also you may not be able to access your pension pot until you leave or retire from the company,” he says. When you lose your job, register with your local Intreo office or social welfare branch, even if you don’t qualify for an unemployment payment. You may be able to get credited PRSI contributions to avoid a break in your social insurance record. You may be entitled to a tax refund. Those with enough PRSI contributions should qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit. That’s a payment of up to €232 a week, paid for a maximum of nine months, after which you can reapply. There is a sliding scale as to when you can get your first payment. If your redundancy payment is €50,000 to €55,000, for example, you are disqualified from claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit for one week of the nine-month entitlement. Those getting a redundancy payment of €90,000 and over are disqualified for nine weeks. Older workers used to be the ones in the redundancy crosshairs. Some companies operated formulas, notes a company remuneration insider. One veteran tech employer operated the “75″ rule – if your age and your number of years’ service exceeded 75, your number was up. A financial institution operated a policy that if you were over 50 and on more than €50,000, it was time to go. Not all, but some staff looked forward to eventually meeting the criteria to get paid to go. Rolling redundancies are the operating model in many sectors now. “This year, we are seeing redundancy packages to a much younger cohort – within tech companies, for example,” Looney says. “We are dealing with people in their 20s and 30s getting redundancy packages.” As well as company metrics for employee wellness, there are metrics around salary and pension costs, too. When an employee becomes too expensive, says the insider, then comes redundancy. When a shareholder flaps its wings in Silicon Valley or China, it can mean a tornado for workers here. “Some are handpicked, they will get rid of the deadwood, and then they will look at costs. Are there people we can replace, perhaps for a lower salary and pension?” If you wonder why the average age in some companies never edges past 30, it’s not because the employees don’t age. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: I quit Amazon after being assigned 21 direct reports and burning out. I worry about the decision to flatten its hierarchy.

Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a 45-year-old burnout coach in Auburn, Washington, about her experience as a manager at Amazon. It's been edited for length and clarity. I worked at Amazon in the HR space for nearly a decade. Over time, I went from managing zero to 21 direct reports across multiple continents. Being thrust into a managerial role taught me to use my time efficiently and communicate effectively across a diverse network of employees. It was hard, but ultimately, it made me a better leader. I truly love and still believe in Amazon, but I struggled to effectively manage nearly two dozen people and quit in April when my physical health was suffering, and I was burning out. I started at Amazon as a senior launch manager in the grocery delivery space. The job was fast-paced, and I was constantly traveling, overseeing the building of new grocery fulfillment centers. In just two years. I completely burned out and decided to switch career tracks. I landed in HR, which I stayed in for the next eight years of my career at Amazon. I hopped around several HR departments before landing in the heart of HR as a pure business partner in 2019. We had adequate funding, and it was the best-functioning team I've ever been on at Amazon, but I felt there wasn't room to grow. I'd been at virtually the same level for seven years and was looking for a promotion. So, I left Amazon to work in HR at Blue Origin, another Jeff Bezos company. Due to it being a new startup, it was absolute chaos, and I found myself back at Amazon in another HR role a year later, in 2022. I was initially hired as program manager of business continuity to help smooth the transition during a massive organizational disruption. I managed mass layoffs and employee redistribution. Then I was unexpectedly appointed as manager for two teams, which included 11 employees based across China, India, and some of Europe. Managing employees across several different time zones and adding to my preexisting work was difficult. Previously in my career at Amazon, I had managed a maximum of three to four indirect reports. I always prided myself on giving my people an hour of individual virtual face time each week to discuss career development, offer support, and get to know them. I used our meetings as an opportunity to learn what skills employees were looking to develop so I could delegate tasks accordingly. I tried to continue that trend with all 11 of my employees, therefore spending 11 hours a week in individual virtual meetings alone. It was laborious but manageable. A few months later, a coworker went on maternity leave, and I had to take on her team, leaving me with 21 direct reports. My weekly individual meetings were no longer plausible, so I had to cut them in half. Taking on so many employees taught me to communicate more effectively, efficiently, and asynchronously since none of my teams resided in the same time zone. I also learned to adjust and diversify my leadership style, not just for so many people but for so many cultures. I really enjoyed learning more about everyone's cultures to better connect, understand, and lead. Although it was hard, I became a better manager, a better communicator, and a more creative and organized leader. Unfortunately, compressing my time with each employee was detrimental to the success of my teams. Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues. We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development. One of my highest-performing reports came to me and said she was transferring teams because she didn't feel like she had enough time and couldn't work on what she wanted. I gave her my blessing because I would've done the same. I also saw some performance issues popping up on my team because I couldn't give them the dedicated time and feedback they needed to work through problems. For example, several of my employees were struggling to write white papers. This hurt my heart because my job as a manager is to help people overcome obstacles. When you have less time with team members, they get stuck on things longer, and daily processes slow down. Managerial skills don't just magically appear, they need to be learned. Even though I struggled to manage nearly two dozen employees, I feel extremely lucky that I came to Amazon with managerial experience. Before Amazon, I'd worked at Target, where I went through a rigorous management training process. At the time, Amazon required new managers to complete a self-guided manager training course within 30 days. However, even as an experienced manager, I felt overwhelmed by the number of videos I had to watch. Also, I didn't feel that they were the most effective way to learn. I started to burn out from the workload. It's ironic because, as an HR partner, I used to tell incoming employees that no one would ever tell them to go home and stop working, but if they had strong boundaries, people would respect them. That used to be my experience. But I felt responsible for so many people at once, which made it difficult to hold my boundaries. I also stopped enjoying work. My work felt bureaucratic, and I was so focused on staying on top of each little task that I wasn't contributing to things that were moving the needle. I felt like I couldn't be the manager I wanted to be, which was disappointing. So, I decided to officially quit in April. I worry about this fallout continuing as Amazon prepares to flatten its organization in January, but I still believe Amazon can be a magical place full of innovation, autonomy, and creativity. It has always been decentralized, which permits people to move very fast if they have funding, supportive leadership, and a clear, shared vision. Amazon representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.

He cites the corporation’s newfound stability from its recent acquisition by a private equity firm as to why it should now be able to get on a firmer footing. It has been a turbulent two years for MariaDB, with its ill-fated public listing via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022 sending the company into a nosedive it never quite recovered from. Less than two years later, the Milpitas, California-based company was taken private by K1 Investment Management in a $37 million fire sale that was significantly below its opening day market cap of $368 million — which in turn was way below its peak private valuation of $672 million. Last month’s transaction means that MariaDB’s shares are no longer trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), though the three-month de-registration process means that the company is still technically public through early December. However, with a new CEO already in place in the form of ex-Micro Focus executive Rohit De Souza (pictured above), MariaDB is already preparing for life as a private company once more — and this will involve getting cozier with the foundation that bears the same name. “The [MariaDB’s] Foundation’s reason for existing in times past was there was a lot of uncertainty about MariaDB’s future,” De Souza told TechCrunch in an interview. “Today, with the backing of K1, there isn’t that uncertainty anymore.” The initial MariaDB project launched in 2009 as a response to MySQL falling under certain corporate ownership. MySQL is the popular open source relational database management system created by Michael “Monty” Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson back in the mid-’90s, who sold the commercial company behind the project to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008. A year later, Oracle announced it was acquiring Sun Microsystems for more than $7 billion, spurring Widenius to create MariaDB as a community-developed “fork” of MySQL. In the wake of the deal, Widenius formed a couple of organizations, one called SkySQL (focused on MySQL services) and one called Monty Program (for MariaDB), which eventually merged and rebranded as MariaDB Corporation before going on to raise $230 million in funding to sell services around the MariaDB project. In tandem, the MariaDB Foundation (established in 2012) has been safeguarding the “interests of MariaDB users and developers” as an independent not-for-profit. Today, MariaDB is the 15th most popular database, according to DB-Engines Ranking, though that figure jumps to ninth for relational databases, and fourth for open source relational databases. There have been tensions between the two MariaDB bodies through the years, particularly around the corporate entity’s focus on building out proprietary products and tools — which MariaDB Foundation CEO Kaj Arnö suggested has been to the detriment of the open source project. But after MariaDB appointed a new CEO and executive team last May, relations thawed, Arnö noting at the time that the Plc and the Foundation were “rebooting their entire relationship” with shared goals centered around cooperation and openness. Twelve months on, and MariaDB has yet another new CEO. But an arguably more important factor is that it now has the backing of a major private equity firm, and it no longer has to pander to the pressures of the public markets. This could give MariaDB a little more freedom to get back to basics, in cahoots with the Foundation. “There’s like a billion downloads [MariaDB database] and a big, vibrant community. Our intent is to grow that community, and have the Foundation be the engine that helps that community grow,” De Souza said. “We’ve got fairly deep pockets [now] — that doesn’t mean that we’re going to go out and spend like sailors tomorrow, but we can run a decent business together. A closer involvement with the Foundation will help feed things that the community really needs into product development — it will help us understand the community, and we could also use the community more to test new ideas.” On the Foundation side, Arnö says that there are now “shared strategy sessions” taking place to find ways they can support each other’s efforts. He also echoed De Souza’s sentiments, adding that he doesn’t want to dwell too much on historical tensions. “The past is behind us — I want to focus on the future, and how we can all work together on a shared goal, and not elaborate on the past,” Arnö told TechCrunch. “I am now more optimistic about the relationship between the Foundation and MariaDB the Company than I have ever been since taking the CEO position in 2019.” Historically, the vast majority of the code for the core MariaDB Server product was provided by the MariaDB corporation, a reliance that led the Foundation to seek alternative sources. For example, last year it signed up Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its first “diamond” sponsor, which is committing €500,000 ($550,000) per year — more than any other sponsor. On top of that, the MariaDB Foundation is in the midst of bringing vector search (a major component of the AI revolution) to its main database, with Amazon one of the core contributors alongside the MariaDB corporation. While the “relationship reboot” between the two MariaDBs is surely positive for those in the community, the Foundation is continuing to lean into its relationship with Amazon, which is now one of the single biggest code-contributing corporations outside of MariaDB Plc. “AWS has recently stepped up to start contributing code for MariaDB Server,” Arnö said. “I find this to be exciting for a number of reasons, but in particular, of all the open source relational databases out there, AWS has specifically chosen to invest in MariaDB Server. MariaDB as part of AWS service offerings gives us great exposure to a large AWS user base, which feeds the overall community and collaboration we are trying to drive.” Today, MariaDB Plc claims around 200 employees, 40% of whom reside in North America, while nearly half are located in Europe. That’s somewhat fewer than what it had at the start of last year, with the company going through two rounds of layoffs amounting to more than 100 staff — one-third of the workforce. In addition, part of this restructuring has entailed ditching key products “not related to the core MariaDB Enterprise Server business,” including its SkySQL cloud database service. But despite all the cutbacks of the past 18 months, De Souza reckons that they’ll be more likely to see net growth in the coming months. “There are always going to be places that we’ve over-invested in or under-invested in. There’s always going to be some fine-tuning, but I expect MariaDB to grow — I do expect to infuse new talent,” De Souza said. “I do expect to augment the existing talent. There’ll be some areas where we have to change things. Obviously, it hasn’t worked in the past for a reason.” MariaDB grew off the back of more than $200 million in venture capital, and its failure in the public markets can be attributed to many things: the macroeconomic situation at the time, lukewarm financial performances, and the fact that it went public via the dubious SPAC route before it was close to profitable. Life as a private company, backed by private equity, couldn’t be more different — private equity is all about investing in underperforming businesses that have the potential to be stabilized and grow, and this usually starts with bringing in seasoned management. De Souza has a strong record in the enterprise realm, having previously worked at Intel, SAP, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, and most recently Micro Focus, where he was a senior executive through its $6 billion acquisition by OpenText. He was also previously CEO and president of data management company Actian, which was acquired by HCL and private equity firm Sumeru Equity Partners in 2018. And it’s this combination of experience and skills that De Souza sees as being one of the biggest assets that he brings to MariaDB. “It’s everything from helping navigate customers, helping drive how products are developed, how you actually build a sales team,” De Souza said. “Every one of those is required to build an enterprise software company. But really, it’s all about people: understanding the people that you need inside the company, and how you stabilize and build those teams.” While De Souza was hesitant to be drawn on the SPAC IPO debacle that his company endured before he joined, he did say that he was ultimately brought in to bring some “enterprise rigor” to the mix, now that it’s away from the pressures of being a public company. “You’ve got to run a company efficiently, and at a profit — it doesn’t take a genius to run a company at a loss,” De Souza said. “That’s part of why I’m here, it’s to bring some enterprise rigor to the business — how we develop products, what we invest in, how we create some consistency and focus around the communities.” Topics Meta lays off employees across multiple teams Apple reportedly worked with a Chinese automaker to develop a battery for its now-canceled car Y Combinator-backed fintech CapWay has shut down After selling Drift, ex-HubSpot exec launches AI for customer success managers Boston Dynamics teams with TRI to bring AI smarts to Atlas humanoid robot Mistral releases new AI models optimized for laptops and phones The woman who filmed Waymo’s honking robotaxis got an apology promo — then spent all day using it Senior Reporter © 2024 Yahoo.
