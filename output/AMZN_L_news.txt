Title: The Tech Job Meltdown

He wrote me a prescription; he said “You are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease”Industrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn’t the impact of COVID, this isn’t a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn’t (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like “it was overhiring during the pandemic” or “it’s a wave of H1B workers” or “all knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs” are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there’s a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of “qualified research and development spending” in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments… if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted “off the top” of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you’ve lived through unless you’re quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research… which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I’m about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I’m always doing that and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. But it’s not as broadly useful, and it’s not a simple recategorization, or we’d all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let’s assume they can’t reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically “tax credits”. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you’ll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little… unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the “real world” of companies focused on building tomorrow’s products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which … were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized “hey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!” And this new tax ruling doesn’t precisely say “we don’t want to do that” but it does say “we don’t want you to be quick about it” - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss “on paper” for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost… therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to “mandatory amortization”, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods… that’s one of them, as I’m sure you’ve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative “scoring”. The delay wasn’t legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - “grades” legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the “official” forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to “cheese the system” or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a “shock” when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced “extinction-level” tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they’re based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn’t anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don’t want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their “Year of Efficiency” in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don’t think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the “Magnificent Seven” are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That’s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms… heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads… built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I’ll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn’t write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn’t this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn’t going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was “cut expenses” and that mostly became “slow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees” so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what’s currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean “investing in R&D” and more generally “investing in software” for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the “tech sector”. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there’s a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we’re actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening “to defeat the Wealth Effect” and cool down speculative fervor … yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs.

It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

Δ The company is reorganizing Amazon Health Services into six units, CNBC reported Friday (June 13), citing its interview with Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services. “Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,” Lindsay told CNBC. “One of the problems we’re trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that’s common in healthcare.” Some of the new units will be headed by longtime Amazon leaders, while others will be led by executives from Amazon’s primary care chain, One Medical, according to the report. The changes do not include broad layoffs, the report said. The restructuring follows the departure of some health leaders in 2025, including the chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, the CEO of One Medical and the chief medical officer of Amazon, per the report. Lindsay said that the departures were part of the natural evolution of the business and that the organization has “no shortage of depth of talent,” according to the report. The six new divisions of Amazon Health Services include One Medical Clinical Care Delivery; One Medical Clinical Operations and Performance; AHS Strategic Growth and Network Development; AHS Store, Tech and Marketing; AHS Compliance; and AHS Pharmacy Services, per the report. Both Amazon and its rival Walmart are competing for not only retail dollars but also other infrastructure of daily living, including healthcare, media and cloud services, PYMNTS reported in May. The company has been expanding its healthcare offerings such as virtual care and chronic condition management by forming strategic partnerships with companies like Teladoc and mental health providers, PYMNTS reported in January. By integrating these services into its larger ecosystem, Amazon seeks to redefine healthcare access and challenge Walmart’s established position in the industry. In November, Amazon added new health and beauty-related services to its healthcare offering by extending the Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit telehealth service, which offers care on a range of different conditions and the option of on-demand messaging visits with clinicians.

Title: Job search going nowhere? Try this.

If you're trying to find a job, it's time to get scrappy. While the job market hasn't fallen off a cliff and layoffs remain low, stiffer competition for roles, surging use of artificial intelligence, and some employers' hesitation to hire are scrambling some job searches. That means some job seekers might have to pivot — potentially to an entirely new industry — or find other ways to stand out if they're set on a certain field. In some cases, you might have to adjust your goals. "Maybe put aside for the moment that dream to work for Amazon and Google, and maybe think about a different company that's more mid-cap," Angie Kamath, dean of the School of Professional Studies at New York University, told Business Insider. Kamath said the need to stay open to various options if you're looking for a role reflects the rapid change in many industries, especially as employers and employees alike try to understand what AI will mean for many aspects of work. "That's here to stay," she said, referring to the need for job seekers to understand how technology might remake jobs. To keep up, Kamath said, you should find ways to build your skills. That doesn't only mean getting a degree in a field, she said. Kamath said you might look to freebie or low-cost classes, for example, on AI from Amazon, Google, or online learning platforms like Udemy. "That's my No. 1 advice. Try something out. See if you like it. See if you hate it. See if you're energized by it," she said. If you don't want to shift to a different field or job type, you might simply have to work harder to stand out. Ryan McManus, a vice president at the recruitment firm Selby Jennings, told BI that some employers have become more selective in who they hire. "It might just be a bit more competitive in the sense that we're looking to check more boxes," he said, referring to finding candidates for the company's employer clients. For those who don't necessarily have every part of a job description nailed down, intangibles like being personable and a strong communicator can make a difference, McManus said. While finding ways to be flexible and try to stand out in a job search can help, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be easy to land a role. Some employers are slow-walking hiring, and some workers' confidence about business prospects is slipping. In the Glassdoor Employee Confidence Index released Tuesday, the share of employees who expect a positive six-month business outlook fell to 44.1% in May from 45.8% in April. The May reading was the lowest since 2016, when Glassdoor began collecting predictions from tens of thousands of US workers. To navigate an uncertain landscape, NYU's Kamath said job seekers might think of themselves as entrepreneurs who generate more than one idea for a business. "That's what we should do as we're looking for jobs. We should come up with a couple of versions of success, or what's interesting," she said. To know which option might be best, Kamath said it can help to ask friends what they think. She said that might mean having a conversation with a connection on LinkedIn who's in the line of work you're considering. Or it could involve visiting an employer that has public events or conferences. That manner of thinking, Kamath said, helps you avoid putting much pressure on yourself to land a certain role, and the thinking that "anything other than being successful in that one path equals failure." "It widens out what you might do and where you might do it," she said. Ultimately, Kamath said, job seekers often benefit when they step back and consider alternatives. "That's been very eye-opening for our students and our alumni to say there's more out there than the singular path to success," she said.

Title: Ticker: Data centers drive up power demand forecast; Jobless claims stick at 8-month high

U.S. data centers are rapidly driving up demand for power, with the official forecast for electricity consumption next year almost doubling in the past month. Total power usage in the U.S. is expected to climb 2.15% in 2026, spurred largely by a 5% spike from commercial users because of the expansion of data centers, according to a U.S. Energy Department report released this week. That’s up sharply from a month ago, when the agency expected commercial demand to rise by 2% and total consumption to gain by 1.12%. Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant. U.S. filings for jobless benefits were unchanged last week, remaining at the higher end of recent ranges as uncertainty over the impact of trade wars lingers. New applications for jobless benefits numbered 248,000 for the week ending June 7, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts had forecast 244,000 new applications. A week ago, there were 248,000 jobless claim applications, which was the most since early October and a sign that layoffs could be trending higher. “There are early warning signs in the labor market,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s chief economist, Heather Long. “If layoffs worsen this summer, it will heighten fears of a recession and consumer spending pullback.” On Wednesday, Google confirmed that it had offered buyouts to a swath of its workforce in a fresh round of cost-cutting ahead of a court decision that could order a breakup of its internet empire. Other companies that have announced job cuts this year include Procter & Gamble, Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft and Facebook parent company Meta.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change If you heard a distant wailing this week, don’t worry—it was just The New York Times realizing their beloved carbon capture techno-fantasy is, once again, face-planting in the real world. In a recent Climate Forward newsletter piece titled “Carbon Capture Comes Back Down to Earth”, Times writer David Gelles practically had to mop his keyboard with tears over the news that the carbon removal market—once projected to be a trillion-dollar juggernaut—is now wheezing toward irrelevance. Not that we mind. After all, here at Watts Up With That, we never bought into the carbon panic to begin with. CO2 isn’t a pollutant—it’s plant food. But watching the climate-industrial complex flop around trying to vacuum molecules out of the sky is pure entertainment. From “The Next Big Thing” to Layoff Bingo Just a few months ago, the hype machine was at full throttle. Bill Gates was investing. Google, Amazon, and Airbus were snapping up “carbon credits” like trendy NFTs. McKinsey—ever the oracle of bad ideas—declared carbon capture a $1.2 trillion market by 2050. One venture capitalist even called it “the single greatest opportunity I’ve seen in 20 years.” You almost have to admire the brazenness of the grift. Fast-forward to now: 24 government grants worth $3.7 billion have been scrapped, Climeworks axed 22% of its staff, and permit applications have tanked. The “market” is imploding because—brace yourself—no one wants to fund something that doesn’t work. Meanwhile, Climeworks’ headline-grabbing Iceland plant managed to remove only a sliver of its projected CO2. Naturally, the execs blame “ramp-up issues.” Of course they do. It’s never the technology’s fault—it’s always “early days” or “transitional challenges.” You’d think they were launching a moon mission, not running industrial shop vacs for the atmosphere. The Laws of Physics Want a Word Let’s be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show. Pulling CO2 from ambient air—where it exists at a wispy 0.04%—is like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach… using tweezers… while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place. And even then, you still have to compress it, transport it, inject it underground, and pray it doesn’t leak back out. This isn’t cutting-edge climate tech. It’s an energy-intensive Rube Goldberg machine designed to appease green investors, virtue-signaling corporations, and bureaucrats allergic to basic physics. Bonus: It Boosts Oil Production! Now here’s the kicker: the CO2 some of these companies do manage to capture is often used for enhanced oil recovery. That’s right—after spending billions to “fight climate change,” the carbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil. And yes, Occidental Petroleum—the same company running a giant DAC project in Texas—openly touts this as a feature, not a bug. The Times, ever reverent, quotes CEO Vicki Hollub promising that the project will help achieve “energy security” and “produce vital resources and fuels.” Translation: we’re going to burn more hydrocarbons and call it green. The NYT’s Tiny Violin Section What really makes this article sing is the melodramatic tone. The author laments layoffs, canceled subsidies, and a “retrenchment” in the industry like it’s some noble cause under siege. And when the DOE finally did something rational—canceling $3.7 billion in vaporware grants—the Carbon Capture Coalition, which is about as unbiased as a pharma lobby, called it a “major step backward.” For whom? Rent-seeking climatepreneurs? Even Climeworks now admits they’re going into “consolidation mode” and focusing on “efficiency.” Translation: the gravy train is slowing, so it’s time to pretend we’re tightening belts while keeping the PR spigot open. Final Thoughts: Not Our Problem Let’s be honest: the entire carbon capture craze was never about saving the planet. It was about: The NYT can whimper all it wants about Trump pulling the plug, but the real villain here is reality. Physics doesn’t care about good intentions, ESG scores, or narrative arcs. It just keeps tallying the kilowatt-hours. So while The Times continues wringing its hands over CO2 removal dreams deferred, we’ll be here pointing, laughing, and perhaps warming ourselves with the comforting glow of all that wasted taxpayer cash being vaporized in yet another doomed climate gimmick.

What do you think the O2 part of CO2 stands for? Be more curious, George Plant Trees and market them as Natural Carbon Capture Machines Please stop buying into their imaginary CO2 problem. There are lots of reasons why planting trees is a good idea, but capturing CO2 isn’t one of them. But it works. And gives us oxygen in return The oxygen is the important factor. Shade is nice. I like trees. Canada’s disgraced / dumped ex prime minister Justine Trudeau promised to plant 2 billion trees to save the planet. Turned out that all the spare land in Canada was already covered in trees, so nowhere left to plant another 2 billion of the buggers. That darn reality / rationality just keeps smacking ideology down. (Just as it always has) Somebody pointed out that some study said the permafrost line was moving northward 75 km per year causing CO2 and methane release…probable Climageddon. Someone else pointed out that they knew where the permafrost line was because the boreal forest was advancing northwards in unfrozen ground…someone else calculated how many trees must have sprouted to cover the area…Someone else calculated that Canada’s 300 billion trees only had to grow by 1.2 Kg of cellulose and lignin per year per tree to completely offset Canada’s entire anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Pretty soon the room went silent, and they changed the topic to how they could further greenwash getting more carbon taxes out of the oil and gas industry in Western Canada and rewarding their voter base in Ontario and Quebec for using electric heat pumps, and subsidizing electric cars. “Oh what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive” Sounds like some of our democrats have migrated up north. We have plenty of our own greenie weenies, thank you. Our new PM (Carney) is going to sell “decarbonized oil” to Asia. Forests are carbon (dioxide) neutral of course (trees die/burn/rot) It is really hard to come up with a worse idea than downgrading perfectly good electricity into hydrogen through electrolysis, but DAC and CCS (as “climate” mitigation) take the prize. This article is far too kind to CCUS schemes and purposes. There is NO good feature, period. Engineered and built a few AGI systems (acid gas injection) …if you are producing sour natural gas, containing H2S and CO2, sequestering it underground is very good solution in most cases compared to the expense of building and operating a sulfur plant. The earth is geologically active. How do you prevent leaks? Long term. Despite the hype, there is no real evidence that CO2 has any meaursable effect on our global climate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Spending money trying to fight climate change is just a big waste of funds. Climeworks Very close to Slimeworks, home of the famous Slimeburger, the ubiquitous ever miltipling fast food chain in the Craig Shaw Gardner’s Neatherhell novels. I think they knew all along. Every time I see the name, I think Crimeworks. Ha! In the enviro case Crimeworks does. It lines there pockets I just saw an article that exposed the Obama EPA’s refusal to introduce their study on carbon capture and storage because it concluded that process was not a viable technology. The policies implemented required a proven process to mitigate the “pollution” they controlled. This could be a story tip if I could find the article. Dilbert Dude, Scott Adams loves the idea of carbon capture. He’s proud of his economics training. What a tard. Nobody’s perfect. Doesn’t sound like him, either. Story tip. Consider my comments on carbon capture from a Wall Street Journal article below: Subject: Occidental Petroleum’s CO2 Reduction Plan In the April 11, 2023 edition of the Wall Street Journal, an article by Benoit Morenne described a plan by Occidental Petroleum to extract massive amounts of CO2 out of the air. Occidental is spending more than $1 billion to build the first of a planned fleet of plants. The plant will remove 500,000 metric tons of CO2 from the air per year. Occidental intends to build up to 135 more of these plants by the year 2035. Occidental claims that its initial cost to remove a metric tonne of CO2 would be between $400 and $500. Using $400 a metric ton, the total cost by 2035 would be $2,400,000,000, excluding possible cost reductions due to efficiencies of scale, for removing 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. Tax incentives will subsidize 45% of the initial costs, thanks to Bidens’ climate package that was signed into law last year. Consider how this plan will cut global CO2 levels from now to the year 2035. Assume that all 135 plants are on line and operating today. By 2035, these plants will have removed 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. The atmosphere weighs 5,500,000,000,000,000 (5.5 quadrillion) metric tons. 810,000,000 metric tons of removed CO2 is 0.0000147% of the atmosphere. CO2 currently constitutes about 0.04 % of the atmosphere. Removing 0.0000147 % of CO2 would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels to 0.03999%, which when rounded to two decimal places yields 0.04%. Ergo, there will be no significant percentage reduction in CO2 levels. Occidental expects to generate between $400 and $630 in revenue per metric ton, which includes a $180 per metric ton tax credit. So, even without the tax credits, Occidental expects to earn between $220 and $450 a metric ton. It should be noted that cost estimates for untested new technologies tend to escalate. Occidental’s projections of costs and potential revenues may be a bit too rosy in my opinion. Time will tell. At 2.4 billion dollars, Occidental’s project may or may not be a technical or financial success. But the anticipated removal of 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2035 from the atmosphere will not measurably change the global percentage of atmospheric CO2. I don’t know what the current price is but in 2022 the water plant I worked at paid $140.60 a ton for Liquid CO2. Unless the price has skyrocketed, $400 to $630 a metric ton doesn’t sound like a bargain. (Our supplier got the CO2 from ethanol production.) How does one generate a revenue from such a system without government funding? “Pulling CO2 from ambient air—where it exists at a wispy 0.04%—is like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach… using tweezers… while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.” Sounds thermodynamic. But as often, emphasis rather than quantitative. And wrong. The free energy difference between CO2 at 0.04% and 100% is RT*log(.0004)=8,3*290*log(.0004)=-18832 J/mol The heat of combustion of carbon is 393,500 J/mol. Are you talking about the heat of combustion of Carbon Dioxide molecules (CO2), or the heat of combustion of the Carbon (C) element here Nick? CO2 does not burn. It will burn with Fl2 or O3, won’t it? Yeah I get that – fire extinguishers. but why mention anything about Carbon when the subject is Carbon Dioxide? The claim was “It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.” OK, but the whole exercise was / is an idiotic pursuit in the first place, yes? And a flagrant waste of taxpayers’ dough. Nick, I think you win the battle but not the war. It does take less energy to sequester carbon than is produced by burning fossil fuels. But it takes so much energy, e.g., as a parasitical load in a coal-burning power plant, that sequestration becomes uneconomical. That is how I understood the article. Here in West Virginia AEP did a pilot CO2 sequestration project a decade or so ago and found it just won’t work. Actually, it did work. But the Virginia utility regulators refused to put their share of the costs into the rate base (AEP serves western Virginia). They also refused to pay the for the engineering study for the new 240 MW demonstration project (the pilot was 20 MW). So AEP shut down the project and wiped all of the pilot equipment off the site. What does the free energy difference have to do with extracting the molecules from the atmosphere? It’s the “basic physics” that this WUWT article says people are allergic to, but which WUWT doesn’t seem to have any idea about. So, instead of answering a legitimate question you chose to go with insults. Nick, Your argument will not convince anyone that plucking CO2 molecules from the atmosphere is a great idea. You might better spend your time planting trees. Meanwhile, I have some to cut** and dry for next year’s firewood. Just keeping up with their growth, dying, and decay is exhausting – – growth is relentless. **when I’m not planting little ones Just responding to “Let’s be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show.” It is Gelles who can’t get the thermodynamics right. Confusion there – it wasn’t Gelles (NYT), it was the WUWT writer. Your figures seem to assume that the removal process is 100% efficient. What is the actual energy consumption involved in the process? You are correct, Nick. 18.8 kJ/mol is much less than 393,500 J/mol. Billions have been invested wasted in technologies schemes to remove carbon dioxide from the sky in recent years. But Trump’s policies have clouded the outlook ended the farce. There, I fixed it. Very nice, more good news. If CO2 is removed from the air, CO2 will bubble out of all bodies of water, especially the cold polar oceans, to replace the captured CO2 molecules. What were the OXY chemical engineers thinking? Remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all other factors being equal, the oceans and earth will emit CO2 to replace it to maintain equilibrium of the partial pressure. Shoveling against the tide. Comedy is the wrong word. Tragedy is more appropriate. Direct Air Capture vs. a Leaf: Guess Which One Works Better This a loaded question. One works and one doesn’t. To my knowledge, no one has developed technology that has captured more carbon than was released in making the facility to capture the carbon. It is the same thing with wind turbines and solar panels. They do no more than shift the location where the carbon gets burnt. They do not reduce it. HOW? How could anybody be so stupid as to think such a scheme could work? How? Stupid? Maybe. Greedy? Definitely. Correction: “carbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil” No. CO2 is injected. The Iceland plant did not extract even one gram of molecular carbon. It did manage a pissant amount of CO2. MIT researchers a while back came up with a very interesting process. Similar to photosynthesis, they passed are over a chemical element and in the presence of sunlight produced methane. I lost the link. Typo: they passed CO2 over a chemical element…. All of this nonsense is no different than Solyndra. It’s an unsophisticated money laundering operation where left wing politicians use taxpayer money to fund obviously non-viable projects coincidentally run by their friends. Eventually all the taxpayer money vanishes into the pockets of the politicians and their friends. There is no accountability or oversight, just a bunch of truly terrible people getting rich off the taxpayers. How much CO2 “needs” to be captured for “carbon capture” to work? What will be done with it? How much space will all that CO2 take up? Where will it be put? Some of this may have been addressed in posts I’ve missed, but they’re questions I’ve had for a while about this approach. Leaving aside whether it’s actually needed, it seems quite impractical to do at any scale that would make a difference globally. I lived in Iceland where the pictured scrubbers are. I find this very odd. They have geothermal heat everywhere. The Blue Lagoon is a tourist attraction driven by geothermal heat. If the scrubbers aren’t next to a volcano they are useless. I was lucky enough to visit Hekla when it erupted in the early 70’s. An awesome sight. There are lots of volcanoes that spew lots of CO2 in Iceland.

AI.gov site was discovered by researchers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. An apparently leaked GitHub page has revealed the Trump administration is working on a website called ai.gov, set to launch on July 4 with the aim of trying to, “accelerate government innovation with AI” The site was uncovered by 404Media researchers after an early version of the website was posted on GitHub by the General Services Administration (GSA), The Register reports. Now taken down, the page was aimed at serving as a hub for government agencies to enable AI integration into their processes. The GSA department responsible for the website looks to be the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). Headed up by Thomas Shedd, a close associate of Elon Musk, the TTS will seemingly launch the AI website with three key components; a chatbot, an “all-in-one” API that enables connections between existing systems and AI models from Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI, and ‘CONSOLE’ - a "groundbreaking tool to analyze agency-wide implementation," according to the page. The initial staging site suggests that the ai.gov site will serve AI models through Amazon Bedrock, and most of the models listed in the API documentation on the GitHub page are FedRAMP certified for government usage, the researchers confirmed. However, they note that one model identified and listed from AI firm Cohere is not FedRamp certified. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The fact the US government is planning to leverage AI or increase its connections with AI companies probably won’t come as much of a surprise to anyone - with the Trump administration pushing hard for widespread government adoption. Earlier in 2025 it was announced that the IRS could use AI to replace fired workers following mass layoffs at the hands of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Other departments like the SEC and VA are reportedly bracing for ‘restructuring’ as the department investigated whether AI can be used to replace human workers across a range of government departments.

I’m HBR executive editor Alison Beard filling in for Hannah Bates. This month, we’re highlighting some of the best conversations from the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit held in April. In today’s episode, we hear from David Risher, the CEO of Lyft. Since taking the wheel in 2023, figuratively and literally, Risher has led the company through a bold transformation—focusing on customer obsession, technological innovation, and a renewed commitment to drivers and riders alike. Lyft recently reached record bookings and a 31% increase in annual revenue and its first full year of profitability. In this conversation with me, Risher shares how his own experience behind the wheel as a Lyft driver informs product innovation. And why listening deeply—whether to a single passenger or a room of drivers—can lead to breakthrough ideas. He also opens up about navigating layoffs, launching inclusive features, and preparing for an autonomous future while keeping human dignity front and center. If you care about service, leadership, or what it takes to revive a brand in a hyper-competitive space, this episode is for you. Here it is. ALISON BEARD: I want to hear how Lyft evaluates and anticipates what customers want and need. Is it analytic surveys, focus groups, all of the above? DAVID RISHER: It’s kind of all of the above, but in maybe a different order. So I would actually say analytics are the least important, and I’m going to tell you why in a second. The most important, for sure, is lived experience. So we’re really lucky. Lyft gives two million rides a day, obviously a huge volume, 800 million rides a year. And every one of us– we have 3,000 people who work for us. Every one of us can be a rider or a driver. And I actually am a huge, huge believer in lived experiences, one of the best ways to– because then you’re literally putting yourself in the driver’s seat or in the passenger seat. You don’t even have to imagine it. We also do round tables pretty often with drivers in particular where we’ll bring groups of drivers together. I’ve done them in New York. I’ve done them in DC, in Boston, in Seattle, here in San Francisco because people’s interests vary a little bit in different parts of the country, so for sure. Social media is also really important. Of course, you have to filter things out a little bit, but there is a lot of wisdom out there if you can see through the noise and through some of the frustration and extreme stuff that you get. I get email every day and texts all the time from friends and from random people who find my email address online. And so it’s all that. And then analytics is– the reason I say it’s the least important is because it’s so tempting, I think, to sit at your desk and look at the numbers. And while you can use that to size opportunities and maybe prioritize, but you very rarely get the real insight that leads to the breakthrough just by looking at the analytics. ALISON BEARD: I know that you’ve done some Lyft-driving yourself, so is that standard process for all managers so you can better understand the situation on the ground? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, I’d like to say that it is. This sounds maybe a little braggy, but I think I’ve driven more than– I think this is true– than just about anyone else at the company. So we have 1.5 million drivers on the platform. They’re all independent contractors. But in terms of Lyft employees, I might be the first. I’m not sure. I drive about every six weeks, and I never tell people when I’m going to do it. I don’t tell the social media team or anything like that. I do post about it afterwards just with the pictures and experiences I’ve had, and you can see that on LinkedIn. But I take it really seriously, really seriously. And I listen very carefully. I ask, tell me why you chose Lyft today, and also very interested in other things going on in people’s lives. I’ve had these great conversations with people who, for example– I’ll give you an example. So I picked a woman– I live in San Francisco. I picked a woman up– this was last year– in Sausalito. And I said, why did you choose Lyft? And she said, well, look, every day I wake up in the morning at, like, 6 or 7 o’clock in the morning. And I said, why? And she said, well, to check the pricing because sometimes it’s $20. Sometimes it’s $30. Sometimes it’s $40. And it kind of drives me crazy because when it’s $40, that’s too expensive for me, but when it’s $20, I’ll take it. $30, maybe I’ll check the competition. But today is a colleague’s birthday, and so I really wanted to be there. So I was so glad that it was inexpensive. So just that conversation really got me understanding how frustrating what’s called surge pricing is to people. And I can tell you all about this, but we have a feature called Price Lock that really tries to get rid of it. And it was really developed or it was catalyzed because of that conversation I had with her. ALISON BEARD: So when you get these new ideas for features or services, how do you make a decision about which will be worthwhile and value-creating to pursue? And then how quickly can you move to execution? DAVID RISHER: So two very different questions. The answer to the second is it’s never quickly enough, so this is a source of constant– it turns out, as a CEO, you can have all sorts of ideas about how fast things can go, and then just brutal reality gets in your way. I’ll come back to that in a second. The prioritization is– so we have a pretty rigorous process because, again, of course, there are always more ideas than you can possibly do. And so broadly, broadly speaking, we’re always– OK, Lyft’s business model, very simply, is the more people we have taking rides, the better we do. It’s kind of that simple. If our fixed costs are more or less fixed, which they are, then the incremental contribution of every ride– it might be $1, or it might be $2, might be $3, whatever it is– is a certain number. And the more of those we can drive across the platform, the more money we make. We’re now profitable, as you said in your introduction. We spun off about $760 million in cash over the last 12 months. That was up from negative $300 million the year before. So once you really understand the basics of the business model, everything else is just execution. And so that helps you understand then how you evaluate new ideas is, can it– is the product market fit– is the potential for product market fit so good that it could potentially drive hundreds of thousands or millions of more rides on the platform? Now, the economics of them might be different. So for example, with Price Lock, it’s actually a subscription product. You pay $2.99 a month, and then you lock in a price, a cheap price so it doesn’t bounce around. And then we have to do a lot of math to try to figure out whether we can make money on that or not. So you then have to figure out whether you can do it profitably. But the first question is, is it compelling? Is it interesting? Can it touch either, I’ll say– let’s call it millions of people. Or is it something that maybe a smaller group of people care about, but they care about it so much that the impact is outsized? And I think those are two different cases, but they both come up. And I’ll give you just very quickly an example of the latter. This actually came out of another– I mentioned this idea of driver roundtables. We were talking to about 12 different people. This is in New York City. And we were talking about things that they like about the platform and things they don’t, and one of the women said almost offhand– she said, you know, I have a tough time taking breaks to go to the bathroom. And I said, why? And she said, well, some bathrooms– they feel unsafe, or they’re dirty, or whatever. And then she said, the thing that struck with me– that stuck with me the most. She said, and I can’t just pull out a bottle and pee in it. It’s like, OK, that’s a good point. And so we developed as a result of that and some other things we’re doing something called a restroom finder now that allows drivers to indicate where there are safe restrooms and easy-to-access restrooms and maybe what the restroom code is. So anyway, so it might only affect a– it affects all drivers at some point, but it probably only affects a small number of drivers in a deep way. But for those drivers, it’s really important. ALISON BEARD: I love that example because it illustrates how you have customers that are riders, but then your drivers are also your customers. So you have to be equally obsessed with their experience. DAVID RISHER: That’s right. ALISON BEARD: So talk about that execution piece. And sorry for jamming two questions together, but when you decide that that’s a great thing to implement, the restroom finder, how do you ensure that your teams can get it out there quickly enough that it makes an impact? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it’s such a– it’s a simple question, and there are multitudes within it because of course you have an annual plan that you’ve done. You have certain themes you really want to work through over the course of the year. So as an example, one of the themes we’ve been working on for quite a long time is, how can we increase driver earnings? How can we increase driver earnings? As you say, there are two customers in every car. The rider has a certain price that they’re willing to pay. The driver has a certain price that they’re willing to accept. And we have to figure out how to make those lines cross millions of times every single day. Drivers get very frustrated if they feel that they’re not getting rides that meet a certain threshold for them. In some cases, there’s work we can do at the user interface level to help a driver see how much they’re going to make. This is something we’ve done a lot of work on to make it very clear every time they accept a ride how much money they can expect to make on that on a per-hour basis so it’s easy for them to compare. But we’ve also put in minimum standards. So we used to have no minimum. Now we have a 70% earnings guarantee. That means that at the end of every week a rider will always get– excuse me, a driver will always get at least 70% of what riders pay after insurance and some other fees are taken out. And that’s been a game-changer, very expensive– it costs us millions of dollars to do– very technically complex. And so it took us months and months of work to do. This was last year. But because it fit in a thematic piece that we’d already put out for ourselves over the year, how can we increase driver earnings, we had space for it. So it was a lot of work, but it was kind of straightforward. The trickier ones are ideas that come along the way that you hadn’t necessarily anticipated, or you realize, we’re kind of missing the boat here, or whatever it is. And then, frankly, it’s a lot of my job as CEO– you think of it as an allocation question. Like, how do I reallocate resources periodically in a way that focuses on a combination of what we thought was important at the beginning of the year and what we think is important now without being so disruptive? I know that’s of a generic answer, but it’s the way it goes. ALISON BEARD: No, I think that’s useful. So I’m on the same note, when you discover that there are problems, how do you fix them? I hear you have something called Falcon Mode. DAVID RISHER: I do. [CHUCKLES] I do. I do. Yeah, I do. So Falcon Mode refers to the idea that– so Falcons are unbelievable animals. And I’m not a falconer, by the way. I don’t know that much about them. But what I do know is that they can fly at very, very high altitude for a very long period of time. But then they get hungry, and so they’ve got to dive. And they got to dive 2,000 feet or whatever it is and then pick a fish out of the ocean or whatever it is they actually eat. As I say, I’m not really a falconer. So as a metaphor, I use it sometimes to help people understand, there are going to be times where even I at the level that I operate need to go deep, and I need to go deep fast. I need to understand some problem at some level of detail so that I’m assured myself that I’m making good calls on whether or not to put energy over here or energy over here or what have you. Now, the problem, of course, is that generally people who work for you don’t like this very much. [CHUCKLES] And there’s this word, “micromanagement,” that comes up from time to time. I don’t think I’m that person, but maybe some people have a different opinion. But my point is I’m not trying to solve necessarily the problem. That’s generally not my job. But I do believe that sometimes you have to go very deep to understand the problem and to hang out in that problem space for a while and really get it. So let’s go back to driver earnings for a second. It’s very easy to detect that drivers want to be paid more like anyone who’s doing a job. That’s not complicated. The question becomes then, how do you do it in an economic way? But I think what becomes more interesting is, well, hold on. What else are drivers telling us about their goals and their life besides the obvious, besides the loud thing, which is earnings? And one of the things that we know is that– so the vast majority of people who drive on the Lyft platform do it part time. They’ll do it 20 hours a week or less. Often it’s supplemental income. Sometimes it’s a bridge. They’ve just lost their job, and they need to earn quick money, whatever it is. But it’s always– most of the time– let’s call this 85% of the time– it’s part of a bigger plan. Call it 15% of the time a person might want to be a professional driver. 85% it’s a bigger plan. So how can we support them? How can we– how can we support them in a way that’s going to be economically good for us? So we put together this thing called the driver accomplishment letter, which allows the driver to push a button and get a readout of their accomplishments, an AI-generated readout so they can use that, for example, as a reference letter for another service-oriented job. That’s an example– sorry for going on at some length with this, but that’s an example of moving beyond the transactional and the obvious stuff and trying to understand deeply enough, what do drivers really care about? Not just making more money but setting themselves up for maybe longer-term financial success in a way that if you don’t do those social media readings or focus-groupy-type things– you might not get to. But once you get there, you realize, oh, yeah, this really matters too. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. So in your recent shareholder letter, you recently wrote about a different kind of problem. You have a term for it that I’ll let you share yourself. But it’s basically the slow degradation of a product, of a service that happens over such a long period of time that you’re not really aware of it, until the problem is so bad that it’s more difficult to fix. So how do you protect against that? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so I think you’re referring to enshittification. I appreciate your– [CHUCKLES] I understand. I wrote this letter myself, but of course I have other people who look at it. And I got a lot of– some pushback on the term. But I said, look, this is it’s first of all, it’s not mine. It’s Cory Doctorow’s term. You might know him. He’s an author and a thinker. And one of the things that he recognized some period of time ago is that ideas and businesses, let’s say– they start often with a high-quality, high-bar mode but then over time tend to get worse. And you can see this even within rideshare. Rideshare, for those of you who’ve been paying attention for, let’s say, the last decade– you might remember when you first got in the car it was kind of a magical experience. The driver treated you super well, and maybe it was a very nice car. And it kind of felt amazing. I push a button, and three minutes later, someone pulls up. They take me where I want to go. I don’t have to pay at the end. It seems like magic, all this stuff. Well, rideshare, like many other things– but I’ll use the industry I know the best. I would say, looking at it objectively, it’s gotten worse over time, not better. And we’re in the service industry. That’s crazy. So one of the, let’s say, responsibilities I feel, as a leader in this industry, is to push against that and to say, let’s not just let that be the way. Let’s not let quarterly earnings or what I call additive bias– again, not my term. But there’s always a general mode of, just add more and more stuff to a thing, and make it better, which sometimes is exactly the wrong thing to do. Anyway, let’s actively fight against some of this. And again– I should zoom out– my basic premise in the last two years has been– customer obsession is what’s going to drive profitable growth. Customer obsession will drive profitable growth. And it’s worked right. We used to be not profitable. Now we’re profitable, full stop. And we used to be not growing so much, and now we’re growing a lot. So anyway, so I think all the questions you’re asking get at the same fundamental premise, which is, can you really be a customer-obsessed organization and grow as a result profitably? And we’re trying to demonstrate the answer is yes. ALISON BEARD: So on that note, Shazab is asking, how do you ensure that your 1.5 million driver contractors, who are gig workers– they’re not employed by Lyft– live and embrace your customer experience obsession? DAVID RISHER: Ah, this is a very cool question. This is a very cool question. And I’m going to answer the question, but I’m going to give you– I’m going to tell you you’re in good company for asking this question. So first of all, let me say this– service, of course, doesn’t just mean, what happens when you’re in the car. It means, for example, after I open up the app, what’s the estimate I’m going to get? How fast am I going to get picked up? Let’s start with that. So right now we pick you up about a minute faster, on average, than we did a year ago. That’s about 40 faster than our biggest competitor, which is actually quite an accomplishment. So before I get to the answer, I will just note that “service” means a whole lot of different things. It can mean, for example, does your driver cancel on you, which is quite irritating? And you might– interestingly enough, it’s actually hard to detect in the data how irritating it is because people tend to get rematched, and a car eventually picks them up. But people find it very frustrating. They don’t like the idea of– and you’ve probably seen this yourself. It says, oh, we’re finding a new ride. It’s not a great experience. So anyway, that service experience starts from the second you pick up the app. But now to the center of your question, now you get in the car. The car pulls up, and you get in the car. And I find this a very, very interesting question of how can– we do all kinds of things today. Let’s just start with level set. So we have what’s called a driver education center, a coaching center. I’m a driver myself, as I said. I just got a prompt yesterday to go in and review some videos and stuff. In a week– actually, we haven’t said this publicly yet, but I’ll say it now because why not– we’re actually starting a new driver podcast, which I think will be very cool because drivers, of course, spend time in the car. And it’s actually not– it’s produced by Lyft, but it’s actually drivers talking to– its two drivers, a man and a woman, talking to each other about how to deliver great service and how that connects to great tips. So that’s cool. And then we also have various incentive programs and bonuses and so forth and so on if you do certain things and don’t do certain things. So there’s a whole, as you can imagine, machine behind it. But I still think the question is even more interesting because– and I’ve asked this very same question. I happen to have had the very lucky experience of getting to talk to Thomas Keller a couple months ago, who runs The French Laundry and then just completely coincidentally to Eric Ripert, who runs Le Bernardin in New York, so two three-star Michelin restaurants. And I asked both of them exactly the question you’re asking me. I said, how can we, as a company, coach, cajole, encourage, whatever it is but create a service culture, a service ethic among the 1.5 million drivers that drive on our platform that’s at the same level, same consistency, maybe not five-star, three-star level but a consistent level, that you do in your restaurants? And both of them– it was so interesting. You know the difference in a question you ask, and the person is– they give you a rote answer and like, whatever. But this was the opposite. In both cases, they leaned into this and spent another five or 10 minutes saying, that’s a mind-blowing, mind-blowing idea. Like, how can you get at that level the type of service that we get? So that was a very, very long way of not answering a question. I don’t actually know yet. I can tell you some of the things we’re working on, and some of them I’ve already mentioned. But I think it’s one of the things that’s going to, I hope, set us apart and make us an industry leader in this group, in this area. ALISON BEARD: I’m sure that driver experience, customer experience is going to play a big role in your answer to the next question. But it is a really good one, and it’s certainly one on everyone’s mind. Two people are asking it. Jordan asks, how does Lyft differentiate itself from its biggest competitor to encourage consumers to switch? And an anonymous viewer asks, how did you position your company to compete so well against a robust, name-recognized competitor? And kudos to our very polite audience for not mentioning the name of the competitor. But that’s the question for you. How are you battling this dominant force in your industry? DAVID RISHER: Sure. So again, it is a good question, and it’s quite hard. It’s quite hard, particularly when some of our drivers drive on both platforms. The car is the same. So it’s quite an interesting problem. I’ll go back to the same thesis. So you mentioned also that I was on the board of Lyft for a couple of years before joining the CEO. And it’s quite interesting and, of course, a separate issue of the perception you have of as a company– of a company as a board member versus inside. I will say, as a board member, I believed the company was customer-obsessed, and I was asked to be on the board to push that idea at the board level because boards often think about finance and strategy, not so much customers. But I came to believe over the course of the two years I was on the board before joining as CEO that customers– and then when I joined the company as CEO, I realized, no. Not that we were not but that, gosh, we were a bunch of different things. We were many– we were trying to do too many things all at the same time and maybe not– not maybe not. I’m sorry– definitively not really obsessing over our customers. We were pricing too high. We were paying too little. Our reliability wasn’t so great, on and on and on. And so the answer to your question– again, it comes to the same. Our purpose is to serve and connect. Let me start with those two words, “serve” and “connect.” And I want to serve riders and drivers better than they’ve ever been served before, and I want to connect them with the people and places they love. That’s big, big picture, what I want to do. And that’s what we’re doing. So I’ll give you some evidence that we’re beginning to make some inroads against those other guys. When I joined– let’s look at two statistics. When I joined, our share was about a 26, maybe 27, now, most recent, about a 30, 31. That might not seem like a big change, but it’s a big change. In Canada, we’ve gone from being irrelevant to having our ride volume double and double again. That’s been 100% a street fight against the other guys because we weren’t really there, and then we entered seriously about a year ago. And now we’ve been– And again, so some of it comes from differentiated service, things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, a product I started, actually, on the first day I was here that lets women drivers and riders choose each other, a product that’s coming out next week. I’ll give you an early preview. It’s called Lyft Silver, which allows old people to have a simplified version of the app, and you can invite them to be part of the app and even pay for their ride if you’re maybe a son or daughter, caregiver. So some of it’s product differentiation. Some of it’s partnerships. We have partnerships with a company called Bilt, for example, or a company called, well, Chase Sapphire Reserve. Many people probably have their credit card or– in the audience. So some of it’s that. We have these sorts of partnerships that give us exclusive or preferential access to certain customer sets in return for certain things. Some of it’s brand, an area, actually, we haven’t actually invested that much in recently, but you’ll see more of that later this year and next year. So again, maybe a little bit of an “all of the above” thing, but the through line through all this is we want to level up the service that you get by far, by far and really redefine it. And here’s where I’ll end. On the driver’s side– and this is probably the area where we’ve made the most progress– because of things like earnings guarantee, because of– and this earnings commitment and a set of tools around that and various other things we’ve done, we now have a 20-point advantage, 20-point advantage over the other guys when drivers are asked the question, which company would you prefer to drive from, 20 points. So step by step by step, by treating them well, by obsessing over drivers and riders, that’s how we’re getting there. ALISON BEARD: So you’ve been a change agent in the company. When you took over as CEO, you wanted to execute a turnaround that included layoffs at the start. How did you make the very difficult decisions in that scenario and then communicate them to the workforce? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it was very difficult but in a weird way kind of straightforward. And this is what I mean. So my first day was April 17, 2023, and I had actually been coming in for the prior– call it two months, on Thursdays and Fridays. So that my first full-time day. And within the first, say, six weeks, we had announced a couple of very significant things. The first, as you mentioned, was quite a significant layoff. It was 26% of the workforce. Now, that’s devastating. That’s devastating. But– or and, I guess I should say– the framing that I gave was, this is the only way, only way that I know how to pay for the things that we are going to do for our customers, for our riders and drivers, which is to say, lower prices to be competitive and raise pay to be competitive. And I was– and of course it was devastating, of course, for the company and particularly because the company had gone through layoffs in the past. But I will say– and I don’t think this is just people telling me what they thought I wanted to hear– even some people who left the company, who were asked to leave the company or told to leave the company, said, I hate it, but I get it. But I get it. If we want this company to survive, you got to make these types of choices, and it’s the type of choice that maybe we needed to have made in the past that we didn’t make with such clarity of purpose, which was so that we could provide better service to riders and drivers. The second thing, just to walk down that path for a couple more steps, I said is– and remember, you have to put yourself back in 2023. We’re all coming back to work three days a week. Now, this was an interesting decision because at the time it was not obvious that that was maybe the right thing to do. And in fact, the company had in the past said, we’re going to be remote first, as many companies did. Now, obviously, a lot of companies since have also done the same. But I bring this up because I thought of it as a very important cultural moment for us as well, to say, if our purpose is to serve and connect and we’re about getting people out of the house and dealing– all these sorts of things, we can’t just do it remotely, and we’re not going to come up with our best ideas. And we’re not going to– it’s very hard for that– again, you can look at the data screens. But to get that real feel of what drivers and riders really will respond to without the whiteboard sessions and all the rest, so that was a very important second thing. And then the third thing that we announced– it was all right in these first couple of weeks– was a new product called Women+ Connect. This– I mentioned this before briefly– allows women riders and drivers to choose each other. And this was something I actually started on the first day. It was actually 10 o’clock in the morning the first day I was here. And the reason I thought it was so important is because it was an idea that had been kind of floating around for a while, and people had always come up with a way to say no to it. Ah, it’s complicated, or there’s legal issues, or this or that, all sorts of things. And I’m like, yeah, but on the other hand, 25%– excuse me, 50% of our riders are women, roughly, and 25% of our drivers are women. And they’re telling us guys, when we listen, that they’re not always comfortable, particularly late at night or particularly in a new city. They’re not always comfortable. So what are we doing here? So anyway, we pushed through some of those objections and talked about the risks and characterized them in certain ways and did the technical work. And I think it was six months later, in August, they came out with a– came out with the product. And it’s been very popular. It’s actually one of our most popular products, particularly for drivers. Once they turn it on, they never turn it off I go into detail on this because I wanted to say from the beginning, it’s not just about cost-cutting. It’s cost-cutting for a reason– we can do better for riders and drivers as a result. And we’re going to grow too. We’re going to innovate. We’re not going to let this stall us, and we’re going to do it together. ALISON BEARD: That’s good advice for anyone who’s trying to lead a change effort in any-size organization or team. So Martin asked, would you consider onboarding autonomous drivers, i.e., cars without driver, and Wendy asks, how does Lyft view the Waymo disruption, continuing to innovate toward that future trend, while balancing your current business model and offering and assuring support to your current drivers? [00:28:23.75] DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so great questions. So the answer to the first is yes, we will absolutely welcome autonomous vehicles onto our platform. In fact, we’ve already announced an agreement with a company called– with a company called May Mobility that operates or will operate in Atlanta later this year, actually this summer. They operate Toyota Siennas in self-driving mode. And we’ve announced an agreement with Mobileye, which is a technology company that produces autonomous technology that will be installed in a to-be-named OEM, to-be-named car that will also be on our platform. And I think, if I zoom out for just one click, autonomous vehicles, self-driving vehicles are absolutely going to happen. In some places, it’ll happen fast. Here in San Francisco, they’re happening quite quickly. In other places, it’ll be slower. But it’s going to happen. So then the question is, well, how do you really embrace it? How do you bring them onto your platform in a way that hopefully expands the market, which– we’ve actually seen some evidence of that, which is great– is respectful and acknowledges the fact that you’ve got millions of people driving on the platform too? So how do you work with them through this transition period? And then how do you make sure that you’re not accidentally being disrupted out of business? Waymo is a very interesting company. Perhaps at some point they’ll be a partner of ours. Right now you might see them as a competitor, a small-scale competitor. But still, they’re doing stuff that competes directly with us in some of our markets. So it’s no exaggeration to say it’s probably the thing that I’m thinking about the most and our board is the most engaged with, but I’m quite optimistic that under 99 scenarios out of 100 it turns out to be actually quite accretive for the industry because it gets– remember, people take 160 billion rides a year in their own private cars. Rideshare is only three billion between us and the other guys. So there’s so much opportunity for other people driving you and that experience being part of people’s lives that I tend to be much more focused on how to take advantage of that market share expansion than I am about fighting a particular battle with a particular competitor or something like that. ALISON BEARD: OK. This is another anonymous viewer asking. He’s clearly done his research. He says, from your wiki page, an impressive career advancement, Microsoft, Amazon, and now Lyft. It’s clear that your bosses have loved you. What characteristics do you think set you apart from others? DAVID RISHER: Wow. That’s like a– it’s like an Oprah Winfrey-style question. ALISON BEARD: I know. I love it when they get personal. I do love it when they get personal. DAVID RISHER: Honestly, it’s maybe easier for me to turn the question around just a little bit and say what I learned at those places. What I learned from working at Microsoft– and I didn’t work directly for Bill Gates, of course, but I did have enough interaction with him to get a sense of who he was and what his values and focus was. He was a very competitive person, and so I learned how to compete hard. I really did. And that was very important learning. And then I also learned a lot about taking technology, from a guy named Todd Nelson, actually, my boss for a long time at Microsoft, taking technology which can feel a little obscure, particularly back in the ’90s, and making it personal and trying to understand it at a personal level, not just at a technology level. I think I did work directly for Jeff Bezos for quite a long time at Amazon, and customer obsession really did come from him. He understood early on the internet everyone’s a click away from everyone else, and so if you don’t– there’s no such thing as an undifferentiated competition. You have to differentiate in order to compete. Otherwise, people go to something else that’s better, so anyway, that real focus on customer obsession. And then I ran Worldreader for a long time, the nonprofit I founded, and there I was my own boss. I was my– well, my board was boss. But really what I learned there is this idea of leading with purpose and that you can get people– you have so few tools in the nonprofit world. You have small salaries. You don’t have stock. But you do have purpose, and if you lead with purpose, gosh, people are willing to do amazing things. So maybe those are some things I’ve learned over the years. ALISON BEARD: I really like that you turned a question asking about why you’re so amazing to talk about why your bosses were so amazing and what they taught you. And so I think maybe what characteristic is most salient for you is that you’re a learner. You’re curious, and you’re picking up lessons from other people. OK, this last question– and it’s just a one-word answer– what’s your Lyft driver rating? DAVID RISHER: 5. [CHUCKLES] ALISON BEARD: I’m not surprised. All right, David, I’m sorry that we’re out of time. It’s really been a pleasure talking with you today. Thank you so much. DAVID RISHER: Alison, I’ve had a ton of fun. Thanks for the great questions from you and from the whole audience. It was great. ALISON BEARD: That was Lyft CEO David Risher in conversation with me at the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit.

Title: Despite $2M salaries, Meta can't keep AI staff — talent flocks to rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic

I think we're in the wrong industry. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As companies pour billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, demand for AI talent to program and run these AI data centers is also greatly increasing. Deedy Das, a Venture Capitalist at Menlo Ventures and a former Google Search staff member, posted on X that Meta has an over $2 million annual pay package for AI talent, but still keeps losing its people to OpenAI and Anthropic. He said that he’s personally heard three such cases this week alone, which is major news given the size of Meta’s compensation. Statistics say that for every 10.6 from DeepMind, 8.2 from OpenAI, and 2 from Hugging Face that move to Anthropic, it only loses one employee for each company. This movement shows that the startup is quickly growing and that many people from competing AI labs want to work for it. We don’t know how much the company offers, though, but we can safely assume that it’s at least on par or, more likely, substantially larger than what the competition pays. According to the SignalFire research, beyond salary, Anthropic's edge is a unique culture that embraces "unconventional thinkers" and gives employees true autonomy, as well as flexible work options, a lack of title politics and forced management tracks. Furthermore, employees report an embrace of intellectual discourse and researcher autonomy, compared to bureaucracy elsewhere. Meta is currently offering $2M+/yr in offers for AI talent and still losing them to OpenAI and Anthropic. Heard ~3 such cases this week.The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous.Today, Anthropic has the highest ~80% retention 2 years in and is the #1 (large) company top AI… pic.twitter.com/YSv5UNV5H2June 10, 2025 Aside from this, Das also mentioned that Anthropic has an unusually high two-year employee retention rate. The tech industry average is around 40% to 50%, with the retention rate dropping over the past couple of years due to layoffs. However, many AI startups’ two-year retention rates vary between 63% and 80%, with Anthropic holding the top spot. Next to it is Google’s DeepMind, which has a retention rate of 78%. Many new employees who work in AI labs also come from major tech giants. It’s estimated that 5.4% of new hires come from Google’s non-AI divisions, while 4.3% are former Meta staffers. A further 3.2% used to work with Microsoft, and another 2.7% are ex-Amazon employees, while 2.1% were previously affiliated with Stripe, and 1.7% came from Apple. This accounts for nearly 20% of new employees in AI labs that have come from tech giants. Massive tech companies used to be the dream job for many people, especially as they offered competitive pay, strong career growth, many opportunities within the industry, and prestige. However, 2024 was a bad year for the tech sector, with many companies laying off thousands of people. Intel was one of the biggest losers, with the company laying off 15% of its workforce (roughly 15,000 employees) after its disastrous August 2024 financial report. However, other companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Dell, and AMD were also hit with workforce reductions. On the other hand, the continued growth in the AI sector is pushing many talented individuals towards these startups, as shown by the data. This will likely continue in the near future, as companies and nations continuously build more and more AI data centers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond Competing lawsuits between Ad Populum and Alliance Entertainment reveal the Diamond Comics Distributors bankruptcy timeline began last July With Alliance Entertainment (AED) suing Diamond/Ad Populum over allegations of fraud, and Diamond/Ad Populum suing AENT for allegations of breaking confidentiality and poaching staff, we have borne witness to some of the inner machinations of both parties. And have been able to create a timeline, including the allegations each side made. AE is Alliance Entertainment, AD is Ad Populum, and BC is Bleeding Cool. The times stated are Pacific. Keep in mind that most of these details are the assertions of the two parties in their respective lawsuits, but once you put all of that available information onto a timeline, a few events slot into place.

Title: How a little-known tax change sparked a tech layoff surge

The big picture: A subtle but far-reaching shift in US tax law has upended the financial foundation of the technology industry, accelerating a wave of layoffs and reshaping how companies approach innovation. While headlines have pointed to over-hiring, economic volatility, and the rise of artificial intelligence as causes for the mass job losses in tech, a less visible factor has quietly played a pivotal role: a change to Section 174 of the tax code that dramatically altered how research and development costs are treated. For nearly seventy years, US companies could immediately deduct the full cost of their research and development activities, from engineering salaries to software development and contractor fees. This policy, rooted in Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code since 1954, encouraged businesses to invest in innovation and keep R&D operations within the United States. The approach fostered the growth of iconic tech giants and allowed startups and established firms alike to take risks, experiment, and expand rapidly. That landscape changed in 2022, when a provision from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had been delayed, took effect. To offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate, lawmakers required that R&D expenses be spread out, or amortized, over five years for domestic activities and fifteen years for foreign ones, rather than being deducted all at once. This adjustment, designed as a political maneuver to make the tax bill appear fiscally balanced, was largely unknown outside tax and accounting circles until its real-world consequences became impossible to ignore. The impact was immediate and severe. When companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules, they found themselves unable to offset their R&D spending against taxable income fully. For cash-strapped firms and those not yet profitable, the result was a sudden and painful increase in tax bills, just as venture funding was drying up and borrowing costs were rising. The financial pressure forced companies to make tough decisions, and in many cases, the largest and most flexible expense – headcount – was the first to be reduced. Since the start of 2023, the tech industry has shed more than half a million jobs, with some of the biggest names in the industry making substantial cuts. Meta reduced its workforce by nearly a quarter, Microsoft trimmed about 7 percent, and Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce all eliminated thousands of positions, often in product development and engineering – the very teams most affected by the loss of immediate R&D deductions. Smaller firms, lacking the financial cushion of industry giants, faced even harsher realities. Twilio, Shopify, and Coinbase each slashed significant portions of their staff, with reductions of 22 percent, nearly 30 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, over the past two years. R&D operations were particularly hard hit. The effects have not been limited to traditional tech companies. Throughout the 2010s, a wide array of businesses, ranging from retail to logistics and healthcare, relied on the same tax treatment to justify significant investments in software, data analytics, and internal tools. The Section 174 change disrupted this model, pushing many companies from a position of taxable loss to taxable income, even when their actual cash flow had not improved. As a result, the layoffs and cutbacks have rippled through the broader digital economy, which, together with core tech, accounts for about 20 percent of US GDP. The magnitude of the layoffs has been strikingly disproportionate compared to other sectors. While most industries saw job cuts in the low single digits, tech experienced a 60 percent surge in layoffs between 2022 and 2023, with entire divisions – especially in R&D – vanishing almost overnight. The consequences extend beyond the companies themselves, affecting local economies and service industries that rely on high-paid tech workers to sustain demand for everything from housing to restaurants and transportation. As Congress debates whether to reverse the Section 174 change, the politics remain complex. Restoring the old rules would reduce tax revenue and could be seen as favoring large corporations, even as the broader economic fallout continues. For many workers and communities already affected, any relief may come too late.

Title: Now Diamond's New Owner Ad Populum Sues Alliance Entertainment (AENT)

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond Diamond Comic Distributors' new owner Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop is suing Alliance Entertainment (AENT) over trade secrets and staff hiring Ad Populum, under their subsidiary company Sparkle Pop, the new owners of Diamond Comic Distributors, have launched a lawsuit against Alliance Entertainment or AENT. The suit alleges that AENT stole trade secrets from Diamond and poached employees during Diamond's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. This comes after AENT made a winning, if challenged and court-confirmed, bid for Diamond, only to then withdraw their offer, leaving Ad Populum and Universal Distribution as joint back-up winners. Then AENT sued Diamond Comic Distributors, alleging fraud over the bankruptcy auction and sale. And subsequently, AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop accuses Alliance Entertainment/AENT of "brazen disregard of binding non-disclosure and non-solicitation obligations and its theft of valuable trade secrets". That they "abused the bankruptcy process to gain inside access to Diamond Comics employees, trade secrets, and proprietary information, all while delaying the sale of assets to legitimate purchasers." And that "when Sparkle Pop finally closed the sale of Diamond Comics, Alliance pulled the rug out from under both seller and buyer, engaging in a sudden and coordinated raid to poach seven key Diamond Comics sales and marketing employees, effectively hobbling the business. Alliance also exploited its inside knowledge of Diamond Comics' confidential information to usurp key distribution relationships with vendors and customers, further undermining the business." According to the complaint, Alliance signed a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement (NDA) in October 2024 to access Diamond Comics' confidential information, including customer lists, vendor relationships, and financial data, as part of the bidding process. This also reveals that the Diamond Comic Distributors bankruptcy process began a lot earlier than had previously been thought, and something that will be of interest to comics publishers and other suppliers who were providing product to Diamond at that time, without that knowledge, until early January 2025. Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop states "Alliance has violated these strictures openly, effectively daring its counterparties and victims to sue if they want any hope of redress. This lawsuit responds to that challenge." The lawsuit claims that Alliance, after initially winning the auction in March 2025, refused to close the deal on "spurious grounds" just one day before the scheduled closing date. This allowed Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop and Universal Distribution to step in, closing the deal on the 15th of May. However, Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop alleges that Alliance exploited its access to Diamond Comics' confidential information to orchestrate a "coordinated raid" on the company's workforce and business relationships. The complaint details how, on the 16th of May, Diamond Comics' head of sales, Mike Schimmel, abruptly resigned, followed by six other key sales and purchasing employees a week later. Bleeding Cool identified them as; These employees, who the suit says had access to critical trade secrets, were allegedly hired by Alliance in violation of the NDA, which prohibited soliciting or hiring Diamond Comic employees until October 2026. Sparkle Pop further claims that Alliance used the confidential information to target Diamond Comics' Amazon distribution channel. According to the Sparkle Pop complaint, one former Diamond employee, Joe Lunday, reportedly urged Amazon to shift its business to Alliance. The lawsuit accuses Alliance of violating the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Maryland Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as well as tortiously interfering with employment contracts and the bankruptcy proceedings. Sparkle Pop is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, statutory double damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief to prevent Alliance from employing the allegedly poached workers, using Diamond Comics trade secrets, or soliciting its business partners, including Amazon. A cease-and-desist letter sent by Diamond Comics' counsel to Alliance on the 2nd of June reportedly went unanswered. Alliance Entertainment, based in Florida, has not yet responded to the lawsuit. It may also be notable that on the infamous Beyond Wednesdays podcast that AENT CEO Bruce Ogilvie appeared on, he stated that he had to reach out to the Raymond James firm, which was running the bankruptcy, and tried to buy Diamond before entering Chapter 11. The court case states that Raymond James reached out to AENT, and they signed the NDA in October, three months before entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It might be worth Bleeding Cool revisiting the timeline for the whole Chapter 11 affair. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool.

Title: Amazon fires people working at Goodreads and the Kindle division

Last month, Amazon fired 100 people working in its devices and services unit, the group overseeing development of such diverse products as the Kindle, Echo speakers, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox self-driving cars. A couple of days ago Amazon had another round layoffs, which included fewer than 100 people from the Goodreads social book discovery website and the Kindle division. CEO Andy Jassy is undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our business roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reminded staff that developing enormous teams and personal fiefdoms is not the way to success at the company, emphasizing that the online retail giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Rather than mass layoffs, Amazon accomplished this goal by consolidating teams and reassigning some supervisors to individual contributor positions. via Reuters Michael Kozlowski is the editor-in-chief at Good e-Reader and has written about audiobooks and e-readers for the past fifteen years.

Title: Moguls Take Aim at Zaslav’s Vision of WBD as Company Splits: ‘It Was a Failure’

Said one top executive: “It’s a deal that never had a shot and shouldn’t have been done. But they’ve also done a terrible job running the company” In the narrow hallways where media moguls trade in brutal trash talk, David Zaslav’s move to split Warner Bros. Discovery into two companies — studio and streaming on one side and Turner-Discovery cable channels on the other — is being judged particularly harshly. Sure, say Zaslav’s peers, decoupling the streaming and content-producing side from the declining linear world makes sense now. NBCUniversal just did the same, spinning off its cable channels into a new entity, Versant. Lionsgate has just separated streamer Starz from its studio. But Zaslav only arrived in Hollywood a hot minute ago, bringing a vision of creating a 21st-century Hollywood studio with barely enough time to buy the Beverly Hills digs of producer Robert Evans, get a convertible Rolls-Royce and hang out at the Polo Lounge. What was the point, after all, of combining Warner Bros. with Discovery in order to create streaming scale to compete with Netflix and Disney+ in 2022, if only to unwind the whole thing three years later with a 60% drop in the Warner share price? “This whole thing was a waste of time,” said one openly-disgusted media executive, one of several who spoke to WaxWord. “They lost tremendous shareholder value. It was a failure.” This executive added: “It’s a deal that never had a shot and shouldn’t have been done. But they’ve also done a terrible job running the company.” “The cable bundle has been rotting the business for the past eight years,” said another top media executive, who also declined to be named. “For him [Zaslav] and [shareholder John] Malone — as much Malone as Zaslav — they were trying to exit Discovery.” And doing so bought more time, at the expense of WBD employees, who have already experienced several rounds of layoffs and face heightened uncertainty now. Spinning out the cable channels “is a huge problem off his plate. It gives it to Gunnar [Wiedenfels, WBD’s CFO],” said yet a third top media executive. “Everyone is doing it — Lionsgate, Comcast, now Warner Bros. and the last person who’ll figure it out is [Disney CEO] Bob Iger.” Doing the AT&T deal in 2022 may not have helped Warner, but it helped Zaslav. “He’s still at the table. If he hadn’t done the deal, he’d own Scripps and Discovery, and those things are the great disappearing act,” said this executive. “So he paid way too much, but he’s still at the table. In the end, for him, it was great. For the shareholders, it’s a disaster.” The overpayment is what has made Zaslav’s challenge particularly daunting, saddling the company with a stunning amount of debt that is now down to $37 billion for a company with a $26 billion market cap. The spinoff will require another $17.5 billion loan. But Warner executives, not surprisingly, see it differently. In his call with analysts on Monday, Zaslav observed that he’d grown the Max streaming service – despite renaming it three different times – to a global content force. “When we formed WBD, HBO Max was largely a domestic streaming service that lacked scale, basic technological proficiencies and a differentiated content strategy, as well as losing more than $2 billion,” he said. “We remain on track to surpass 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026 and to deliver at least $1.3 billion in Adjusted EBITDA this year.” The company reported 122 million streaming subscribers in Q1, including 57 million domestically. But Zaslav’s missteps have been well documented: renaming HBO Max to Max (they’ve reverted); betting that HBO Max and Discovery+ subscribers would cross over and enjoy each other’s content (they didn’t); figuring that no one would really care if he shelved a couple of completed movies (the creative community had a new Big Bad at the studios). And one former HBO executive reflected the concern among those who toiled at the premium network: “It is another (sad) attempt to salvage a sinking ship,” said this individual. “I have spoken with a few of my former surviving colleagues from the ‘glory’ days and they are quite concerned that this is another nothing-burger that gets press and does not move the needle as a long-term strategy. They are concerned about cuts and the devaluation of their work.” But perhaps the most salient outcome of the split announced on Monday is the likelihood that both Warner Bros. and the Turner cable properties will become targets for M&A, as each becomes small enough to attract an acquirer once the split happens next year. “Anyone who thinks that Warner-HBO thing is going to continue as an independent company is missing what’s going on here,” said the second executive. “That thing is extremely attractive. It’s small enough in net value for any of those [streamers] – Netflix, Amazon, Disney – to buy it. Which they will.” The third executive agreed. “This is just setting everyone up for the next M&A dance,” he said. “We know these things trade for 12-15x EBITDA, and they get sold 15-30x. That’s what Amazon paid for MGM. But none of that is going to happen when you’re dragging along a dead body. How do you get ‘Weekend at Bernie’s’ and cut the dead corpse loose?” This executive argued that ultimately Disney will need to do the same with its linear properties, including ABC and ESPN. Merging Warner with Discovery “was a huge miscalculation, but was it any more a miscalculation than Iger made in buying Fox? He spent $71 billion for a bunch of cable assets. Both these guys thought they were buying a studio with a bunch of IP and linear was coming along. But it turned out the linear fell off a cliff.” Warner vehemently disputed that its version of SpinCo would be a “dead body,” and said that Wiedenfels was committed to investing further. “There is a misperception that our Global Networks is the same bad bank as Versant is,” said a Warner executive. “It’s definitively different and set up to have a chance to do well, stretch its wings, see what it can do. It’s global. It has digital assets. We didn’t cleave off a favorite network like Bravo – they’re all going. And it will have up to a 20% stake in the streaming and studios.” The first executive strongly disagreed, arguing that CNN faces a particularly dire future. “It’s a really bad day for CNN. The two biggest brands on that side of the equation are TNT and CNN. [TNT] now goes forward without the NBA. And CNN has been incredibly diminished.” Historians will argue over whether the pivotal moment for a glorious legacy brand like Warner Bros. was the $85 billion sale to AT&T in 2018. It took only three years for AT&T to then pivot and spin out that asset in the merger with Discovery led by Zaslav. All three top executives said that move merely staved off the inevitable outcome on Monday, resulting from the linear decline that most Hollywood legacy studios failed to predict. “All of them together missed the one fact, which is obvious here: The white walkers were coming,” said the second executive. “The fact that you’re following the Starks, the Lanisters, whoever – who cares? That was all going to happen.” WBD stock closed down 29 cents on Monday, to $9.53. Lucas Manfredi contributed to this article.
