This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → GroupM’s rechristening as WPP Media last week was intended to answer questions posed by clients, staffers and industry critics about the future of what was once the industry’s largest media investment house. But beyond the sizzle reel, question marks remain over what’s actually changed — and whether this is the end of WPP’s long-running quest to turn the ship around, or just the latest chapter. In particular, there are queries around the company’s AI ambitions; how close they are to becoming reality; what that reality means for its own employees; and how they help it put clear blue water between itself and rival heavyweight media holdcos Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (soon to include IPG). GroupM is gone, and WPP Media has been set up in its place. Going forward under its new captain Brian Lesser (who is also its old captain), the network will operate with a single P&L model in each country, while the global CEO positions of its constituent agencies have been abolished. Former Wavemaker CEO Toby Jenner has been instead named global chief business officer, while Mindshare’s Adam Gerhart has taken on a brief as chief client officer, for example. “Advertisers don’t like disruption. They don’t like not knowing what’s going to happen with their team. They don’t like when they start spending more time thinking about their own business than their clients,” said Tom Denford, CEO and co-founder of media consultancy ID Comms. This isn’t just about tidying up the org chart, but a significant shakeup in the engine room of WPP. Execs are keen to push the benefits of the bespoke cross-disciplinary teams it’s built for clients like Amazon, Unilever and Coca-Cola. In each case, the custom units combine media, creative and data capabilities, and are built with WPP’s data businesses Choreograph and Infosum (acquired just two months ago) as connective tissue. Lauren Wetzel, CEO of InfoSum, referred to this approach as “showing up as one company.” WPP Media’s leaders believe more clients want the white glove treatment – and a simplified organization structure makes those teams easier to assemble and easier to run. “Clients want us to come together and have an integrated offering,” said Wetzel. Behind the scenes, the changes have already led to significant job cuts at the network, though a WPP spokesperson declined to say exactly how many of its 40,000 staffers were made redundant. Layoffs will continue until at least June, per Ad Age. Incumbent clients, however, are keen to be reassured their own account teams remain in place. They want both continuity of service, and to be reassured they won’t be forgotten when WPP Media goes hunting for new custom in its fresh costume. Perhaps that explains why, despite retiring the 20-year old GroupM moniker (originally intended to manage WPP’s sprawling media agency domains, rather than a market vehicle in its own right) the Mindshare, Wavemaker, and EssenceMediacom agency brands remain intact. Digiday understands that the agency brands will aid WPP Media in navigating potential client conflicts, while also pitching for new work in their own right. According to Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, the remaining firewalls, combined with the addition of Infosum, will also help reassure clients that other advertisers won’t have access to their data. The new structure will “wall off their clients’ first-party data from any losses in data fidelity, or security or privacy concerns,” said Pattisall. WPP Media’s leadership aren’t using the “a” word to describe the new entity. Not that one, anyway. No longer a network of media agencies, WPP Media will instead function as an “AI-driven media company”, per the spiel of a B2B ad campaign it’s launched to float the rebrand. In plain English, that refers to the way its teams use WPP Open, the company’s AI operating system, as well as other AI tools and automation. According to Evan Hanlon, global CEO at WPP data business Choreograph, every team within the business is already using Open to plan and invest media on behalf of clients. This will supposedly free them from the “drudgery” of manual media planning and enable them to pursue more creative solutions. “It’s something that our people are not only in every day, but that our clients are seeing and experiencing and having work delivered for them,” said Hanlon. Even if clients choose only to work with EssenceMediacom or Wavemaker, rather than the cross-border packages WPP Media is prioritizing, they’ll still be customers of teams using Open. “Every client that we onboard now is being onboarded into that end-to-end, AI-powered ecosystem,” said Hanlon. “Through the end of the year, we’re looking to bring 100% of WPP Media onto that workflow as well.” Teams aren’t limited to using WPP’s proprietary toolbox, but can integrate tech that clients have built in-house as well. “We are not putting our clients in a position in which they have to lock into a fixed, inflexible, closed system,” he said. WPP Media isn’t the only media network to have switched to a single P&L, or to remodel its interior around a data business. And it’s far from the only way advertisers can access AI tech. However, Hanlon said WPP Media’s approach to audience data would be the element that helps it stand out from the crowd. Rather than sell access to audience datasets it owns – and compete directly with Meta or Google – WPP Media aims, through InfoSum’s clean room tech, to help clients leverage the first part data they do have, and provide probabilistic audience targeting. It’s a solution clients can’t easily build in-house or get from the tech giants, and one that should keep advertisers above the water line on privacy compliance. “Every one of our competitors is pursuing a strategy that is focused around owning large-scale audience datasets as the focal point for how they extract more value from the marketplace,” said Hanlon. Deterministic approaches, he said, are just “one of many” ways to target media. “We think that is one place that we are fundamentally different to our competitors.” If its leaders can articulate that offer in the pitch room, it could be compelling for clients, according to Sam Tomlinson, chief client officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “WPP Media will need to work through this integration quickly so they can then focus on a clear articulation of the benefits of their data strategy, building on InfoSum and explaining how it is different to their competitors,” he said. Ultimately, Forrester’s Pattisall believes WPP Media as described has a strong chance to improve its fortunes, regardless of whether it keeps any clients that might be in play (such as Mars, which is currently in review and which WPP CEO Mark Read acknowledged is in play back at the end of April). “They’ve made massive acquisitions, they’ve consolidated their operations and they’re providing end-to-end services rather than point solutions,” said Pattisall. “It’s certainly working for Publicis Media, it’s working for Omnicom Media Group … I think it would work for WPP Media as well.” — Michael Bürgi contributed to this report. As influencers and creators capture more attention (and ad dollars) from marketers and agencies looking to break through with prospective customers, Advertiser Perceptions looked into how they’re being used and evaluated, as well as how dollars are being allocated. Some highlights from the study, which surveyed 305 marketing and agency folk: “I would not at all be surprised that sooner than later, influencer [as a] channel will be much bigger than television. I don’t know if it will be in three years or five years, but that’s something which is going to happen.” An IPO for the Ryan Reynolds—linked firm with a colorful past caps off a varied 1H. Principals at two agencies extol the virtues of minimal staffing and maximum use of freelance as a means of flexibility.

Title: BYD Overtakes Tesla in Europe for the First Time, Sales Jump 169 Percent

Editor Economy Mike Shedlock, MishTalk BYD sold 7,231 battery electric vehicles in April versus 7,165 by Tesla, according to data from Jato Dynamics. BYD Is #1 In Europe Please note BYD overtakes Tesla in Europe BYD sold more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than market leader Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as the Chinese carmaker continued to make inroads despite hefty tariffs on cars imported from the mainland. Shenzhen-based BYD, which also makes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), sold 7,231 BEVs in April, a year-on-year increase of 169 per cent, according to data compiled by market research firm Jato Dynamics from 28 countries in Europe. Tesla’s sales fell 49 per cent to 7,165 units in the same period. “Although the difference between the two brands’ monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,” said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, on Thursday. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.” Despite huge tariffs imposed by the European Union (EU), Chinese firms’ BEV sales jumped 59 per cent year on year in April to nearly 15,300 units, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the US posted a 26 per cent increase in sales, it added. In the PHEV segment, Chinese carmakers’ sales surged 546 per cent year on year to 9,649 units, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of PHEVs registered in the bloc. In response to disruptions from US tariffs, the EU and China are negotiating the European levies and exploring the possibility of setting a price floor for Chinese EVs. Chinese EV makers are also speeding up the construction of factories on the continent to counter the tariffs. BYD’s first European car factory in Hungary is expected to start production in the second half of this year. BYD also planned to establish its European headquarters and a new research and development centre in Hungary, CEO and president Wang Chuanfu said this week. BYDs would sell in the US too were it not for 100 percent tariffs. Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? On May 4, 2025, I asked Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? Zoomers? I am sure many would say yes, but there’s a catch. But the Toyota bZ3X is real, and it is actually on sale starting at that price. There is a catch: To buy one, you have to be in China. Tesla has two models widely available—Model 3 and Model Y—and both have been on the market for years. China’s BYD has about 25 models, according to the market-analysis firm Inovev, and is constantly introducing more. Pay More – Get Less That is Trump’s unofficial motto as well as the UAW and Teamsters. The BZ3X would be a hot seller in the US at $15,000 or even $20,000. But Trump wants you to to pay more. His 145 percent tariff that would price the car at $37,000 or so. Trump finds it easy to get the economically clueless on his side with chants of “They are stealing out jobs; they are ripping us off; and it’s unfair trade”. Trump never asks, would you like a $15,000 EV Toyota Related Posts April 14, 2025: Trump’s Plan to Make Manufacturing Great Again in Pictures The share of manufacturing employment keeps declining.

Title: Middle managers, beware: The Great Flattening layoff trend has moved beyond Big Tech and into retailers like Walmart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-manager-layoffs-walmart-big-tech-great-flattening-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-30T07:49:02Z

It's a tough time to be a middle manager. Companies are looking for ways to cut costs, and mid-career employees' jobs are increasingly on the chopping block. Earlier this year, Big Tech giants like Google, Intel, and Amazon announced their plans to lay off thousands of workers, mostly managers. Last week, the trend hit Walmart, which said it will "remove layers and complexity" by reducing its labor force by 1,500 people, many of them in midlevel corporate roles. Retailer Wayfair also recently laid off managers, and some companies like fintech firm Block are moving managers into non-management roles. The latest manager purge is partially a symptom of a US economy rocked by recession fears and federal tariff whiplash. Several companies — including Walmart — have begun to raise prices because President Donald Trump's proposed levies are hiking their overhead costs. Reducing higher-paid, midlevel employees is another way for them to save money and streamline corporate bureaucracy. What's more, workplace efficiency is en vogue at the federal level, with Elon Musk and the White House's DOGE office spearheading a widespread staff reduction at government agencies. It's all adding up to 2025's "Great Flattening." Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via Signal at alliekelly.10; here's our guide to sharing information securely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023 alongside a bout of Meta layoffs that "flatter is faster." "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy similarly said in 2024, "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today." Daniel Zhao, lead economist at the job-search platform Glassdoor, told Business Insider that this flattening isn't a random financial fluke, but the result of yearslong labor market trends. He said companies across industries opted for "rapid headcount growth" in the early pandemic years. To accommodate a slew of new hires, many of these companies needed more middle managers to train young talent. Zhao added that some companies were primed to "hand out promotions into the management ranks to attract and retain high performers during the labor shortages era" of the early 2020s. With recent hiring slowdowns, Zhao said that this inflated middle management tier is becoming less necessary. "When the economy shifts into a lower gear, companies start looking for where they can cut workforce costs, often looking at high-salaried managers," he said. "And as companies slow down hiring, the need for onboarding and training new workers diminishes." Despite this trend, the labor market is still strong on paper, and overall, layoffs are low. And, while "The Great Flattening" is ramping up, it also isn't new. Big Tech's layoffs of early- and mid-career workers have been happening on and off for years. Walmart's recent announcement signals that the strategy is gaining broader appeal. Gallup reported that overall employee engagement dropped to its lowest level in a decade last year, and Glassdoor's Employee Confidence Index shows that less than half of midlevel employees have a positive business outlook about their employers as of April, the lowest figure since the job-search platform began measuring employee confidence in 2016. Glassdoor data published in November also shows that laid-off middle managers often have to take lower-seniority or lower-salaried positions to break back into the workforce. Those who aren't laid off and remain managers could find themselves with an overwhelming amount of direct reports. BI has heard from over 750 Americans of all ages about their experiences with the job market. Some are boomeranging back to old employers, while others are left empty-handed despite hundreds of applications. Many job seekers have become so frustrated by rejections and ghosting that they're taking whatever roles they can find. Zhao said the flattening is likely to impact more than just managers. Each industry hit by layoffs could disrupt its traditional career ladder, especially for young people. As Zhao put it: "This trend also creates bunching down at the bottom of the career ladder as former managers compete for roles that traditionally would be opportunities for entry-level or experienced hires to move up the career ladder."

(Arielle Zionts, 5/29) Feds Chop Enforcement Staff and Halt Rules Meant To Curb Black Lung in Coal Miners The Trump administration has paused implementation of a rule limiting miners’ exposure to airborne silica dust days after a federal court agreed to put it on hold to hear an industry challenge. The protections are meant to head off a surge in cases of black lung disease. Meanwhile, any enforcement of new standards might be meager due to workforce cuts. (Taylor Sisk, 5/29) Language Service Cutbacks Raise Fear of Medical Errors, Misdiagnoses, Deaths Federal cuts are hurting community organizations in California that provide language assistance services to people who speak limited English. Despite President Trump’s executive order declaring English the national language, millions in the U.S. need help navigating the health system. (Vanessa G.

Administration News CMS Requests Hospitals' Data Related To Transgender Care In Children Hospitals will have to submit information on their policies and procedures as well as any adverse events related to gender-affirming procedures, The Hill reports. Plus, HHS has a new deputy general counsel to work on psychedelics policy, and news outlets list Medicaid's defenders. The Hill: CMS Demands Hospital Data About Gender-Affirming Care For Minors The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent letters Wednesday to hospitals that provide transgender care services to children, demanding data on their quality standards and finances. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz sent letters to “select hospitals,” giving them 30 days to provide specific information on “medical interventions for gender dysphoria in children.” (Choi, 5/28) The 19th: Where Anti-Trans State Bills Stand In 2025 Since 2020, every new year has brought a new record of state bills attempting to roll back transgender rights. Most of that legislation has not become law. Even as the sheer volume of bills continues to grow, LGBTQ+ advocates continue to defeat the majority of them. But each year, Republicans introduce more and more bills. And each year, those bills become broader and more extreme, as politicians look for new ways to enforce a binary definition of gender — and that escalation is turning up in the bills that do pass. (Rummler, 5/28) In federal hiring and cuts — Politico: A Psychedelics Hire At HHS A well-known drug-policy lawyer is joining the Department of Health and Human Services to work on psychedelics policy, according to two sources with knowledge of the move who requested anonymity because it hasn’t been announced yet, POLITICO’s Natalie Fertig reports. Matt Zorn ... has been involved in numerous cannabis and psychedelics cases over the years, including representing one of the parties selected to participate in the DEA’s administrative law hearings regarding the ongoing effort to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. (Schumaker, 5/28) KFF Health News: Language Service Cutbacks Raise Fear Of Medical Errors, Misdiagnoses, Deaths Health nonprofits and medical interpreters warn that federal cuts have eliminated dozens of positions in California for community workers who help non-English speakers sign up for insurance coverage and navigate the health care system. At the same time, people with limited English proficiency have scaled back their requests for language services, which health care advocates attribute in part to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and his executive order declaring English as the national language. (Sánchez and Orozco Rodriguez, 5/29) KFF Health News: Feds Chop Enforcement Staff And Halt Rules Meant To Curb Black Lung In Coal Miners In early April, President Donald Trump gathered dozens of hard-hat-clad coal miners around him in the White House East Room. He joked about arm-wrestling them and announced he was signing executive orders to boost coal production, “bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” and to “put the miners back to work.” Trump said he calls it “beautiful, clean” coal. “I tell my people never use the word ‘coal’ unless you put ‘beautiful, clean’ before it.” (Sisk, 5/29) Regarding Medicaid — The Hill: Josh Hawley Stakes Ground As Chief GOP Defender Of Medicaid Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is staking out his spot as a populist defender of Medicaid in opposition to the steep cuts contained in the House-passed megabill to fund President Trump’s domestic agenda. The senior senator from Missouri — who as the state’s attorney general once signed on to a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act — has made his position clear: He will not support a bill that cuts Medicaid benefits. Hawley has long warned his party against Medicaid cuts; the $800 billion question is whether other senators will join him. (Weixel, 5/28) CBS News: Philadelphia Protesters Urge Sen. McCormick To Vote Against Medicaid Cutting Legislation A rally in Philadelphia Wednesday drew dozens of people to fight against proposed cuts to Medicaid. It's legislation that Republicans say will only go after wasteful spending and fraud. That legislation is now headed for the Senate. Wednesday's message was focused on the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, urging him to vote against legislation passed by the House that would cut an estimated $800 billion from Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income Americans. The reductions would come from work requirements and other provisions. (Stahl and Nau, 5/28) North Carolina Health News: Medicaid Work Rule Could Burden N.C. Agencies The possibility of North Carolinians who depend on Medicaid being subject to a work requirement to keep their coverage has grown more plausible with the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a GOP-backed budget bill that includes the measure. Legislation approved by the U.S. House on May 22 would require “able-bodied” adults enrolled in Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 3 million people in North Carolina, to prove that they work, volunteer or attend school for at least 80 hours a month. (Baxley, 5/29) KFF Health News: A Medicaid Patient Had A Heart Attack While Traveling. He Owed Almost $78,000 On Christmas Day at the WaTiki indoor water park, Hans Wirt was getting winded from following his son up the stairs to the waterslides. Wirt’s breathing became more labored once they returned to the nearby hotel where they and Wirt’s girlfriend were staying while visiting family in Rapid City, South Dakota. (Zionts, 5/29) Global actions — MedPage Today: Germany Plans Global Alternative To PubMed On March 1, the world's largest database for biomedical literature -- PubMed -- went down, immediately causing a global panic that the nation's essential publishing resource was yet another casualty of the new administration's many budget cuts and executive orders. ... Though the outage was apparently just a glitch and PubMed was back up the next day, the pause in the ability to access published research prompted the fear that PubMed could disappear, and soon. ... Now that fear has spurred some to action, but not in the U.S. (Clark, 5/28) Axios: China Looks To Grow Its Influence Over WHO China is becoming a top donor country to WHO after promising this month that it'll make a $500 million gift over five years to the group. President Trump announced in January that he's pulling the United States out of WHO, leaving a power vacuum within the global health consortium that Beijing is trying to fill. (Goldman, 5/29) Also — CBS News: If These Items Are In Your Medicine Cabinet, It's Time To Throw Them Away. Here's How To Do It Safely While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agrees taking expired medications carries certain health risks, the agency also recognizes, in some cases, "testing has shown that certain properly stored medical products can be used beyond their labeled expiration date if they retain their stability." ... The Cleveland Clinic suggests keeping a few things in mind if you are considering taking an expired medication, including the type of drug. "Taking some expired ibuprofen for a headache is probably OK. But using expired insulin for diabetes or nitroglycerin for angina is a different story," the clinic says.

Kennedy announced the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is rolling back COVID-19 vaccination recommendations for kids and pregnant women. ... Kennedy called the latest move "common sense and good science", but some health experts said the restrictions could have some significant public health impacts. Chicago-area doctors call this change unscientific and "incorrect." (Price and Rezaei, 5/28) Becker's Hospital Review: COVID-19 Shot Guidance Change Draws Industry Scrutiny The CDC’s decision to remove COVID-19 vaccines from its recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women has sparked significant concern from healthcare industry groups. While some groups, like the American Hospital Association, took a more neutral stance, others scrutinized the move for bypassing the CDC’s expert advisory group and potentially threatening vaccine access and public health. (Bean, 5/28) NBC News: FDA Chief Says Pregnant Women Should Decide On Covid Vaccine With Doctors The Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, said Wednesday that the decision of whether a pregnant woman should get a Covid vaccine should come down to a conversation with her doctor — not a recommendation by the federal government.

Kennedy Jr.’s announcement Tuesday revoking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that Covid shots should be offered to pregnant women and healthy children. (Lovelace Jr., Tsirkin and Sonnier, 5/28) The 19th: What The Latest COVID Vaccine Changes Mean For Pregnant People And Children Removing COVID vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for pregnant people or children could impact the availability of the vaccines or if they are covered by insurance. Dr. Sean T. O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that removing the recommendation “could strip families of choice.” (Rodriguez and Kutz, 5/28) The Washington Post: CDC Blindsided As RFK Jr. Changes Vaccine Recommendations Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scrambling to understand Kennedy’s decision, announced in a 58-second video on X on Tuesday morning, which took agency staff by surprise. Five hours later, CDC officials received a one-page “secretarial directive,” dated May 19 and signed by Kennedy, that contradicts some of what he said in his video, according to two current and one former health officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. (Sun, 5/28) Also — CNN: HHS Cancels $590 Million Contract With Moderna For Bird Flu Vaccine The US Department of Health and Human Services is terminating a contract with drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect against bird flu amid the agency’s broader efforts to reevaluate therapies that use mRNA technology.

(Cameron, 5/28) Fierce Healthcare: How Grow Therapy Hopes To Curb Patient Dropout During Referrals When providers work together, patients are more likely to get their needs met at the right place and the right time. This leads to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In outpatient behavioral health, a certain subset of patients need intensive or specialized care. But referrals to higher levels of care are often inefficient and risk patients dropping out of treatment altogether. (Gliadkovskaya, 5/28) From the health care sector — Modern Healthcare: ChristianaCare To Run Operations At 5 Crozer Health Facilities ChristianaCare plans to assume operations of five Crozer Health outpatient facilities in Pennsylvania after submitting the highest bid of $50.3 million.

(DeSilva, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: Cleveland Clinic Updates Outpatient Copay Policy After Backlash Cleveland Clinic is revamping an outpatient copay policy before it was scheduled to take effect, following concerns about disrupting care. Cleveland Clinic said earlier this month it would require copays for nonemergency outpatient services at or before appointment times starting June 1. If patients couldn't pay, their appointments would be canceled or rescheduled. However, the health system is backing away from that tactic and instead offering to set up 0% interest payment plans for patients to keep their appointments. (Hudson, 5/28) St. Louis Public Radio: Phelps Health Expands Ambulance Service For Rural Missouri Rural hospitals closing and population and traffic increasing along Interstate 44 are putting more pressure on the hospital in Rolla to handle growing patient loads, especially for emergency services.

(DeSilva, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans Reverse Course On GLP-1 Coverage A handful of nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers dipped their toes into expanding coverage for blockbuster weight-loss drugs. Then they quickly pulled them back out. It’s still early days of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, or GLP-1, drug phenomenon with no definitive clinical or cost-savings evidence and no blueprint for how to control spending. What is clear is the immediate consequences these costly medications have had for health insurance company bottom lines.

As part of federal staffing cuts and encouraged retirement, the U.S. corps of food safety inspectors has significantly shrunk. Remaining officials now carry double the workload, leading experts to sound warning bells about the future outlook for food safety in this country. Other public health news reports on gut infections, aging, covid, measles, and more. NPR: How Safe Is The Food Supply After Federal Cutbacks? Experts Are Worried Paula Soldner inspected meat and poultry plants around southern Wisconsin for 38 years: "I'm talking brats, hot dogs, summer sausage, pizza." Her Department of Agriculture job required daily check-ups on factories to ensure slicers were cleaned on schedule, for example. Her signoff allowed plants to put red-white-and-blue "USDA inspected" stickers on grocery-store packages. Last month, Soldner took the Trump administration up on its offer of early retirement, joining an exodus from the Food Safety and Inspection Service that began under President Biden's reorganization of the agency last year. (Noguchi, 5/29) CIDRAP: People's Gut Infections Often Traced To Poultry, Cattle, Turtles A surveillance study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report suggests that a lack of disease-prevention knowledge among owners of animals such as backyard poultry contributes to intestinal-disease outbreaks in the United States.

Politico: States Take The Reins On Insurance Reform Congressional lawmakers have tried and failed several times to push through a bipartisan, health-industry-backed bill that would speed up health insurers’ prior authorization processes for certain prescription drugs and medical services. Congress will launch another attempt this year, but a growing number of blue and red states have taken the matter into their own hands. In 2024, at least 10 states passed laws to reform the prior authorization process, according to a report from the American Medical Association. Insurers use prior authorization to control costs. The state action continues to increase in 2025. (Hooper and Cirruzzo, 5/28) AP: Utah Republicans Face Pressure To Reconsider Gender-Affirming Care Ban In Light Of New Report When Utah Republicans passed a ban on gender-affirming health care for children and teens in 2023, they argued it was needed to protect vulnerable kids from treatments that could cause long-term harm.

Title: What Recent Tech Layoffs Reveal About The 2025 Job Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewfennell/2025/05/29/what-recent-tech-layoffs-reveal-about-the-2025-job-market/
Time Published: 2025-05-29T12:19:06Z

ByAndrew Fennell ByAndrew Fennell, Contributor. In April alone, more than 23,000 tech workers lost their jobs. Klarna, Duolingo, Cisco, and Amazon all made sweeping cuts – but not in the areas you might expect. While some teams are shrinking, others are growing. The 2025 job market isn’t collapsing – it’s restructuring. These layoffs aren’t just about cost-cutting. They’re a signal of how the workplace is shifting: automation is accelerating, skill demands are evolving, and job security is increasingly tied to how adaptable you are. Here’s what the recent tech layoffs reveal – and what you can do about it. The current wave of layoffs isn’t a simple result of poor earnings or pandemic aftershocks. Companies are streamlining to shift investment into AI and automation. Klarna announced cuts to its customer experience and marketing departments shortly after revealing a major AI chatbot rollout. Cisco trimmed 4,000 roles to focus on AI-enabled networking. Duolingo, despite strong growth, cut staff as it leans into automated content generation. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech job losses in April 2025 marked the second-highest monthly total since early 2023. These aren’t panic layoffs – they’re part of a realignment toward a leaner, AI-augmented future. If you dig into the affected departments, a clear pattern emerges. Customer support, operations, and marketing teams are taking the brunt of cuts – especially where automation is viable. Generalist and mid-level roles, particularly those without tech specialisation, are proving vulnerable. Internal functions like HR, recruiting, and learning and development are also being consolidated or outsourced in many organisations. The pressure is greatest on roles that don’t directly contribute to AI products or data infrastructure – or can be replaced by them. This doesn’t mean you need to be a coder to stay employed. But it does mean you need to understand how your role interacts with emerging tech. The same companies issuing layoffs are aggressively hiring in other departments. Salesforce has opened dozens of new roles in AI product strategy, for instance. Even Amazon, after recent cuts, is recruiting for machine learning engineers and data architects. As Jack Kelly notes in Forbes, AI-driven productivity gains are enabling companies to achieve more with fewer employees, leading to a reduced demand for entry and mid-level roles. Jobs aren’t disappearing – but they are moving up the skill chain. Tech layoffs are rising — but they reveal a broader shift in where opportunity lies. Despite headlines, many parts of the job market remain active – and even booming. AI and machine learning roles continue to grow, with engineers and product managers in high demand. Cybersecurity and compliance are also thriving, particularly in finance and healthcare. Data and cloud infrastructure roles – like DevOps engineers and data analysts – are seeing consistent hiring. And consulting giants like McKinsey and Deloitte are scaling digital transformation and AI advisory teams. Even public sector and nonprofit tech teams are expanding – especially in climate, healthcare, and education tech. LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky has highlighted how jobs are evolving faster than ever, noting that “even if you’re not looking to change your job, your job is likely changing on you.” His point reflects a broader trend in the 2025 job market: the most secure careers are those that combine domain expertise with adaptability and emerging tech literacy – particularly AI. If you’re in a role that feels at risk – or just uncertain – the smartest move is to upskill in a direction the market is already heading. Take Rachel, a mid-level marketing manager affected by a recent restructure. Rather than chasing the same title, she completed a six-week prompt engineering course and began freelancing on generative AI campaigns. Within months, she landed a role leading AI content strategy at a fintech startup. Her path reflects a broader trend: roles that blend business insight with emerging tech are in high demand. If you're in marketing, explore AI content tools or data-driven growth roles. For those in operations or support, learning automation platforms or customer analytics can offer a competitive edge. HR professionals can gain traction in tech recruitment or people analytics. Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Google Career Certificates offer affordable routes into these growing areas. McKinsey’s 2024 Technology Trends Outlooksupports this shift, noting a 111% year-on-year increase in generative AI job postings and underscoring the value of “fusion” roles that pair technical fluency with business acumen. In a 2025 job market shaped by AI, your most valuable assets are adaptability and a skill set aligned with where your industry is going – not where it’s been. If you’re job hunting, don’t limit yourself to your current title. Ask yourself what parts of your role can’t be automated. Identify adjacent skills that are gaining demand. And scan for sectors still investing in talent. Because the future of work won’t belong to those who never face disruption. It will belong to those who know how to pivot through it.
