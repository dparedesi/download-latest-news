lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis. While everyone was busy reassuring themselves the stock market was still A-OK, the driver of the market--the AI fad--just burned to the waterline. Yes, the current euphoric expectations for AI are a fad, the latest in the endless stream of "gotta have" status signifiers and cultural frenzies. The core dynamic in all fads is Human Wetware 1.0. Though we glorify our individuality--The primacy of the Individual is the key characteristic of Modernity--we remain a herd animal, alert to every twitch in the herd's emotional state and anxious to join the herd when it starts running, lest we're left behind or lose status. CEOs are just as prone to fads as the rest of us, and this is how the AI fad gathered momentum. A decade ago the warm-and-fuzzy tech fad that enamored every corporate HQ was fuzzy logic, one of the long line of precursors to the current AI mania. So labels touting "fuzzy logic" were slapped on rice cookers as everyone scrambled to cash in on the latest tech fad. And so now every package of Kroika Cookies is emblazoned with "powered by AI!" Indeed. The leaders of the herd are especially keen to study every shift in the zeitgeist and the pecking order, as the greatest sin for CEOs is to be revealed as incompetent / clueless by missing the latest boat in corporate fads. Here is one example of the catastrophic consequences not of missing the boat but of blindly climbing on board. On a flight to Shanghai in May 2000, shortly after the NASDAQ dot-com bubble had peaked, my seatmate was a senior engineer working for a Silicon Valley semiconductor equipment maker. Over the course of the long flight, he recounted the domino-like chain of disastrous results of the CEO jumping on the "gotta offshore production" fad that was sweeping through Corporate America. The net result of moving production to Southeast Asia and China was 1) the wholesale theft of intellectual property (IP) and 2) the collapse of quality, requiring technicians to be flown in to fix all the quality problems. But to not move production overseas would have been perceived as "missing the boat," so everyone rushed to join the thundering herd, whether it made any sense or not. The second dynamic in play now is this: monopolies don't care about efficiency or quality, as the user / consumer has no real alternative. The tech world is brimming with stories of corporate wealth being squandered on teams developing efficiencies that are shelved upon completion. The more money gushing into the corporate coffers, the less interest there is in efficiencies. Keeping the Good Ship Status Quo on course is good enough--until the Status Quo burns to the waterline. Then the scramble is to cover the disastrous mis-allocation of corporate capital and identify the next fad to join. The third dynamic is: this isn't about one company. It's about a toolbox that's already infected the entire tech world. It doesn't matter if DeepSeek disappears tomorrow: the toolbox of software structures they've released has already entered the bloodstream of global tech and has already transformed the DNA. There's no going back to brute-force processing as any sort of competitive advantage. Rather, it's a cost anchor that will drag any denialist laggards to the bottom. The fourth dynamic is: there's nothing investable in this disruption because everyone can now develop the same open-source tools and approaches. there is no monopolistic moat to guarantee profits, and no revenue stream to milk. Rather, like deploying billions of dollars on data farms to improve search, there is no revenue at all. Nobody's paying a single dollar for AI enhanced search. As I've noted before, when the tools and techniques are freely available to all, there's no scarcity value to any of it. And with no scarcity value--no value proposition so mighty that people will pay a premium for it--then profits are thin to zero. The "smart money" has noted the AI fad has burned to the waterline, and has been frantically assuring "dumb money" that the stock market bubble is still intact and poised to bubble higher, so there's no reason to sell, and every reason to "buy the dip" so the "smart money" can sell, sell, sell near the top and let the "dumb money" absorb the coming 80% decline as a fad that was poorly conceived from the start has burned to the waterline, and the tiniest wave will send it to the bottom. The "safe bet" was on heavily moated tech behemoths dumping billions of dollars into the "competitive advantage" of energy-ravenous processing power. That "safe bet" is now in Davy Jones' Locker. The reality that "AI has no revenues and no profits" is lingering above the burned-out hulk as a haze of doubt and confusion. What's the next fad? Stay tuned. It might just be a retro revival of the time-tested fad for cost-cutting and "return to basics," starting with mass layoffs and slashing capex budgets. Sometimes wide moats and billions of dollars to blow lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis.

The company is laying off dozens of people in the department, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). “Following a recent review, we’re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in the report. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been cut at the company since Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021, according to the report. These included 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles, per the report. Jassy said in September that Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online at the time, Jassy wrote that Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organization’s ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time. It was reported Jan. 15 that tech giants Meta and Microsoft were cutting back on their headcounts, with Meta set to cut its workforce by 5% and Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its consulting business and lay off some employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that monitors job cuts in the tech sector, 545 tech companies laid off a total of 152,664 employees in 2024. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

In a note to staffers viewed by CNBC, Drew Herdener, who oversees public relations and corporate responsibility, wrote that the company is eliminating some jobs in those groups as part of a wider review into the "current org design" of the divisions. "As we examined our current org design and decided on the shifts outlined above, we identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn't solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads," Herdener wrote. "To address this and do the right thing for the business, we're eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability. This is a difficult decision to make and one that my leadership team and I do not take lightly." Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the layoffs and said in a statement that the job cuts would "help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers." Bloomberg earlier reported the job cuts. Herdener went on to say that the company may rehire some employees for roles at lower levels, "and in others, we will redistribute the headcount to other areas within the org." Amazon will provide financial support, continued benefits and job-placement assistance to laid-off staffers, Herdener said. Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company in 2022 and 2023 as part of CEO Andy Jassy's efforts to rein in costs. It had smaller rounds of job cuts in 2024 that are stretching into this year. The company has also continued to wind down some of its more experimental or unprofitable initiatives, including a "Try Before You Buy" clothing service and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery program. Herdener said Amazon is streamlining its communications and sustainability divisions after the organization "grew quite a bit" in recent years. Herdener's role expanded in recent years and he now also oversees corporate responsibility, which includes the sustainability group. Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding staffers to its corporate workforce and in its hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. Its global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company had more than 1.5 million employees as of the end of the third quarter. Amazon is also making some changes to its "hub strategy," which dictates the offices teams primarily use, as part of the reorganization, Herdener said. The goal is to have "more team members working in the same physical location as the majority of their teammates and/or manager," he wrote. Herdener said he is leaving it up to his direct reports to decide which locations make sense for their teams. Earlier this month, Amazon began requiring corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office. In a push to get employees back to the office, some staffers were told to relocate to hubs in different states. Several Amazon employees told CNBC following the announcement of the "return to hub" policy that they had chosen to leave the company instead of relocating. As part of the five-day office mandate, Amazon also set a goal to flatten its corporate structure by having fewer managers in each organization. Amazon has made sustainability a bigger directive within the company. It set ambitious climate goals in 2019, including a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2040. It also aims to power its business operations with renewable energy sources by 2025, and has amassed a portfolio of more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.

Title: Marketers Say They Are Ready To Move Beyond Google Search

Plus: UnitedMasters Brings Musicians Into The Creator Economy, CNN Layoffs Show Problems In Broadcasting, AI-Generated Media Dazzles And Baffles Search is changing and marketers say they’re ready for it. A new study from Botify found that 94% of marketing leaders say they are at least somewhat prepared to optimize brand visibility for AI search, with almost 42% saying they’re very prepared. Not only are they prepared, but they’re enthusiastic, too. Nearly two-thirds were excited by Gartner’s prediction that AI chatbots will cause a 25% drop in traditional search engine traffic by 2026, and 74% were excited by what they’ve seen so far with ChatGPT Search. While the study shows that marketers are welcoming the challenge of moving away from Google’s long dominance in basic online search, how they’re getting ready is different across the board. More than six in 10 said they’re adjusting their strategies, but what they’re adjusting for varies. The survey asked marketers what they think of when someone mentions non-Google search, and while OpenAI products got high marks—56% think of ChatGPT and 42% think of SearchGPT—many are thinking more along the lines of traditional social channels. YouTube was the most popular alternative, with just over two-thirds thinking of it, but Meta and TikTok were each considered by about 40% of respondents. (The study was conducted in December, before the TikTok ban-or-sale law was upheld or enacted.) Nearly 45% thought about e-commerce giant Amazon. While marketers have been working on their social media and e-commerce search strategies for years, there’s a steep learning curve in figuring out just what to do for generative AI marketing plans. Just over half—55%—say understanding how platforms work is a major challenge. About the same amount said they’re concerned about data privacy. And nearly half are worried about how to keep up with the pace of innovation. The good news for marketers is that there’s a lot in flux with generative AI search. Tools are being refined, algorithms are changing, systems are “learning” better answers, and different types of information are being prioritized. It’s a good time for marketers to experiment and try new things to see what works, especially since generative AI platforms are doing the same thing. And the fact that most marketers see this as an opportunity means that creative solutions are likely to come from all areas, with potential for unexpected and positive results. Technology has been changing the way things work for years. It’s had huge impacts on creators, democratizing the ability for people to create something, put it out into the world and have it make a difference. Legendary record industry executive Steve Stoute saw opportunities in technology, and harnessed its opportunity for the music industry by starting UnitedMasters in 2017. I talked to him about how UnitedMasters is augmenting the creator economy, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The CNN logo outside its Atlanta studios. Another sign of the times for traditional broadcast media: Last week, CNN cut about 6% of its workforce—about 200 employees, mainly on the broadcast side—but continued hiring for digital media jobs. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes the cuts shouldn’t have been a surprise. CNN has been losing viewership as many people change the way they look for and consume news. Benzinga reports that since the election in November, CNN has lost 47% of its primetime viewers, hitting a 30-year ratings low for the network. When the cuts were announced, CNN CEO Mark Thompson said the network will soon launch a streaming service, revamp its digital footprint and subscriber services and make changes to its lineup—and the total headcount at the news organization should be about the same when all is done. Bloom writes that Thompson has been working for about a year to figure out how to remake CNN for today’s viewer. Many other legacy networks that have seen the same types of issues—especially MSNBC and ABC News—are likely to be paying close attention. An image from László Gaál's video. A new, “speculative” commercial featuring Porsche from digital artist László Gaál is attracting a lot of attention. It tells the story of the Italian Pisano family, which has long been known in their small village for having extremely flexible necks. The reason: A neighbor of their ancestral home who loves sports cars regularly drives the latest Porsche models past the Pisanos’ balcony. The detailed story, which includes a variety of locations, a large cast and innovative camera shots, isn’t the attention-grabbing part. The entire commercial—including the vast majority of the “How I made this” behind-the-scenes interview with Gaál at the end—was AI-generated, writes Forbes contributor Roger Dooley. Gaál used Veo2 from Google DeepMind, which is still in experimental mode, to create everything except the scenes when he personally is on camera, spinning a tale of the locations, cast and crew needed for the commercial. Unlike the somewhat clunky and not-always-logical AI-generated Coca-Cola holiday commercials last year, this commercial is widely praised for its realistic feel. On a Reddit thread, Gaál said the entire commercial took about three weeks to make. The video has several disclaimers throughout that indicate it was made almost entirely by AI (and was also not actually created in conjunction with Porsche). But more obscure, low tech AI creations—known as AI slop—are increasingly proliferating on social media, often without anything to tell viewers that the images aren’t real. On Facebook, some users post over-the-top AI-generated images, sometimes daring people to believe them. They’re widely believed and accepted as real. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “loved” a viral AI-generated photo last week of a baker who created an intricate loaf of challah bread shaped like an actual-size horse, Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido writes. The photo was originally posted on a Polish satire site, and has been widely shared to show the baker’s “feat”—despite the fact that designing and baking a complex loaf of bread that size that looks so good is a nearly impossible task. And Di Placido writes Zuckerberg’s reaction could just be recognizing a well-made AI-generated image. The header photo on the centibillionaire’s own Facebook page is an AI-generated one of llamas standing on and around computer servers. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about why his business model—and the creator economy as a whole—is thriving. This conversation contains expletives, and has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. 2024 was an incredible year for UnitedMasters, especially with UnitedMasters artist FloyyMenor having the global No. 1 song on TikTok, “Gata Only.” What did you see proven with your business model last year? Stoute: When we first did this, I knew that [it would help] the mid-to-long tail artists, who probably would’ve never gotten a record deal because they couldn’t get to New York or LA, to the cities where record deals were given out, or because they took longer to develop. They would not necessarily get a deal. If we were able to give them a home, they would be able to earn a living by doing what they love. It’s being able to earn a living with doing something you love. That, I think, [is] what makes the world a better place, so that’s what I was focused on. All of a sudden, it wasn’t just for the mid-to-long tail. The big frontline artists wanted independence. They wanted to own their masses. They wanted to get the economics in their favor. And with FloyyMenor from Chile, he didn't have to go to Miami or LA or New York to get a record deal. He uploaded the song from his home and had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year, the No. 6 Spotify song of the year, a top 10 Apple Music song of the year. What that means is we’re happy. That’s another artist who got a chance to maximize their economics because of our platform. No. 2, what it shows is that the metric that the big guys use to justify success, we’re doing that too. We weren’t ever in the game that had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year. We were here to give people a platform and allow them the opportunity to do what they love and earn a living. It’s like if somebody's writing on Substack and then they’re the No. 1 published author in the New York Times. They didn’t build Substack for that. They built it for people to make a living. But if it hits that metric, then all of a sudden Penguin and all the big guys go, wait a minute. They’re playing in my game. How does the creator economy play into your business? I felt like musicians were left out of the creator economy because everyone thought the labels were handling that. The creator economy was really focused on gamers and makeup bloggers and vloggers and things like that. The music people had this thing called a record company. So that was that. The artists that did not have record deals were like: We are part of the creator economy. I think SoundCloud benefited from that. Early on, SoundCloud harbored the creator economy musicians, and then they wanted more. They didn’t want to just be on SoundCloud. They wanted distribution and opportunities. When I built UnitedMasters, I was building it not only to provide artist distribution, but we had Translation. We worked with the NBA and State Farm and AT&T and Meta, to name a few. We can not only distribute these artists, but we can do deals for them with some of these brands. The combination of being able to go to one place and get your music distributed, plus have access to brands for larger opportunities was the ecosystem I thought and I know, and is proving to be what a music company should look like going forward. From what you see, what is in store for 2025 for the creator economy as a whole? Outside of live sports, that’s where brands want to put their money. You have NFL, NBA, hockey, WNBA, and then you have the creator economy. You have podcasters and bloggers and streamers and musicians, and you’re like, how can I ring-fence that so I could measure the results within that infrastructure, and how can I protect brand safety in doing that? Brands are saying, I’m all-in for that. What the creator economy has to do is get brand ready: My shit’s together, it’s brand-friendly, it’s measurable. You can rely on us. Now you’re talking about a new medium that has money rushing towards it, that they didn’t expect to happen so fast so soon. They have to get leveled up. Major League Baseball reported it hit record revenues in 2024, with the largest one-season growth since 2015. $12.1 billion: Last year’s revenues, according to the league $1.9 billion: League and club sponsorships in 2024 ‘We’ve had a good year. Our business was strong’: MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Sportico in October, during the World Series While Bud Light’s now-infamous partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney caused fallout for the brand, not all of it was because conservative consumers were offended. The actual strategy was lacking, writes Forbes contributor Gillian Oakenfull. Here’s how to build a strategy for inclusivity campaigns so they won’t be seen as symbolic gestures, especially if they push the envelope. Storytelling is an important component of marketing, but it’s also a tool for leadership. Here are some ways to use storytelling to better connect with your team, build trust, and inspire ideas.

Feedback The job market for MBA graduates has reached a critical juncture, sparking conversations across social media and beyond. A post by CA Nitin Kaushik on X, using the handle @Finance_Bareek, captured the sentiment perfectly: “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling.” Kaushik’s post resonates with a growing number of MBA aspirants and professionals grappling with the changing realities of the job market. The issue isn’t confined to India; even graduates from elite institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are feeling the squeeze. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees: ₹25,00,000 ROI: Uncertain Research before enrolling. 🎓💡#stockmarketcrash #niftycrash #financetips #investingbehaviour The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 MBA graduates were jobless three months after graduation. This number has more than doubled since 2022 when it stood at 10%. Other top-tier schools like Stanford and Wharton have seen similar dips, with unemployment rates hovering around 20%. The issue isn’t just limited to the US. According to the International Labor Organisation’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024, 13% of the global youth labour force was unemployed in 2023—a figure representing nearly 65 million people. Why are MBAs struggling? Despite boasting median starting salaries exceeding $175,000, MBA graduates are finding it harder to land jobs due to shifting hiring practices. Consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, alongside tech giants such as Google and Amazon, have drastically reduced MBA hires amid widespread layoffs and economic slowdowns. Post-pandemic structural changes have also left companies preferring smaller, highly skilled teams. The rise of AI and automation further compounds the issue, making generalist MBA degrees less appealing compared to targeted certifications and boot camps. Kristen Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development at Harvard Business School, put it bluntly: “Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator.” Instead, companies are now focusing on technical and specialized skills. How MBA Education Needs to Evolve To address these challenges, institutions are pivoting toward innovative solutions. Harvard is testing an AI tool to match graduates with jobs and suggest courses to bridge skill gaps. Some graduates have found success by lowering their expectations and opting for less conventional roles, according to Forbes. One thing is clear—degrees alone won’t cut it anymore. The future belongs to professionals who continuously upskill to meet the ever-changing demands of the workforce. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: The Scoop: As Trump admin flexes muscle, Target retreats from DEI

Also: Proposed TikTok sale could change platform’s algorithm; RTO unfairness poses PR challenges. Also: Proposed TikTok sale could change platform’s algorithm; RTO unfairness poses PR challenges. Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Title: Playing To Win: The Pros And Cons Of Workplace Competition

Workplace competition has pros and cons. Workplace competition is inevitable in a corporate environment with an inherent pressure to outperform peers. Whether vying for promotions or bonuses, employees are in a constant race to climb the corporate ladder. Many organizations foster a competitive spirit in the hopes of driving productivity and innovation. When encouraged in the proper way, workplace competition can be beneficial. Yet, that same tactic can backfire if unhealthy rivalries result in a negative or hostile work environment. Competition in the office is more widespread than most people think. In a survey by ResumeLab, over 80% of respondents admit to experiencing workplace competition. While the majority (69.6%) describe the competition with co-workers as being healthy, just over 30% feel the competition is toxic. Co-workers who are considered healthy competition are referred to as “positive rivals.” The research revealed that employees with a positive rival are twice as likely than those with a negative rival to believe their organization creates an environment of healthy competition. Whether workplace competition results in a positive or negative experience depends on how leaders motivate employees. When competition makes employees feel excited, it can induce creative behaviors. On the other hand, if it causes workers to feel anxious and fearful, it could lead to unethical actions. Let’s review the pros and cons of workplace competition and how to create a balanced culture that generates positive outcomes. Fostering healthy workplace competition can boost employee engagement. For example, creating fun contests can help keep workers motivated. When your team feels inspired, they will work harder and be more productive. Competition also encourages people to learn new skills and go outside the scope of their roles. They feel challenged, which often contributes to greater performance. When that happens, it’s also easier for managers to identify individuals who display the leadership and initiative to be considered for promotions. Encouraging a competitive environment at work can drive creativity and team innovation. When the pressure to outperform peers builds, workers are motivated to think outside the box and strive for excellence. In a competitive workplace, the desire to innovate is constant. As a result, pursuing fresh ideas often leads to breakthroughs that might not occur in a strictly collaborative setting. Companies like Google, Amazon and Tesla are examples of organizations where workplace competition has been known to drive transformation and increase efficiency. When managed properly, workplace competition can generate higher-quality work output. The competitive environment helps guide employees to drive toward a goal. Their desire to outperform co-workers increases their focus and motivates them to pursue excellence. As teams put in more effort to impress their managers, work quality increases. If workplace competition is focused on negative outcomes, like the threat of layoffs or being publicly humiliated, it can create a toxic environment. Depending on the individual, the stress and anxiety associated with excessive competition can also breed hostility and negatively impact mental health. Finally, intense competitiveness can erode team unity as employees focus more on individual success than what will benefit the organization as a whole. When competitiveness at work results in a distrustful environment, collaboration is discouraged. Another downside is that some team members might perceive the competition as unfair, which can bring about conflicts. New employees, in particular, may feel discouraged if they think the expectations are unreasonable. When team members distrust leadership, it can result in disengagement over time. Depending on the individual, a highly competitive work environment can cause some people to act dishonestly. For example, if a sales executive is feeling the pressure to reach virtually impossible targets, they might sabotage a colleague’s work or manipulate data. When workplace competition becomes too intense, employees might even take credit for other people’s work to achieve a better performance review. Ultimately, these negative behaviors damage the company’s long-term reputation and team morale. Workplace competition can be a double-edged sword. While it sometimes motivates employees, it can also have the opposite effect. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, the determining factor is how employees respond emotionally. If they interpret their feelings as anxiety, they are more likely to behave unethically. Yet, when they feel excited, they are apt to leverage creative behaviors to problem-solve. Fundamentally, how workplace competition makes people feel plays a crucial role in how they try to succeed. By leading with a positive attitude, managers can maintain a competitive spirit that makes employees feel nurtured and valued. One Community. Many Voices.
