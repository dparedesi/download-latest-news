Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts. More of this week's top reads: VCs are in a 'frenzy' to invest in Anduril, but good luck getting ahold of shares. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: The Inconvenient Truth about H-1B Visas
URL: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-h-1b-visas/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T04:01:00Z

Americans are told that mass immigration will bring the world’s geniuses to our country. The numbers tell a different story. President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office. Now, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?” Big Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X. Ramaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.” The resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters. A Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse. Trump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process. But what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it? The H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people. At the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.) While the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies. There are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers. A permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process. Once naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program. This is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration. We've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic. Naturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program. Astonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy. That doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story. The H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.” “Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans. Speaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April. The number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S. Infosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance. It's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees. Not surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners. “I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her. While U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?” Other H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.” Again, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America. At least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented. Every year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees. Wily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave. Critics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.” Not only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example: H1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse. Then there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” There are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems. But defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year. These are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs? That's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity. Recent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs. That's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025. A jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers. “There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.” The center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes. “If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job. Immigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period. The discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether. On the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here. Sixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality. Nor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64. Even without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years. This is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)? For MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world. Hayden Ludwig is the director of policy research for Restoration of America.

To be clear, Salke’s boss, Mike Hopkins (the head of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video), praised her work in an email to employees and described her departure as one that allows the company to “flatten our leadership structure a bit” — a recurring theme in recent tech company layoffs. In other words, Amazon does not intend to fill Salke’s role. Instead, the heads of its film and TV studios will report directly to Hopkins. But the reporting around Salke’s departure highlights Amazon’s streaming disappointments and challenges under her leadership. Previously an exec at NBC, Salke joined Amazon Studios in 2018, as the company was looking to expand beyond critically praised movies and shows into more mainstream hits. The streamer has had its share of successes since then, including “Reacher,” “Jack Ryan,” “Fallout,” and “The Boys.” It also made a big bet on “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a show whose premiere drew a record audience for Amazon but has not proven to be the world-conquering phenomenon that you’d hope for with a reported budget of more than $1 billion. And then there’s “Citadel,” an espionage show designed as the epicenter of a fictional universe of global spinoffs like “Citadel: Diana” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny.” Extensive reshoots reportedly turned “Citadel” into the second most expensive show ever made (behind only “The Rings of Power”), but its reception has been even more underwhelming. The Hollywood Reporter says the second season has been delayed from fall 2025 to spring 2026, with further spinoffs put on hold. Amazon has also struggled to get another James Bond film into production, following its acquisition of MGM in 2022. Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was their father) maintained creative control of the franchise, and a Wall Street Journal report in December suggested that Barbara Broccoli was particularly unhappy with Amazon — she was apparently annoyed in an early meeting when Salke referred to Bond as “content,” and she was even reported to have described the tech giant’s team as “idiots.” Another source said that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was, in turn, so angered by the WSJ story about Broccoli that he declared, “I don’t care what it takes, get rid of her,” with the company subsequently paying Wilson and Broccoli to give up control. Salke’s name was noticeably missing from Amazon’s triumphant announcement of the Bond deal. She will, however, be starting a new film and TV production company with a first-look deal at Amazon. Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The gaming retailer paid nearly $270,000 last year for Ryan Cohen’s executive security, while the toy company laid off 120 workers at its headquarters. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From H&M’s Q1 store closures to Michelle Obama and Steph Curry partnering on a sports hydration drink, here’s our closeout for the week. Williams-Sonoma keeps it 500 Home retailer Williams-Sonoma on Monday announced the company’s inclusion in the S&P 500. “Being included in the S&P 500 is a significant milestone that acknowledges the power of our brand portfolio and growth strategies,” CEO Laura Alber said in a statement. “We remain committed to driving innovation, delivering exceptional products and experiences to our customers, and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.” The company’s portfolio includes its namesake brand, Williams Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark & Graham and GreenRow. Weaker gross margin hurts H&M’s profitability in Q1 H&M on Thursday reported first-quarter net sales increased 3% year over year to 55.3 billion Swedish Krona (about $5.5 billion). The company’s profitability during Q1 was negatively impacted by weaker gross margin that was affected by increased markdowns, customer investments and external factors, according to an earnings announcement. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 51.5% last year. CEO Daniel Ervér said it continued to “optimise the store portfolio” through store closures, 40 net of which shuttered during the quarter. “Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” Ervér said in a statement. Sally Beauty partners with Uber Eats Sally Beauty entered the Uber Eats platform on Tuesday, making its products available for delivery nationwide. This is Uber Eats first national beauty partnership and, to honor it, customers can get half off purchases $50 or more through March 31. “Being the first beauty retailer to partner with Uber Eats allows us to take convenience to the next level, further expanding our same-day delivery reach nationwide, making our quality products more accessible than ever before,” Natalie Lockhart, group vice president of strategy, customer insights and digital experience at Sally Beauty Holdings, said in a statement. Michelle Obama, Steph Curry partner to launch Plezi Hydration Plezi Nutrition, the company co-founded by former First Lady Michelle Obama, announced this week that it teamed up with NBA star Steph Curry to create a healthier sports hydration drink. "I'm excited to team up with Plezi to launch Plezii Hydration, a game-changing hydration beverage that I believe can make a real difference for anyone looking to perform at their best," Curry said in a statement. "We've created something with smart ingredients and unbeatable flavor, so people can fuel their bodies the right way. No nonsense, no shortcuts — because the next generation deserves better." Plezi said the beverage touts qualities like two-times the electrolytes, half the sugar, seven-times the potassium and less sodium compared to other sports drinks. The beverage comes in three flavors — lemon lime, tropical punch and orange mango twist — and is available in 16.9-ounce bottles for $2.29. The product is available nationwide on Amazon, as well as in California at Walmart, Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions locations. “At Plezi, we're always thinking about how we can change the game when it comes to nutrition," Obama said in a statement. “We're excited to provide a delicious, healthier option for everyone who's trying to get active and stay hydrated." 7-Eleven reintroduces an April Fool’s Day sweet treat 7-Eleven’s Mystery Donut for April Fool’s Day is returning for a limited time. The Bismark-style donut features an unknown flavor filling. Customers can take their guess at the Mystery Donut flavor at participating 7-Eleven, Speedway and Stripes locations from Tuesday through April 29. "Every April, we like to add a little mischief to our bakery offerings with the Mystery Donut as an unexpected twist that's all about surprising our customers in the spirit of April Fool's Day," Brandon Brown, senior vice president of Fresh Foods at 7-Eleven, said in a statement. "It may seem like a prank, but it's no joke!” $268,553 That’s how much GameStop paid to provide executive security services for CEO Ryan Cohen for the fiscal year ending on Feb. 1. “We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, as they enable Mr. Cohen to carry out his responsibilities,” the company wrote in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop doesn’t consider the securities to be a personal benefit or compensation paid to Cohen. 120 That’s how many employees Mattel will lay off at its headquarters, according to a March 17 notice filed in California in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The permanent layoffs are effective on May 19. Mattel did not immediately respond to Retail Dive’s requests for comment. The company said last year it was targeting $200 million in cost savings by 2026. Retailers face prolonged stretch of downbeat consumer sentiment The Conference Board said this week that its measure of consumer expectations for employment, business conditions and personal finance fell to its lowest point in 12 years and uncomfortably below the threshold that can signal a recession. Its measure of consumers’ confidence in the economy fell for the fourth straight month. This tracks with other research, including last week’s University of Michigan’s monthly consumer survey, which one economist called “a horrific report.” Much of the anxiety is fueled by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which announced auto levies earlier this week. “If there was a silver lining in [The Conference Board’s] March report, it was that consumer perceptions of the labor market held steady relative to February,” Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Jeremiah Koh said in a research note this week. “Even so, an overall theme of uncertainty is broadly setting in for the consumer, and the short term policy outlook does not portend an end to this uncertainty with new tariffs on the horizon in April.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts The intense pressure to end diversity initiatives has led companies to scrutinize their policies.

Title: International Insider: ‘No Other Land’; Series Mania Wraps; BAFTA TV Noms

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, Max Goldbart here taking you through another super busy week of news. Sign up here. ‘No Other Land‘ American Film Academy criticism: On Monday, Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham wrote in an X post that his Palestinian No Other Land co-director, Hamdan Ballal, had been attacked by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and was later detained by Israeli soldiers. The story has since moved fast. Abraham posted the next day that Ballal had been freed but was badly beaten while in custody. The 24-hour incident then sparked outcry in the film community, with strong statements from institutions including the European Film Academy. Filmmakers and actors such as Christine Vachon, Ezra Edelman, and Mark Ruffalo lent their names to public calls for Ballal’s release. The incident occurred less than a month after No Other Land won the Best Documentary Oscar, a grim fact that Abraham highlighted as he criticized the American Film Academy for “declining to publicly support” Ballal. The Academy did later send a letter to its members alluding to the incident, which Abraham posted on X and criticized for not mentioning Ballal. The American Academy rarely makes public statements about detentions or instances of violence against Academy winners, but in 2011, it did call for the release of multiple detained Iranian filmmakers, we have noted. The Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Police have denied being involved in any beating. Israeli authorities have said that Ballal was detained along with several others on suspicion of throwing stones, damaging property, and compromising the security of the area. The incident is devastating and comes as global stakeholders once again try to bring about ceasefire for a conflict that has lasted nearly 18 months.

Myself, Jesse and Stewart have spent the week in Lille taking the temperature of the global TV biz and seeing what people have to say. The vibe on the ground was cautious optimism, as creatives and producers embrace challenges with spirit. Check out our five takeaways dive deep into what people were discussing. The funding crisis in drama was front and center, although we found that this is very much not a “one size fits all” problem and some are experiencing it more acutely than others. Stewart also had a think about the future of the fest as it hits a crossroads – it has become so big now (we hear attendance this year was up 20%) that it feels as though it could comfortably swallow up the now-defunct Cannes-based MIPTV and beyond. At the same time, star power at Series Mania only rises, with the likes of Amanda Seyfried, Christina Hendricks and Pamela Adlon all out and about and seemingly having a whale of a time in northern France. What could be next for this buzzy festival? We’ll be keeping a close eye. All our coverage from the week can be found here. BAFTA Turns To Small Screen Reindeers & Horses: While the BBC will no doubt point to a 75-nom haul as evidence the corporation remains at the peak of its power, yesterday’s BAFTA TV Awards anno shone a light on a trio of the biggest British streaming hits. Baby Reindeer topped the charts with eight, followed closely by Apple TV+’s Slow Horses and Disney+’s Rivals, with big names like Gary Oldman, Jonathan Pryce (for the first time) and Richard Gadd being recognized from these shows. The noms come at a time when funding local British drama is getting harder and harder, and it was therefore satisfying to see ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office neck-and-neck with these splashy streamer hits. Speaking to us afterwards, BAFTA boss Jane Millichip warned of “choppy waters” if the drama affordability issues aren’t resolved. She also pointed out that the tonal barriers are breaking down between shows commissioned by the broadcasters and the streamers. This time next year, two Netflix breakouts that are currently tearing up the global charts yet feel very much like they could have found a home at a British broadcaster, Adolescence and Toxic Town, might be in with a shout for BAFTAs, Millichip suggested. Elsewhere, there were high-profile snubs in the form of The Day of the Jackal, Wolf Hall’s Mark Rylance and Prime Video receiving just one nomination, while there were happy surprises like the always popular Billie Piper being recognized for Netflix’s Scoop. Jake’s “snubs and surprises” deep dive can be viewed here. The awards take place May 11. Jennifer Salke Out Bond seals Jen’s fate: The first top exec change at a global streamer since 2020 happened overnight. Jennifer Salke is out over at Amazon MGM, although she will segue to a producer first-look deal at the same company. As there are already separate TV and film bosses at Amazon MGM, Salke will not be replaced, with Courtenay Valenti (film) and Vernon Sanders (TV) now reporting directly to Mike Hopkins. More restructuring is expected to follow and we are already hearing this could impact international, where Amazon has recently made layoffs and shuffled its pack. Salke’s legacy is mixed. Big hits including The Boys, Fallout and Mr. & Mrs. Smith have come during her tenure, but they have been relatively few and far between and have run concurrent with scrutiny over expensive projects like The Rings of Power and the Russos’ Citadel. Furthermore, Mike Fleming Junior writes that Salke’s “inability to mesh with the gatekeepers of the James Bond movies” might well have sealed her fate. “While her exit from the executive suites officially is being regarded as an exit by choice into a producing deal, sources in town say it is closer to a firing,” he writes. Ears to the ground over what comes next for Amazon. ‘Holy Cow’! A cheesy win: I wanted to drop what I was doing and do my best to stream Holy Cow immediately upon reading Melanie’s fab Global Breakout piece this week. Mel took us to France, where Holy Cow, the feature directorial debut of Louise Courvoisier, has drawn close to 1 million spectators locally. The movie follows a teenager raised in a farming community in the Eastern department of Jura who embarks on a mission to make a prize-winning wheel of Comté cheese in the face of a series of hard knocks. Sounds brie-liant to me. Mel writes that while Holy Cow may not seem like a crowd-pleaser or box office breakout on paper, it has managed to gross roughly $6.5M from a $2.1M (€2M) budget. The pic also won best first film at the French César awards. Check out the Breakout over here. The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: Simon Pegg movie Angels in the Asylum has stopped shooting indefinitely after running out of cash mid-way through production. 🌶️ Another: Kaley Cuoco is leading buzzy suspense TV drama Vanished alongside Sam Claflin, three-time Cesar winner Karin Viard and German actor Matthias Schweighöfer. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Our roving International Editor-At-Large brought news that Willem Dafoe has launched a program at Venice. ❌ Charged: Gérard Depardieu has been requested an 18-month suspended prison sentence following his sexual assault trial this week. 🤝 Done deal: Canada’s Bell Media has bought a majority stake in Leaving Neverland distributor Sphere Abacus. 🚪 Exiting: Fremantle Asia and Lat AM CEO Ganesh Rajaram, after 20 years. 🍿 Box office: Nancy broke the exclusive news that Pablo Larraín’s Maria has become the Chilean filmmaker’s highest grossing movie at the international box office. 💼 New job: September 5 co-producer Constanze Guttman has joined Leonine. ⛺ Fest latest: Glasgow Film Festival industry boss Samantha Andie Bennett chatted with Diana about a busy year. 👀 First footage: Of Stay Forte, which stars Judd Hirsch and Selma Blair as Israeli hostages who, after a desperate escape from the tunnel network in Gaza, tragically fall victim to friendly fire.

Title: Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight date confirmed

Time Published: 2025-03-28T11:25:38Z

Hereâs a question Iâm sure plagues most brides: is it better to go into space before or after your wedding? So much goes into planning the big day, Iâd think a lot of people would opt for waiting to play astronaut until after. But Lauren SÃ¡nchez is not most people. When others say formal winter attire, Lauren hears uncovered bustier. So naturally the noted journalist, bestselling author, pilot, entrepreneur, philanthropist, chairperson, and future Mrs. Bezos, is going the other way (as in, away from Earth), and squeezing in an aerospace flight ahead of her nuptials. Fresh off of the confirmation this week that Lauren and Jeff are marrying in Venice this summer, Blue Origin (the groomâs company) has just announced their first all-woman space mission is set to blastoff on April 14. How do we know theyâre all set to launch? Because theyâve got the official mission patch graphic! Blue Origin is ready to send several superstars to space. The launch date for the upcoming flight, which will include Katy Perry, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyá» n, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn and Lauren SÃ¡nchez, was confirmed this week. New Shepardâs NS-31 11th human flight will be Monday, April 14. It will lift off from Launch Site One in West Texas. The New Shepard launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC. Additionally, Blue Origin released the NS-31 mission patch. Per the company, a few of the key symbols embedded include: The target star symbolizes Aisha Boweâs ambition for setting big goals, passion for STEM, and commitment to inspiring future generations. The scales of justice symbolize Amanda Nguyá» nâs efforts to advocate for civil rights, break barriers, and empower everyday people to create change. The shooting star microphone represents Gayle Kingâs commitment to sharing important stories with the world. The firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy. The film reel symbolizes Kerianne Flynnâs passion for filmmaking, storytelling, and crafting beautiful narratives. Flynn the Fly, the main character in Lauren SÃ¡nchezâs bestselling childrenâs book, The Fly Who Flew to Space, is along for the ride. The story is about overcoming adversity, inspiring kids with learning differences to pursue their dreams. [From Just Jared] Real talk: how likely is it that the designer of that mission patch got paid an astronomically higher fee than anyone makes at Amazon? Also, âThe firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy,â made me chuckle. Why not just say itâs a nod to her song?! Katy was recently confirmed to be on Lauren and Jeffâs wedding guest list, as was Gayle King. So my next question is: is New Shepard NS-31 the bachelorette party? If so, I hope the invites said, âWill be out of this world!â (I know, I know, Iâm hilarious.) In all seriousness, I hope the flight runs smoothly and safely, and that all women aboard make it back in time for the weddingâ¦ and the rest of their lives. The recent spate of layoffs at Blue Origin has me worried, which probably wonât go away until after this whole unnecessary joyride once in a lifetime experience is over. And on top of that, the takeoff is in West Texas, currently battling an entirely preventable measles outbreak. The world is so fun right now.

Um… anyway, I hope they all have a lovely time in space and come back in one piece. Reply Smart&Messy says: March 28, 2025 at 7:34 am No she can’t, not without lifting her chin up weirdly. Same as Demi Moore. Both had very overdone liplifts. I observed a similar strained chin movement with Kate Hudson in Running Point, but to a lesser extent. They all look the same when they try to eat, for example, when you actually need to close your lips sometimes. Try to lift your upper lip with a finger right under your nose and try to speak or close you mouth. So noticeable. Reply StillDouchesOfCambridge says: March 28, 2025 at 7:57 am Thereâs a weird little crooked gap on the top lip, but her hair seems so healthy & soft and her lashes look great. Hope the flight goes well. Reply Kebbie says: March 28, 2025 at 8:03 am Thatâs putting it mildly lol her upper lip is completely deformed Cherry says: March 28, 2025 at 7:26 am I so, so hate this. We get to watch this dumb nonsense and at the same time see our hard-earned basic rights and decades-long fight for equality being obliterated in the course of a few years. But sure, great. Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez will go to space. Congrats. Reply Tate says: March 28, 2025 at 7:31 am Itâs all so gross. Reply Kitten says: March 28, 2025 at 8:52 am This is what weirdo rich people enjoy doing. Wish they’d take a few more billionaires with them TBH.

This is fake go girl feminism while Bezos censors the Washington Post and cozies up to the Trump administration that is dismantling the government and our rights. If Trump says anything negative about this flight, wouldnât be surprised if Bezos cancels it. Reply Traveller says: March 29, 2025 at 10:59 am Exactly this. Incredibly bad optics for all involved – Cozying up to a trump ass-kissing oligarch while the U.S. slides further and further into the fascist abyss. I guess as long as nothing will affect them why should they be worried about the rest of the country. Deering24 says: March 28, 2025 at 9:38 pm Very Gilded Ageâthe rich show off/fund achievements while the rest of us are kicked down to ladderâs bottom, where we should applaud them. Reply Smart&Messy says: March 28, 2025 at 7:30 am I hope she consulted her plastic surgeon before signing up. I’d be wary of any physical impact even on a simple commercial flight with that amount of implants, fillers, threads, nips and tucks.

I thought she was so beautiful. Then she left to be an ‘actress’. I guess she did what many women of beauty do. When you don’t succeed in your career. You marry rich, then richer. Lordy what she has done to her face and body should be a crime trying to cling to youth. When one Jocelyn Wildenstein dies another rises in her place. Mslove says: March 28, 2025 at 7:53 am I’m getting OceanGate Titan vibes. Yeah, I know they’re going in the opposite direction. I would never go to space before my wedding, especially if my greedy fiancee were in charge of the rocket ship. Because if he’s having second thoughts, well, you never know.

Reply Veronica S. says: March 29, 2025 at 7:12 pm I love that Sanchez looks worse every time we see her lol. I just want to know if, in their world, it’s so normalized people can’t see it, or is she the one people whisper and nudge each other about at parties? Laughing forever at how much Katy Perry clearly wants to be a Republican, though. She’s just chomping at the bit waiting for it to socially acceptable again for a major pop star to be MAGA. With the way the SM propaganda machine is working on the young people, she may not have to wait long, I suppose. Reply Commenting Guidelines Read the article before commenting.

Title: Rolling Consumer Boycotts Stalk Amazon, Target And Tesla
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dearbeawalker/2025/03/28/rolling-consumer-boycotts-stalk-amazon-target-and-tesla/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T11:00:00Z

ByDeArbea Walker ByDeArbea Walker Forbes Staff. Consumers are organizing "#TeslaTakedown" protests online to show their anger toward CEO Elon Musk. Consumer activists have launched rolling economic boycotts of Target, Amazon and other recognizable companies in recent weeks to protest DEI rollbacks and policies seemingly aimed at appeasing the Trump administration. The outcome of these campaigns hinges on how deeply the companies feel their effects and whether consumers can find suitable alternatives. The People's Union USA, a consumer advocacy group organizing many of the boycotts, has set its sights this week on Nestlé, for what the group's founder John Schwarz says is the company's failure to address allegations of toxic ingredients and unethical business practices. This action follows calls to boycott retailers Amazon and Target for rollbacks to their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Nestlé did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, anger toward the electric vehicle maker Tesla has boiled over as public antipathy toward its CEO, Elon Musk, seems to have grown since he became the Trump administration's chief cost-cutter. These consumer initiatives may indicate the start of a "Great Rejection," which is gaining momentum online to stop spending on nonessential goods, Greg Petro, Forbes Investing contributor, says. “Whether or not a recession is in the cards this year, the evidence is clear that frustration stalks the retail aisles,” Petro writes. Consumers don’t stop spending altogether during boycotts, opening up opportunities for small businesses to attract new customers looking for alternatives, Forbes entrepreneurs contributor Allyson Kapin writes. “Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection — a re-allocation — of spending power,” Kapin says. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Black and Latino consumer groups have avoided Target and Walmart, noting the retailers' announced rollbacks of their DEI policies late last year. During The People’s Union USA’s Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, Target saw a 9% drop in foot traffic and a 14% drop in web traffic, according to Similarweb. “For now, at least in the short term, it seems that these boycotts are having an effect, but the question is how long it will last,” Forbes contributor Doug Melville writes. Black activists are focusing on Target because they see the company's about-face on DEI frustrating after its outspokenness during the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020, Pam Danziger, a Forbes retail contributor writes. Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, had committed to purchasing $2 billion worth of goods from Black businesses by the end of 2025. And the retailer promised to increase its Black workforce by 20% and pledged to establish an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee. “Target seems to be particularly vulnerable,” Danziger writes, noting the company was seen as "a high-profile partner in the diversity, equity and inclusion movement, only to be perceived as abandoning the cause.” "We would expect some loyalty, some decency and some camaraderie,” Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and lead voice of the 40-day economic boycott, told CNN. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Target declined to comment but pointed Forbes to a statement it released in January, when it announced rollbacks of DEI initiatives. It reads in part: “We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion.” Target has been one of the most visible brands to raise the ire of consumer activists, and the retailer may face its biggest test this week when stores offer up to 40% off for Circle Week — slated to go head-to-head with Amazon’s Prime Week. Data from the sales "should be able to paint a better picture of these consumer efforts," Melville says. Amazon, which was the subject of a week-long boycott earlier this month, has shown some resilience, according to Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters. The e-commerce giant saw a 6% uptick in traffic from the previous eight weeks when The People’s Union USA boycotted March 7 to 14, according to Momentum Commerce. Before the Amazon boycott, 9% of shoppers planned to participate, but when the time came, the data showed a different story, according to Masters. “The disparity between stated boycott intentions and sales impact underscores a well-documented gap between what consumers say they’ll do and what they actually do,” Masters says. With consumers participating in a variety of boycotts and protests, small businesses wonder if there will be an opportunity for them to win customers. The grocery space offers some insights. Since 2020, consumer spending at farmers’ markets has increased more than 20%, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. Consumers seem to be gravitating to farmers' markets looking for more locally sourced and safer food options, Stephanie Gravalese, a Forbes dining contributor writes. “If the blackout encourages even a fraction of participants to shift toward local alternatives, it could reinforce an existing movement prioritizing small food businesses over corporate chains — a shift that may already be underway,” Gravalese writes. However, while consumers look for non-corporate options for everyday goods, many fear a complete drop-off in consumer spending in response to the boycotts. Inflation, perhaps stiffened by tariffs, and uncertainty over the future of the labor market have left consumers feeling uneasy. Last month, consumer confidence dropped seven points to its lowest level since 2021, according to The Conference Board, a nonpartisan think tank. “While the Great Rejection is not a real thing yet, it is an idea that consumers are warming to — spend less and save more — that could be with us for some time to come,” Petro writes. Even with boycotts planned through the summer, Shelley Kohan, a Forbes retail contributor, writes that the biggest question is how can consumers voice their fury without tanking the economy. While the boycotts aim “to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake,” Kohan says. Tesla sales have been down worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Europe. It's not just DEI cuts that have some consumers upset. The #Teslatakedown social media campaign targets Tesla, one of the largest and most recognizable electric car makers, led by Musk. “Every action he makes is met with an equal reaction online, often with the hashtag,” Peter Suciu, a Forbes social media contributor writes of Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man and the CEO of SpaceX, Starlink, X and Tesla, has been one of the most visible and prolific fundraisers and supporters of President Trump and backed far-right political parties in the U.K. and Germany. With Trump's blessing, Musk has overseen mass layoffs and spending cuts across the federal government in his role as head of the Department Of Government Efficiency. Musk has defended DOGE, saying that the project, aimed at cutting up to $2 trillion in government money, is addressing what he sees as widespread fraud in federal spending. However, Musk has been met with fierce backlash from the public, especially as he’s turned his attention to popular programs like Medicaid and Social Security. “Stealing from Social Security is not easy,” Forbes senior contributor Howard Gleckman writes. “The agency tracks employment and payroll tax payments for all workers with a Social Security number and automatically calculates old age benefits. It is very hard to game that system.” “The real risk," Gleckman says: "Trump Administration efforts to fire thousands of Social Security employees will reduce their ability to catch fraud.” Consumer dissatisfaction with Musk has already slowed Tesla's growth. Since late last year, sales have decreased worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Germany — down 76%. The company's share price has also fallen 43% since Inauguration Day, and more than $650 billion has been wiped from the company's valuation. Musk's fortune has shrunk $104 billion, according to Forbes' wealth estimates. “There are several reasons for Tesla's poor results, such as the changeover of the Model Y, falling Model 3 sales and stronger competition from rival EVs," Peter Lyon, a Forbes cars and bikes contributor writes. "Industry analysts have also put some blame for Tesla’s slump in Germany on local dissent at Musk's interference in local elections and support of the far-right AfD party.” Protests against Musk and Tesla have taken different forms: While some Tesla owners have joined consumer activism efforts by trading in their vehicles, other protests have included vandalism. How much retailers will feel the effects of consumer boycotts is still unknown, and whether or not shoppers will find lasting alternatives to the retail giants remains to be seen. “Given the increasing political divide in the country, politics is infiltrating many non-political dimensions of life, like shopping,” Danziger says. The key for retailers, big and small, may be to proceed cautiously. Kapin points out that small businesses may have opportunities while shoppers are frustrated with the big retailers. But in some ways, all retailers’ prospects are linked. “The tension between consumer activism and economic reality sits at the heart of this economic blackout debate,” Kohan writes. “While The People’s Union USA’s campaign aims to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake.”

Title: Tech has a new power base in DC

Time Published: 2025-03-28T09:00:01Z

Washington, DC, investors have long hoped to make the capital a tech startup hub. In Trump's second term, those ambitions are finally taking hold. The new presidential administration has brought a number of Silicon Valley heavyweights to Washinton. Big names in tech and venture capital like Tesla's Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz's Scott Kupor now hold positions in the federal government, while other Big Tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are spending more time in Washington, hoping to exert their influence on new tech policies. Washington is already seeing rising VC interest — the top-tier venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst have opened offices in the area in the past year, and hot defense tech startups with significant DC footprints, such as Anduril, are landing more checks and contracts. Just last week, A16z hosted an "American Dynamism" conference in Washington, with opening remarks by Vice President JD Vance. "It's time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests of the United States of America writ large," Vance said at the summit. Now, Washington is welcoming a wave of tech elites, many with backgrounds in startups and VC, that are "startup curious," said James Barlia, the executive director of the startup incubator Station DC. "There's a new power base that's forming in DC, and it's creating a real opportunity for founders," he said. Paige Soya, a managing partner at K St Capital, a local VC firm and angel syndicate, said the arrival of the tech aristocracy, along with other affluent officials in Trump's administration, is driving a real estate rush for luxury multimillion-dollar properties in the district — and bringing the potential for those elites to angel invest in local startups. "A lot of these people would have never thought of DC as a place to find good deals. But because they're here, they're organically starting to see it. I think that's going to impact funding on its own," she said. Barlia is optimistic that tech's elevated presence in the district will do more than bring money to the DC startup community: It could inject Washington with a dose of Silicon Valley's culture of disruption. "I feel like there's now deeper connectivity between Silicon Valley and DC, including ideologically and philosophically," he said. In the past year, as AI took over Silicon Valley and Trump effused a pro-tech, anti-AI-regulation stance during his presidential campaign, several powerful VCs emerged to support Trump's administration. Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Founder's Fund, posted on X after Trump chose Vance as his running mate, '"IT'S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY." Their exuberance brings new momentum to DC's tech ecosystem, which has been steadily growing as startups seek government contracts and influence on Capitol Hill. The district now boasts the fifth-most-developed VC ecosystem in the US, according to PitchBook, despite being the country's 23rd-largest city, per 2022 Census data. Tech giants like Palantir, which runs an office in Georgetown, and Microsoft, which has offices in Washington's Mt. Vernon Square and across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, have helped draw in tech and investment talent over time. Now, VC firms like A16z and General Catalyst aren't the only ones interested in the DMV's startup scene — the district itself is now betting on area startups. Mayor Muriel Bowser launched DC's first Venture Capital Program in December, with $26 million to invest in early-stage DC startups. Soya's K St Capital was picked to manage the funds. Every dollar of public funding has to be matched by private funding, Soya noted, so DC startups could receive up to $52 million through the program. K St Capital has been building its DC firm for over a decade alongside other early-stage investors such as Saas Ventures, founded in 2017. Newer projects such as District Angels launched last year to pool local angel investors to back DC startups. However, while the Trump administration has forged a newfound alliance with the tech industry, the Department of Government Efficiency's slew of cuts to federal agencies could threaten the industry's growth in Washinton. The district's chief financial officer has estimated that the layoffs could cost DC more than 40,000 jobs over the next four years. But Barlia said he thinks Elon Musk's much-criticized push to "trim the fat" in the federal government will make Washington stronger. "Elon's approach may make some people uncomfortable, but the underlying problem is undeniable. Yes, there's near-term disruption — RIFs and potential economic contraction — but in the long run, it should push DC to build a more resilient, opportunity-rich economy," he said. "That won't come from more government or big corporate jobs, but by embracing new ideas, startups, and innovation." Washington is, first and foremost, a government town, with an inherent federal bureaucracy that's at odds with many startups' "move fast and break things" ethos, said John Doyle, a former Palantir executive and the founder of the defense startup Cape. Still, Doyle and Barlia said they're seeing interest from federal agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, to work with startups and move fast — faster than is typical of the government, at least. Chris Morales, a Point72 Ventures defense tech partner who's based in DC, pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's March memo about the DoD's plans to modernize how it acquires software and contracts with companies. Morales said the memo is one of multiple signs his firm is seeing that the agency is getting more serious about tech innovation. While Soya and Barlia said they're seeing startups across various industries gain traction in Washington, defense tech easily remains the hottest among them. Cape landed its first contract with the Department of Defense in 2023 in a deal to provide its cybersecurity-focused mobile carrier services to Naval forces in Guam after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group targeted the base's tech infrastructure. Cape has since raised $61 million in financing rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz and A*, announced in April 2024. Doyle said part of the reason Cape picked DC as its headquarters was to rub shoulders with the federal agencies it hoped to partner with. As he said, "proximity matters." It's no surprise then that a number of defense tech startups have opened offices in Washington, including Anduril, which recently raised $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation in August, and Shield AI, which raised $240 million this month in a funding round that valued the autonomous drone maker at $5.3 billion. Startups in the DMV can also tap into the area's hard tech talent, which could help continue to boost the area's presence as a tech hub. Northern Virginia hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of data centers. Amazon opened its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, in 2023. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, have outposts in the area. And many of the country's largest aerospace and defense companies, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are headquartered in the DMV. Doyle said the DMV's deep bench of technical expertise has helped Cape find numerous backend engineers in the area. He admitted, though, that Washington has a smaller candidate pool than traditional tech hubs like San Francisco and New York City. Cape also has a New York office, for which Doyle said it's generally easier to source talent, especially front-end engineers and designers. As some VCs flock to the DC area, others are fleeing. Sequoia Capital plans to shutter its DC office at the end of March and cut its policy team there, despite other major VC firms moving in. A Sequoia spokesperson told BI that the firm built its policy team in DC to strengthen its connections and its portfolio companies' connections with policymakers and other experts. The policy team set Sequoia up favorably to carry those relationships forward in the US and Europe, the spokesperson said. Khosla Ventures managing director Keith Rabois said at a conference in February that Washington "definitely still is not where early-stage venture capitalists should be spending too much time," despite saying he'd recently run into Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the city. DC's venture scene may not yet rival San Francisco's, but it's feeling fresh momentum nonetheless. A16z's American Dynamism Summit largely set out to connect San Francisco's VC ecosystem with Washington policymakers, but DC-based investors were also in attendance this year, said Jonathan Lacoste, a general partner at Austin-based Space VC, who attended the conference. "There were plenty of investors at the event, not just from the West Coast, but increasingly from DC's venture landscape too," he told BI. As DC's tech community grows, so does its appetite for more networking opportunities. Catherine McMillan, an analyst at the tech-focused consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, founded the DC chapter of the GenAI Collective, a generative AI networking nonprofit started in San Francisco in 2023. McMillan also helps run two other tech communities in the district: DC Tech Parties and She's In Tech. McMillan's DC chapter of the GenAI collective now has 700 members, with each event bringing in fresh faces. "It's an undervalued tech market because it doesn't have the same level of visibility that SF or New York have. That's part of what I'm trying to do, shed a light on the cool entrepreneurial things that are happening in the DMV," she said. "We have a Big Tech presence, but we also have an ecosystem in its own right." Jump to

Title: A millennial making $280,000 secretly working 2 remote jobs said it's important to get in a rhythm: 'Burnout is real'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/two-remote-jobs-paying-280k-avoid-burnout-stay-organized-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-28T07:09:01Z
Full Content:
After getting laid off four times in four years, Reed was desperate for some level of job security. So he decided to try working two full-time jobs simultaneously. In March 2020, Reed, who's in his 30s and living in New York, was laid off from his strategic operations job in the tech industry. It took him six months to start a new job, but layoffs struck again. His next job lasted less than a month because of the company's financial hardships. By December 2023, he'd lost his fourth job in just over three years. "It was easy to get the jobs because there were jobs out there, but it was hard to keep them," said Reed, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing a fear of professional repercussions. From 2020 to 2023, more than 800,000 tech industry employees across the globe were laid off, according to TrueUp's layoff tracker. Reed said that after the fourth layoff, he had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. This year, Reed is on track to earn about $280,000 secretly working two full-time remote jobs, which pay about $175,000 and $150,000 respectively. With the additional income, he said, he supports his partner — who has been unemployed for three years — helps his parents pay their monthly mortgage, and assists his niece and nephew with their college tuition. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner so we can stay in our apartment and still save money, and do all those adult things that I'm responsible for financially," he said. "I don't really have a choice." Reed is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple remote jobs to boost their incomes. Over the past two years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra earnings to travel the world, buy weight-loss drugs, or simply pay the bills. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. But many job jugglers have told BI the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. After his fourth layoff, Reed started applying for remote jobs, intending to accept two full-time offers if he could get them. In March 2024, he landed his first job. He said looking for another role — between all the applications and interviews — sometimes felt like a second job. In December, he finally achieved his goal and began job juggling for the first time. During his job search, Reed tried to prioritize employers that seemed committed to remote work, but this didn't always go according to plan. Around early September of last year, Reed finished the interview process for a remote position at Amazon. But soon after he'd finished interviewing, Amazon announced that many corporate employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in January. When Reed received a job offer for the role, it was no longer remote: He'd be required to work full time from the nearest office, which he said was about 30 to 40 minutes away. He decided to decline the offer and, in December, accepted a remote position with another company. While other companies have also announced return-to-office policies, Reed feels confident his two current jobs will remain remote. To his knowledge, neither company has ever had a mandatory in-office policy. Reed's typical workweek is about 60 hours, he said, but he does some of his work in the evenings and on weekends. He said that while juggling two jobs could be very stressful at times, he'd found some ways to manage this stress. He gets up earlier than he needs to so he can prepare for the workday ahead, but he still makes sure to get enough sleep — he said it's easier to manage stress when he's well-rested. Additionally, rather than switching between his two work laptops every few minutes, Reed tries to focus on one job for an extended period of time before pivoting to the other. "I have to take breaks in the middle of the day to be able to decipher between one of the two jobs because it does get a little overwhelming," he said. Reed said he has an advantage that many job jugglers don't have: He generally doesn't have to worry about having two meetings scheduled at the same time. That's because he usually schedules the meetings he has to attend. He said he blocks off his meeting times for one job on the other job's calendar, which helps him reduce his chances of getting double-booked. "It has been way more manageable than I thought it was going to be," he said of job juggling. "If you can get into a rhythm of how it works and get organized with how you do the work, it's totally possible to do." Reed said that over the past couple of years, it had taken him longer to land job offers. He thinks this is because many of the remote roles he's applied for have hundreds of applicants — and the interview process has become more extensive. "I used to be able to do two, three interviews max and you would get an offer," he said. "Now it's like a hiring screen, a take-home test, a panel, you have to do a presentation — there are like six or seven steps." Looking ahead, Reed said he had no plans to stop job juggling. He doesn't think it's sustainable long-term, but with his partner still looking for work, he can't afford to stop now. "For now, I'm giving myself a three-to-five-year window," he said. "Because burnout is real. It's going to happen eventually." ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Title: 'MBA is costliest course for teaching nothing': Consultant drops a brutal truth bomb

Feedback A senior manager at a consultancy firm, Manab Majumdar, dropped a provocative reality check about MBAs, stirring significant debate on LinkedIn: "MBA is the costliest course for teaching nothing. Yes, you can learn every subject taught in an MBA at 1/100 cost." The blunt assessment arrives amidst a rapidly shifting job market where traditional assumptions about MBA programs are being dismantled. Majumdar didn't stop there, adding, "Post MBA, you don't become the CXO of the company. Bollywood ka movie dekh k MBA wala fantasy jo hain, wo galat hain." Indeed, dreams of instant executive roles after graduation are increasingly proving unrealistic. CA Nitin Kaushik (@Finance_Bareek) on X echoed this sentiment sharply: "𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling." Even premier institutions like Harvard aren't insulated. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted an unsettling statistic: 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 graduates were unemployed three months after graduation, a dramatic increase from 10% just two years earlier. Stanford and Wharton, too, have reported similar declines, with unemployment nearing 20%. Globally, the picture isn't brighter. According to the International Labour Organization, youth unemployment stood at an alarming 13% in 2023, affecting approximately 65 million young individuals worldwide. Why are MBAs struggling despite attractive median starting salaries exceeding $175,000? The answer lies partly in evolving corporate strategies. Firms like McKinsey, BCG, Google, and Amazon have sharply curtailed MBA hiring amid economic downturns and layoffs. Simultaneously, the corporate world is shifting toward smaller, specialized teams, boosted by the rise of AI and automation, making generalized MBA skills less relevant. Kristen Fitzpatrick, head of career development at Harvard Business School, starkly observes, "Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator." Instead, specialized technical skills are increasingly coveted. In response, business schools are pivoting rapidly. Harvard is now experimenting with AI-powered tools designed to match students to jobs and suggest tailored courses to bridge skills gaps. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Photo Credit: Crystal Dynamics The next Tomb Raider game will continue the story of Lara Croft Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced layoffs, calling the move “necessary” for its future success. As many as 17 staff members will be let go as part of the layoffs. The studio, currently working on the next Tomb Raider title, said the job cuts would not affect its plans for its current projects. In addition to the action-adventure franchise, Crystal Dynamics is also co-developing the Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox. “This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members,” the studio said in a statement on Thursday. “We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.” The studio said it would support affected employees with transition packages and opportunity outreach. “Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans,” it added. This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members.

This year, Warner Bros. announced it was shutting down three of its studios and cancelling a AAA game. Studios like NetEase, Striking Distance Studios, Crytek, BioWare, among others, have been hit with layoffs in 2025, as well. Crystal Dynamics has been working on the next Tomb Raider game, which is set to be published by Amazon Games. The studio had been “fairly sheltered” from the turmoil at its parent company, Embracer Group, Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann had said in August last year. Embracer bought Crystal Dynamics from Square Enix in 2022, but the Swedish conglomerate fell in debt after a $2 billion (roughly Rs. 16,783 crore) investment deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group collapsed, sparking a share price drop, mass layoffs at the company and its many subsidiaries, studio closures, cancellation of multiple in-development projects and eventual sale of several studios within its portfolio. Embracer sold Gearbox to Take-Two, divested Saber Interactive, but held on to Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider IP. Crystal Dynamics has not shared details about the next Tomb Raider, but the game is in the early stages of development. The untitled Tomb Raider title, however, is confirmed to be a single-player, narrative-driven adventure that continues Lara Croft's story in the series.

Almost two years ago, the studio made similar reassurances about Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark not being disrupted after the massive Embracer Group layoffs and developer closures in 2023. Just over a year ago, Lara Croft's new "unified" design was shown off for the heroine's next game, which will be published by Amazon. There is also a Prime Video TV series in the works for Tomb Raider, but it won't be connected to the game. Crystal Dynamics is also co-developing Perfect Dark with The Initiative for Xbox Game Studios. The game starring Joanna Dark got its first gameplay trailer last summer, but it still doesn't have a release window. Most recently, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered came out on PC and consoles last month. Crystal Dynamics worked with Aspyr on the remastered bundle. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Crystal Dynamics, the studio known for its share of modern Tomb Raider titles, is the latest video game developer to get hit by layoffs. The company revealed today that 17 members from its team have been let go to "better align" with its business requirements. The announcement arrived via a social media post. "This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members," said the company. "We did not make this decision lightly." As its primary internal project, the company is said to be building its next-generation Tomb Raider experience. Lara Croft is set to return in an Amazon Games-published title. While not many details have been revealed yet, the game will be single-player, focusing on a fresh storyline that continues from Crystal Dynamics' previous Tomb Raider 'Survivor Trilogy'. It's being developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5. "We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected," Crystal Dynamics added regarding today's layoffs. "We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." Alongside the next Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is also a co-developer of Perfect Dark, the upcoming single-player spy-thriller experience comes from Xbox's first-party studio, The Initiative. The title's first gameplay trailer landed last year, showing off the reboot of the classic franchise in full and revealing an immersive sim-like direction. Perfect Dark also doesn't have a release date attached to it yet. The studio added today that the latest layoffs will not affect its current project plans, saying that it "remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games."

"We did not make this decision lightly." Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced a number of layoffs, calling it a "difficult decision". 17 "talented" staff have been affected by today's layoffs, the studio shared in a statement, though it's unclear which teams they are from. "Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected," Crystal Dynamics wrote. "We recognise how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." The studio "remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games", it said, adding today's layoffs will not alter its current project plans. Crystal Dynamics is currently working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider series. Little is known about the upcoming game, which is being developed alongside Amazon. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since that time. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is being made in Unreal Engine 5 and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

Title: Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark devs Crystal Dynamics cut staff, promising that current projects are unaffected

17 people let go, including a senior combat designer Tomb Raider, Soul Reaver and Perfect Dark developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to a social media statement, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans." It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by this Xitter post, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.) Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. "Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," wrote Graham last year. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year." Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is being published by Amazon Games, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry layoffs since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures. Embracer announced plans last year to split themselves three ways in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises. Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.

Hurun Global Rich List 2025: The Hurun Global Rich List for 2025 is out and Tesla-SpaceX owner Elon Musk has retained his number one spot. Meanwhile, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has slipped out of the top 10. Notably, he still retains the top spot in Asia.

Notably, the majority top 10 comprised American businessmen and investors including long-time rich list resident Bill Gates. Silicon Valley billionaires dominated the top 10, with Americans businessmen taking up nine spots on the chart with the exception of French fashion conglomerate LVMH owner Bernard Arnault. For Elon Musk, he has managed to retain the top spot despite trouble with sales numbers and share price amid protest against his political involvement with the Donald Trump administration. Elon Musk has undertaken cuts to federal spending and directed mass layoffs, which has led to protests against his companies, including Tesla. According to the Hurun 2025 report, the top 10 of the Hurun Global Rich List added as much as $512 billion wealth during the year. This is 30 per cent of all the new wealth generated, they also comprise 12 per cent of the wealth held by the total Hurun Global Rich List 2025.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Lays Off 17 Team Members

In a post on X, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 & 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future. The full statement reads as follows below: This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected. We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach. Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans. As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively. Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As The Initiative is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a Creative Director on Perfect Dark. The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, Embracer Group, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries. Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics has only seen 27 layoffs in a total of three years, while some companies have experienced closures, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse. Already this year, there have been an estimated 1,493 employees laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.

Title: 5 years after Avengers, 2 years after its last layoffs, and who knows how long before Perfect Dark and Tomb Raider return, Crystal Dynamics announces another round of layoffs

The news "does not alter our current project plans" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Crystal Dynamics, the storied studio that's co-developing Perfect Dark and remains at work on an as-yet-untitled Tomb Raider game, has announced another round of layoffs affecting 17 employees. "This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members," the company says in a statement posted to social media. "We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected. We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." The company adds that this news "does not alter our current project plans." In 2023, Crystal Dynamics announced that it was laying off nine employees in its brand and marketing division, and one from IT, which came while its parent company, Embracer Group, was making thousands of layoffs across its vast holdings. Crystal Dynamics had some input on the recent Tomb Raider remasters, but its last major release was Marvel's Avengers in 2020. Avengers was, of course, among the many games that Crystal Dynamics' then-owner Square Enix had found to be not "as successful as we would have liked," and the studio was acquired by Embracer Group in 2022. Now, under Embracer, Crystal Dynamics is co-developing Perfect Dark alongside The Initiative at Xbox, and working on an untitled Tomb Raider game that will be published by Amazon. Last year, Amazon's gaming boss said Crystal Dynamics was "fairly sheltered" from the wider chaos at Embracer, but while 27 layoffs over the course of three years pales in comparison to the worst mass firings we've seen the game industry, it seems that shelter only goes so far.

Title: This is catastrophic’: Seattle payroll tax revenues $47M short as jobs leave city

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/26/2025 5:14:01 AM PDT by george76 Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell released his payroll expense tax (PET) report for 2024 Tuesday, and its projections came up nearly $50 million short. “Today’s announcement that PET revenues collected in 2024 were $47 million lower than projected requires action to ensure our budget remains balanced,” Harrell explained in a statement. Harrell said that his 2025 budget proposal was based on the projections from the independent Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts. But since they got it wrong, the mayor said for the 2026 budget, “my office will consider all options, including additional revenue sources and appropriate expense reductions, to ensure we are making the priority investments and funding the essential services that matter to our residents.” Did the payroll expense tax push jobs out of Seattle? The payroll tax is levied on large corporations in the city, like Amazon and Expedia. Such a steep revenue forecast error suggests high-paying companies or their jobs are leaving the city. It’s precisely why KTTH host Jason Rantz called the news “catastrophic” in a thread on X. “What people haven’t realized yet—but soon will—is that the sharp drop in payroll expense tax revenue means jobs are leaving Seattle,” Rantz explained. “The whole point of the PET was to squeeze ‘free’ money out of businesses because the city arrogantly assumed it held all the cards. But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Harrell said that his 2025 budget proposal was based on the projections from the independent Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts. But since they got it wrong, the mayor said for the 2026 budget, “my office will consider all options, including additional revenue sources and appropriate expense reductions, to ensure we are making the priority investments and funding the essential services that matter to our residents.” Did the payroll expense tax push jobs out of Seattle? The payroll tax is levied on large corporations in the city, like Amazon and Expedia. Such a steep revenue forecast error suggests high-paying companies or their jobs are leaving the city. It’s precisely why KTTH host Jason Rantz called the news “catastrophic” in a thread on X. “What people haven’t realized yet—but soon will—is that the sharp drop in payroll expense tax revenue means jobs are leaving Seattle,” Rantz explained. “The whole point of the PET was to squeeze ‘free’ money out of businesses because the city arrogantly assumed it held all the cards. But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

But what did PET actually do? It pushed Amazon jobs to Bellevue, kept employees working from home (and out of Seattle), and helped fuel layoffs at companies hit hardest by the tax—like Expedia.” Jobs are leaving Seattle Even Harrell acknowledged, “This decrease in revenue is aligned with recent reports of major employers moving thousands of high-paying jobs out of Seattle to other cities in our region.” “Large corporations should pay their fair share and we should be wary when they use job placements to avoid paying funding that our communities rely on, but we also must recognize businesses will make choices based on their bottom line,” Harrell wrote in his statement. “We need to design our tax policies with the full context of our economy and a comprehensive view that ensures we raise the revenue needed to support all of our residents in a progressive way, aligned with our values.” Rantz called Harrell’s response “strategically naïve.” “Businesses pay far more than their fair share and offer Seattleites high salaries that the city uses on wasteful, ineffective programs,” Rantz explained. “Harrell knows big business already pays ‘their fair share’ but offers his silly quote to try to villainize them, while lionizing his own efforts to go after the businesses he pretends are greedy. But he’s the greedy one: he wants more money that he didn’t earn so he can continue to misspend it. And he’ll target businesses as greedy or deceitful so it can help his re-election campaign.” He noted that the Seattle payroll tax idea may go statewide with the budget proposal from Washington Democrats. What’s next? Republican State Rep. Chris Corry of Yakima took notice of the payroll woes in Seattle. He posted, “Paging literally everyone in Olympia.” Not everyone sees this as “catastrophic,” though. KIRO Newsradio Political Analyst Matt Markovich says the revenue drop is “concerning,” but notes that the $47 million can be made up in the next budget cycle.

Title: The outlook for ad tech M&A in 2025
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/the-outlook-for-ad-tech-ma-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-03-26T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
According to LUMA Partners’ 2024 Full Year Market Report, the digital media and marketing ecosystem experienced a 13% annual increase in overall mergers and acquisitions compared to the previous year. Specifically, the ad tech sector saw a notable 73% rise in deal volume during this period, and per the Q1 deal flow this year, that trend looks set to continue. Some have even tipped a return of initial public offerings in the space in 2025. But what kind of mergers and acquisitions will keep corporate development execs busy in the coming months: distressed exits or frothy returns, and who will be in market? As of March 2025, several notable M&A deals have been made in the ad tech sector since the start of the year, with strategic players helping to swell the ranks of potential ad tech acquirers. Notable deals during the period include Publicis Groupe’s purchase of Lotame and T-Mobile’s activity, which marked a return of telcos in the space. Even noted M&A outlier The Trade Desk wrote a check for Sincera, building on the Q4 trend of strategic ad tech players entering the market, as exemplified by MediaOcean’s purchase of Innovid and Experian’s purchase of Audigent. A further sign of a return to the halcyon days of ad tech, i.e., 2021 or the mid-2010s, was MNTN’s announcement of its intention to IPO in its S-1 filing. However, sources approached by Digiday suggested any such move could be an anomaly, with LUMA Partners’ CEO, Terence Kawaja, observing that not all such filings will result in IPOs. “I’m not banking on an IPO market [similar to 2021],” he said, adding his observation that “the industry is healthier now” than at the beginning of the decade. When quizzed on which constituency would drive deal volume in the coming months, he noted how “the preponderance of dialog has been driven by strategics; with private equity, that tends to be more correlated to interest rates.” Stephen Masters of GTCR — a PE firm that purchased demand-side platform Simpli.fi in 2017 and later sold a stake to Blackstone in a 2021 in a deal valuing the ad tech firm at $1.5 billion — explained how it is important to consider the market dynamics of the mid-to-late 2010s when contemplating the contemporary landscape. “There were a couple of [ad tech] failures on the public markets around 2015… and that experience meant there were relatively underappreciated assets in the late 2010s, despite really strong growth, that created a good dealmaking environment for PE,” he said. Whether the current widespread public market declines will fuel a further swoop for ad tech from PE circles, similar to how AdTheorent was taken private last year, remains to be seen. Still, more sources stated this would be governed by PE’s’ comfort levels with the impact of AI on the business models of ad tech. For many, Scope3’s recent launch exemplifies the potential of the disruptive impact of “agentic AI tools,” with the business models of traditional programmatic trading outfits and measurement firms expected to be challenged. Dave Helmreich, CEO of TripleLift — an ad tech company that was bought by PE firm Vista Equity Partners in 2021 after it considered an IPO — echoed Kawaja’s thoughts that not all S-1 filings will result in a public listing. He added that his firm used its funds (the company was valued at $1.4 billion in the latest PE deal) to subsequently drive differentiation as a supply-side platform, principally with its $150 million purchase of 1plusX* in 2022. Sources approached by Digiday noted that pressurized margins will most likely impact the scale of 2025 exits compared to the more frothy days of 2021. Additionally, premiums in 2021 were also driven by the fact that many ad tech companies were entertaining overtures from both PE firms as well as their peers that were newly minted on the public markets. “The difference between 2021 and the late 2010s is that there was a lot of exuberance in both public and private markets… and valuations as a result were much higher [in 2021],” observed GTCR’s Master. He further echoed Kawaja’s observation that the prevalence of AI may cause some PE entities to wait until they can fully understand the impact such technologies will have on the space before they make significant further investments. Meanwhile, several sources, many of whom requested anonymity to maintain business relationships, noted how demand-side platforms’ and SSPs’ take-rates have been under pressure compared to 2021. One corporate development source, who declined to be named, noted that some mid-range ad tech companies picked up by PE firms at the height of the 2021 M&A surge will likely be offloaded as margin compression means they could soon breach their debt covenants. The source added, “In 2021, valuations were high, and there was reason to believe the dynamics that drove those trends would continue, but what you actually got was stagflation — a lot of people call that the ‘Covid whiplash.’” A separate financing source, who similarly requested anonymity, added, “If you overpaid for assets in 2021, you might find it difficult to restore value, but you could have big retailers like Walmart looking to buy their own tech. Why wouldn’t you when you have players like Amazon gaining in the market?” Meanwhile, Atlas Technology Group’s Brian Andersen — a banker who worked on deals this year, including DoubleVerify’s purchase of Rockerbox and Publicis’ Lotame deal — told Digiday 2025 activity would likely be “muddled.” Andersen’s comments referenced widespread cutbacks in the digital sector following its massive acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic — as exemplified by mass layoffs at Big Tech companies. He added, “Personally, I thought 2024 would be more active for M&A, but in reality, it turned into more of a recovery year. I’m still convinced it [2025] will be a decent year.” Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the company’s name was “X+1.” Marketers at Honda’s Acura brand are pressing ahead with a spring SUV launch campaign, despite threat from tariff uncertainty. What are other auto advertisers thinking? Agencies say Google reps are using aggressive sales tactics to push AI media buying tools like Performance Max and Demand Gen. Meta is now in the principal-based buying business, putting its own twist on the hotly debated practice in talks with agency holdcos.
