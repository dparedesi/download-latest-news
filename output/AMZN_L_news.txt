Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.

The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust

Time Published: 2025-02-20T18:15:38Z

Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Tech Giants Slash Jobs as AI and Efficiency Take Priority

Major technology companies are shedding thousands of jobs in a fresh wave of layoffs, signaling a strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and leaner operations amid economic headwinds. In the past week alone, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., OpenText Corp., and others have announced cuts affecting over 6,500 workers, part of a broader 2025 trend that has already seen more than 10,800 tech jobs vanish. Behind the numbers: a race to integrate AI, appease investors, and sharpen performance in an industry once defined by rapid growth. Meta kicked off the latest round, notifying some 3,600 employees—5% of its workforce—on Feb. 10 that their roles would end. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg called it a move to “raise the bar” on performance, targeting low performers in a blunt internal memo. The cuts, reported by Bloomberg, follow a December reduction of equal size, bringing Meta’s total layoffs since 2022 past 24,000. Workday, a leader in human-resources software, followed on Feb. 12, axing 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its staff. CEO Carl Eschenbach tied the decision to a push into AI, aiming to redirect funds from legacy roles to high-growth bets. OpenText, meanwhile, disclosed plans on Feb. 13 to eliminate 1,200 positions, citing cost efficiencies as investor pressure mounts. Elsewhere, Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit rolled out a voluntary exit program for its Platforms & Devices team, offering U.S. employees severance to depart, a shift from traditional layoffs. Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. also trimmed staff this month—Microsoft targeting underperformers, Salesforce cutting over 1,000 while hiring for AI roles, and Amazon paring its communications and sustainability units as part of a broader plan to shed 14,000 managerial jobs by spring. The drivers are clear: AI is reshaping tech’s labor landscape. Companies are slashing headcounts to fund automation and machine-learning initiatives, with Workday and Salesforce explicitly linking cuts to AI investment. A World Economic Forum survey projects 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years—a future arriving early in 2025. Economic realities bolster the case. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report showing 353,000 new positions in January, tech firms face demands for profitability. OpenText aims to save millions annually, while Amazon’s cuts align with a goal to trim billions in costs. Performance, too, is under scrutiny: Meta and Microsoft are culling weaker contributors, signaling a meritocratic turn. Strategic realignment rounds out the picture. Google’s voluntary exits and Salesforce’s dual cut-and-hire approach reflect a shift toward AI and cloud priorities. Nokia Corp.’s leadership handover this week to Justin Hotard, an infrastructure-focused executive, hints at similar moves ahead. The cuts are rattling tech’s workforce. Employees at Meta voiced shock on social media, with some high performers caught in the crosshairs, eroding trust after years of layoffs. A Washington Post analysis warns of stifled innovation as morale dips—a risk for an industry reliant on creativity. The job market is splitting: AI-savvy workers find opportunities, while others face obsolescence. Hiring persists in IT and finance, but the Economic Report of the President estimates 10% of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to AI disruption. Competitively, leaner firms may gain an edge—SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., for instance, are channeling savings into AI and digital-commerce platforms. Culturally, tech’s ethos is shifting. Gone are the cushy perks of the 2010s; in their place, a pragmatic focus on efficiency. Posts on X this week called it a loss of “decorum,” with Meta’s candid rhetoric and Google’s exit offers underscoring the change. More layoffs loom. According to a recent business survey, some 45% of U.S. managers expect AI and economic pressures to drive cuts this year. Still, stabilizing venture funding adds urgency for startups and giants alike to streamline. Yet growth persists—data-center expansions by Pulsant and connectivity projects like Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable signal a robust future for those who adopt. For workers, the message is stark: Upskill or risk irrelevance. For companies, balancing cuts with innovation is the tightrope to watch. Tech’s workforce reckoning is here—and 2025 is its proving ground.

Title: Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fund big AI bets

Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Washington Post backs out of running $115,000 front page advertisement targeting Elon Musk

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 5:13:14 AM PST by dennisw The Jeff Bezos' owned Washington Post has reportedly backed out of running a $115,000 front page advertisement targeting DOGE head Elon Musk amid the Amazon founder's budding friendship with President Donald Trump. Advocacy group Common Cause announced that it had signed the costly agreement with the newspaper to run an ad that would have covered the entire front and back page of Tuesday's paper as well as a full page advertisement inside the paper. The group said it planned to purchase the ad in collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund. Copies of the paper with the wrap would then be sent to subscribers on Capitol Hill, at the Pentagon and at the White House, according to The Hill. The ad's design, which is still available on the group's website, features a large photo of Musk with his head tilted back, laughing, along with a cutout image of the White House. 'Who's running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?' it asked. Further down on the page, the advertisement features smaller text that reads: 'Since day one, Elon has created chaos and confusion and put our livelihoods at risk. And he is accountable to no one but himself. 'The Constitution only allows for one president at a time,' it says. 'Call our senators and tell them it's time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk.' It also included the URL FireMusk.org.

Title: The Cult of the Entrepreneur

Full Content:
Three cheers for the entrepreneur! Three cheers for that swashbuckling master of society’s rocky, reef strewn seas! They are the best! They are good vibes! And who are “they,” you ask so skeptically? The entrepreneur is a small-business owner, a David to the Goliath of corporate conformity. He is also an incredibly wealthy business founder who presides over a massive, nonunionized workforce and is something of a Goliath himself. Three cheers for both David and Goliath! Ray Kroc and Sam Walton: definitely entrepreneurs. Their employees: not. But someone can be an entrepreneur while also being an employee, working at a huge company. This is getting confusing. Entrepreneurs make their own work, love their jobs, and never complain. Because they can’t! Because they are self-employed and/or their own boss. Three cheers for the entrepreneur who is an individual above all else, with no connection to any other person beyond the money that can be extracted from them! Now that I consider it, I’m not sure what exactly an entrepreneur is. Is it just someone who starts a business? But why is starting a business good, when we don’t know what kind of businesses are being started? Conservatives surely don’t want more abortion access startups, and liberals wouldn’t rally behind a new gun manufacturer. The term is mind-bogglingly inclusive, as the historian Erik Baker notes in his new book, Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America, which chronicles the creation and ascendance of the idea of entrepreneur from the end of the nineteenth century until today, through the writings of popular psychologists, self-help authors, and management theorists. “Our image of ‘the entrepreneur,’” Baker writes, is “dominated by two antipodal figures: the tech billionaire and the gig worker using that billionaire’s app to scrape out an income.” When both the ruler and ruled are entrepreneurs, what could it possibly mean? We live in a time in which all our lives are dominated by massively powerful monopoly corporations, and yet we focus on a mythical, marginal figure. The triumphalism of the entrepreneur reached a fever pitch in the period following the Great Recession. The entrepreneur was valorized everywhere, accepted as a universal good, touted by extreme conservative business leaders and social democrats alike. Thousands of business school courses on entrepreneurship are taught by scores of endowed chairs. But why? What is so special about entrepreneurialism and small business? Two new books show how the celebration of small business and the entrepreneur has recurred in American history, emerging out of crises, playing to vague notions of democratic ideals and diverting attention from those who caused these crises in the first place. When the founders of the United States got together to draft their framework for a government, industrial production—large factories churning out goods with large workforces tending machinery—only existed at the margins. The country was an agrarian economy with small cities and a high degree of self-employment. Firms were generally small, and even by 1850 the average employer had only about eight employees. (Though rare, large employers like the New England cotton producer Pacific Mills had thousands of workers.) And so it was that the rise of the industrial economy after the Civil War caused a major existential crisis for the young nation. With the new machines and mass production, firms got bigger, self-employment declined, and an increasing number of people worked for a wage. For the first time, the nation was no longer a society of farmers and small businesses. But the country had been founded on a vision of autonomy that rested on Thomas Jefferson’s cherished idea of the “yeoman farmer.” The rapid increase in industrial production in the nineteenth century was fed by the twin rise of finance and monopoly businesses, which accelerated the boom-and-bust cycle of the economy as money rushed into and out of sectors and firms. Regularly, the economy would crash, and there were many financial crises between 1873 and 1920. Working people’s hours and income fluctuate wildly as firms try to cut costs during lean time and raise employment in fat ones. Layoffs and wage cuts rained down on workers who had little control over job conditions. Industrialization, that is, invented mass unemployment and instantiated it as a seemingly permanent facet of American life. As Baker points out, the word “unemployment” first appeared in print in 1887. So how did America react to the rolling crises of financial crashes and mass unemployment? Some workers rushed into unions, like the Knights of Labor, that insisted on formalizing and smoothing out these cycles by getting firms to agree to basic wages, regular hours, and constraints on the bosses’ ability to hire and fire willy-nilly. Workers argued that companies should not be able to callously speculate with the futures of their workers’ lives. They demanded more structure and less chaos. But into the chaos of working-class life rushed self-help gurus who admonished working people to abandon the hope of ever taming the corporate leviathans and to go to work for themselves. They suggested that instead of confronting this massive shift in American life, people just ignore it. Writers like Orison Swett Marden, a “bald, mustachioed hotel magnate,” as Baker has it, told his audience that they should pretend to be participating in an open market for their time and effort (even though, he never mentioned, they were legally subordinated to their bosses). “Get this idea that you are an employee out of your head,” he wrote. “You are in business for yourself, selling your skill to your employer.” Technically, the workers were not in business for themselves, but this didn’t matter. This idea provided guidance for the masses of people struggling to understand how they should operate in a society in which their employers, on which their livelihoods depended, didn’t seem to care much about them. Marden founded Success magazine in 1897, a publication that encouraged workers to “make their own job” and “work for a business as if it were your own.” The latter is an idea that corporate types to this day advise each other over coffee. I heard one man giving a younger man this very advice last month in a Manhattan coffee shop. Marden’s advice was part of an intellectual movement called New Thought, which varied in its texture and application, but was a self-help ideology that suggested creativity and happiness could be found even among the grinding realities of the assembly line. It was almost tailor-made for the people who instituted this system—like Henry Ford, who had boiled jobs down from complex craft to repetitive tasks so routine and dull they drove workers crazy, such as tightening the same three bolts on chassis all day as they rolled by on the line. And yet Ford was a big proponent of New Thought and claimed that, as a society, “We have limited the creative faculty too much and have used it for too trivial ends.” This elided the fact that he himself had limited the creativity of work so dramatically that it was essentially outlawed in his factories. These ideas were backed by scientists like Harvard psychologist Hugo Münsterberg, who believed working-class discontent stemmed not from the social and economic conditions brought about by extreme employer power, but from the faulty minds of the workers themselves: “The feeling of monotony depends much less upon the particular kind of work than upon the special disposition of the individual,” he wrote in 1913. New Thought said: If you find work boring, terrible, and scarce, you can change it by changing your attitude! “This advice celebrated the value of innovation while also reassuring those who found stimulating work hard to come by—a welcome message for Henry Ford as well as for those struggling to figure out how to make a life in the world he was reshaping,” Baker writes. Crisis struck again. When the financial crash of 1929 hit, ripping open the gates for the Great Depression to spill out and drown the nation in unemployment, Marden’s message was ready to be updated. Popular psychologists and success writers like Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, and Norman Vincent Peale rushed in with tracts about how enterprising people could find happiness and wealth among devastation just by going into business on their own. One popular book encouraged people to rescue themselves from unemployment by taking up odd jobs, suggesting they could find stability by “making bird houses, reading tea leaves, performing genealogical research, knitting cozies for baby bottles, and even breeding tropical fish,” as Baker finds. The book was today’s equivalent of a TikTok influencer telling you how to get rich on passive income generated from an Amazon third-party seller account and wooden coasters sold on Etsy. Side-hustle advice emerges as a response to economic adversity. The response to the Great Depression on a governmental level was not to celebrate the side hustle but to enable and formalize massive corporations and balance their power with a strong regulatory state and the empowerment of labor unions. Influential theorists who had Franklin Roosevelt’s ear, like the indefatigable Adolf A. Berle, took the model Ford had pioneered and aimed to harness and institutionalize it by reforming securities law, labor law, and creating welfare institutions. The large corporation was thought to be good because of its efficiency: It could more quickly move and deploy capital it raised in public markets than could a set of smaller companies. It could be more easily regulated because it was a single firm with hundreds or thousands of employees. Workers demanded more job security from these firms, and, after a period of sometimes bloody unrest, the government ultimately enabled this project by not only passing the hard-won National Labor Relations Act in 1935, but inventing Social Security and other welfare measures. Midcentury thinkers on the left and right praised the Fordist New Deal state as incontestably better than any alternatives. John Kenneth Galbraith exemplified the consensus from the left when he wrote, “No one seriously argues that the small firm is ordinarily more efficient, more progressive, more responsible, more enlightened, that it pays better wages or that it sells at a lower cost than the large corporation.” Entrepreneurs, be damned. Even conservatives sang the praises of Fordism while casting the entrepreneur to the dustbin of history. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce magazine Nation’s Business wrote, “In the past century the private inventor was our public glory.” Not so in the midcentury, when “most big-time inventions are produced by corporations and their staff of trained engineers.” The conservative management thinker Peter Drucker praised the corporation for its efficiency but also for the way managers operated like enlightened statesmen. Big, bureaucratic corporations were superior. But Fordism was an awkward fit for American life, especially considering that the founding documents of the nation had not said anything about work and were not designed for relations between the owners of gigantic firms like Ford and their workers. The corporation was in no way democratic; even with a union, managers controlled the workers like mini dictators. For the professional workers, the massive corporation provided security, but in return extracted a high degree of control through repression, process, and conformity. The midcentury New Deal state was essentially a privatized socialism, with the corporate leaders holding the reins of society. When the power of the Fordist corporation started to falter in the late 1950s and 1960s, thinkers on both the right and left did an about-face. The conservative journalist William Whyte decried the un-American nature of the corporate office worker in his landmark book, The Organization Man, finding that the large corporation had turned Americans into unthinking, robotic workers. Whyte introduced a critique of the working life under corporate rule that has scarcely gone away: Large companies stifle the American spirit of individual freedom. One bit of evidence that Whyte presented was that hardly any graduating seniors at Yale were interested in being entrepreneurs (by his own survey). This, he seemed to suggest, was a sign of a major character defect. One problem with Whyte’s critique was that this period brought the highest degree of wage growth for working people in U.S. history. But Whyte’s complaint about the lack of entrepreneurialism was not economic. It was an issue with the design of our culture. “The generations of experts who developed and popularized the vocabulary of entrepreneurialism succeeded ... because the gospel of job creation filled a fundamental ideological need in American society,” Baker writes. The left-leaning counterculture also picked up on a critique of corporate life and corporations’ enthusiastic headlong dive into the Vietnam War. Major unions, their fates staked to the Fordist system of private governance, largely supported the war and lost the confidence of young people as the 1960s wore on. The counterculture also decried the homogenizing effect of large corporations that Whyte noted. And positive psychologists and social scientists like Erich Fromm and Abraham Maslow thought that “ego weakness” and conformity opened the door to authoritarianism, the kind of conformity other theorists like David Riesman had found in corporate workers, birthing yet another wave of self-help gurus promoting small business. The counterculture blamed the corporate state and looked elsewhere for solutions, which it would find in adoration of the entrepreneur. Maslow is a fascinating character in Baker’s book, a leading figure who praised and promoted the entrepreneurial attitude while also laying bare its contradictions (though not necessarily on purpose). Maslow once noted that, in the United States, “The entrepreneurial function is too much underplayed and undervalued.” The problem was that workers were too feisty and made things too hard for their “superiors,” who were the real entrepreneurs. American culture had “arranged things in such a fashion that the boss or leader or general or successful person tends to be put on the defensive.” Maslow’s vision of the entrepreneur is, as Baker notes, fairly authoritarian itself. Objections to the massive corporate state amplified in importance as economic growth slowed in the 1960s and wages began to stagnate in the 1970s, leading to the crisis of “stagflation” as both stagnation and inflation escalated. This time, the left critique of corporate malfeasance and the way it encouraged repression of individuality met up with a right-wing critique of the regulatory state, both of which located “entrepreneurialism” and small business as the solution, as Benjamin Waterhouse explores in his book One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America. Waterhouse is a professor at the University of North Carolina, and his book covers similar terrain to Baker’s but is largely about the lobbyists, corporations, and politicians that pushed the ideas of entrepreneurship and the veneration of small business in the United States. The New Deal compact was faltering; the ideas of entrepreneurialism were lying around ready to provide a solution. Business interests could blame regulation and bureaucracy (which had ensured workers got their share of profits and economic progress), while the counterculture could blame corporations for conformity and warmongering. Waterhouse documents how small-business advocates and lobbyists like the National Federation of Small Business denigrated the New Deal order and gathered together to push their interests, which mostly coalesced around fighting any increase in the minimum wage. Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy, was a news fixture representing the beleaguered small business, claiming to reporters, “Every time the minimum wage goes up, we have to lay off a few more people.” The Washington Post in the 1980s noted that politicians no longer thought of small business as weak and unorganized. “Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that small-business owners are numerous, well-organized and very combative,” the Post said. By the 1980s, the odd coalition had quickly raised a dormant idea to an American shibboleth. Reagan praised the “entrepreneur” 186 times in speeches, by one account. The irony, not entirely explored by either book, is that while the Reagan administration and every administration from then on was praising small business and the entrepreneur, they were also dismantling the antitrust regulations that kept large corporations restrained. They were talking out of both sides of their mouths, encouraging the growth and power of the massive corporations while symbolically propping up the little guy. It explains a core contradiction of the entrepreneur: why poster-boy businessmen who are bursting with entrepreneurial spirit (like a Mark Zuckerberg or a Steve Jobs) quickly became monopolists who then closed the door and dragged up the ladder on millions of future small-business owners. You can’t praise the entrepreneur, the self-starter, and the small business while doing nothing about the scourge of corporate concentration. This points to another issue of the promotion of small business and entrepreneurship: It doesn’t present a sound economic argument. As Waterhouse points out, even though politicians have come to recite the phrase “small business is the backbone of the economy” like it is the gospel, there is little evidence that it provides any more job growth or innovation than large corporations do. Most people work for medium- and large-scale enterprises. According to the 2019 census, over 60 percent of people work for companies with over 50 employees. Entrepreneurialism is not the lived experience of most Americans, nor should it be. “There is no economic evidence that a firm’s size has much to do with its economic success or its ability to create jobs,” Waterhouse writes. After the 1980s, he says later, “The notion that small business was the key to innovation and job creation ... became one of the most persistent myths of the late twentieth century.” In fact, as Waterhouse notes, a high degree of self-employment is a sign of an underperforming, ailing economy. Countries like Venezuela and Indonesia have three and four times the self-employment, and it isn’t helping. Typically, underdeveloped economies have far higher levels of self- and informal employment. In that light, the motto at early Apple, “90 Hours a Week and Loving It!” is less a sign of entrepreneurial success than of a struggling organization with unmanageable working hours for employees. So is the valorization of entrepreneurialism just a sunny spin on bad news—the ruling class trying to sell the declining economy as a fun and exciting new thing? It’s possible. It’s also possible that it is a response to the demand by workers for more from their bosses through collective action. Working hours have increased in the last four decades while wages have declined, something that we often celebrate when we celebrate the entrepreneur. It stunts our expectations because we can only look to ourselves and our own bodily limits for work. Can’t drive for Uber 120 hours a week? Then it’s your fault you’ll never pay back your student loans. The celebration of the entrepreneur also does not acknowledge that self-employment is often the only option for workers experiencing discrimination and low wages in the traditional workplace. People driving for Uber or running their own chain motel—often immigrants, women, and Black and brown workers—might have no other choice. The “adulation of scrappy entrepreneurs effectively normalized the unequal and oppressive conditions that pushed many people to business ownership in the first place,” Waterhouse writes. Individual risk-taking is not a solution for societywide problems like discrimination and unemployment. “In an era of massive global corporations, ever-expanding big-box stores, and high-flying finance, how did we decide that self-employment was the dream?” Waterhouse writes. One reason is that it pays lip service to a legitimate goal: freedom and autonomy that comes with democratic government. Much of the praise for small business or entrepreneurship is for the ways that it “eliminates” your boss and thus frees you from illegitimate, arbitrary authority, in the manner that early Americans hoped to emancipate themselves from the arbitrary authority of British rule. As one University of Texas management professor noted, the “figure of the entrepreneur stands tall in American folklore and history,” showing “how satisfying it would be to grab control of life, to be more than a wage slave, to make events happen instead of waiting for the world to move and shake us.” The entrepreneur takes control of their life. This is a worthy goal. However, it’s not clear how exactly small business and entrepreneurialism delivers this. “Putting all our faith in the promise of individual business ownership is both overly simplistic and a political smokescreen that blocks alternative visions to addressing social problems,” Waterhouse writes. Let’s say you’re an extraordinarily powerful person. You’re not, but let’s pretend. You’re a U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker type of person. You deliberately made U.S.-made goods expensive and foreign goods cheap in the 1980s by raising interest rates to previously unseen levels. This initiated a crisis that you knew would happen. Massive unemployment and stagnant wages would be your fault, and if regular people knew this, the entire edifice of the federal government’s political legitimacy could be called into question. But what if there was an ideology that suggested to large portions of the country that the crisis had not stemmed from the pens and keyboards of the ruling class but instead from the negative thoughts that workers themselves possessed? Aha! That their negative, non-entrepreneurial complacency caused it, as they work two—no three—jobs and commute four hours a day because they can’t afford a home near their work anymore. For every crisis initiated by ruling-class buffoonery or outright mendacity, an ideology that valorized the entrepreneur, the individual go-getter, the Johnny-on-the-spot, the hustler, the self-employed trickster God of Real Estate Financing would be a useful ideology for the winners of our social system. So what are we praising when we praise the self-employed and self-starting? Maybe it is more useful to think about what an entrepreneur is not. They are not people who own or run a business. In other words, they are the vast majority of people: employees. If we stretch the definition of “entrepreneur” to include employees who make their own work and never complain, there is another subcategory of people who are definitely not entrepreneurs: union members, organizers, and activists. Entrepreneurialism, by contrast, denigrates the lived experience of most Americans, by making their positions as employees non-praiseworthy. So how could we use the desire for autonomy that the entrepreneur suggests for egalitarian ends instead of atomizing and victim-blaming ones? We don’t need to be nostalgic for the era in which we worshipped big corps—the New Deal order left millions of farmworkers, domestic workers, Black and brown people, and women out of its benevolent umbrella—but we should also pick the ethos of cooperation and solidarity out of that time. To do so would require grassroots organizing, aided by vigorous antitrust enforcement that would break up monopolies and make it easier for workers to leverage their power. Universal health care and reliable unemployment benefits would untether workers from bad workplaces that stifle their autonomy. This way, people could easily quit bad jobs and start their own or find a better workplace. But the focus of autonomy needs to stay on the traditional workplace, because it affects the majority of people. To guarantee American freedom, we need to make the process of forming a union far easier, something that would allow people to change their workplaces for the better, or, better yet, carve out time away from work. The “creativity” that the valorization of entrepreneurship stresses could be put to use in finding ways for people to be happy in their lives, and to find meaning in their communities, instead of just finding ways to be more efficient at work. Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein is a journalist and author of a forthcoming book about the authoritarianism of the American workplace.
