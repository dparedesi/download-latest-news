Good morning. President Donald Trump held a rally this week in Macomb County, Michigan, to mark his first 100 days in office. BI had a reporter in attendance. The key issue for rallygoers they spoke with was, surprisingly, not the economy. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, it's a crucial week for Big Tech. We're breaking down the key details from Meta's and Microsoft's earnings reports — and looking ahead to what Wall Street will be watching for when Apple and Amazon report today. Exciting news: Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Get the scoop on what's happening inside the world's most powerful tech companies — sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Despite the S&P 500's recent rally, Wall Street forecasters see more pain ahead. Tech: Meta, Microsoft, and Google are leading a performance management vibe shift. Business: Why you can expect to see more professionally produced videos on your LinkedIn feed. But first, a moment of truth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a big week for Big Tech. On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn. The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there. The Ms Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs. Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell. The As 1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months. 2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon. 3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI. 1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces. 2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday. 3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs. 1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI. 2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were "no plans" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work. 3. LinkedIn wants a bigger slice of the creator economy. The professional networking site said it's planning to launch five new shows from business-oriented creators, including podcast host Steven Bartlett and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. - Sandy Springs-based UPS says it will support its workers through an upcoming round of layoffs this year. Earlier this week, the company announced that it plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 leased and owned facilities by the end of June. What we know: The package company says the move is part of a plan to drastically reduce the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. In January, UPS announced that it had struck a deal with Amazon, its largest client, to minimize its volume by over 50% by 2026. The company is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. Specific details about which areas of business and what buildings may face the cuts were not released. What they're saying: In a statement to FOX 5, a company spokesperson said UPS was "committed to supporting our employees throughout this process." "While our building footprint is changing, our record of reliable pickup and delivery is not," the statement read. "We remain committed to providing industry-leading service to customers in more than 200 countries and territories around the world." "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement announcing the layoffs. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." By the numbers: The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. This week, United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results. The company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That’s better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street’s estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn’t providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. The Source: Information for this story was taken from a statement by UPS and a report by the Associated Press.

Title: Teamsters President: ‘UPS Will Be in for a Hell of a Fight’ After Layoffs

By Glenn Taylor The announcement from UPS that it would lay off 20,000 employees in 2025 generated some blowback from its largest union. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents more than 300,000 workers at the parcel delivery company, suggested in the hours after the call took place that it was ready to take legal action if any layoffs violate the terms of their current five-year contract. “United Parcel Service is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement,” said Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien in a statement Tuesday afternoon. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” Two years ago, the Teamsters and UPS agreed to the contract after a contentious bargaining period that saw the 1.3-million-member union threaten to go on strike. As the bill from the contract racked up—UPS said it paid $1.4 billion more in compensation and benefits expenses in 2024 due to the deal—cuts had to be made elsewhere. The courier laid off 12,000 employees to start that year, with most of those roles coming from management, as well as some contractors. But those layoffs came along before last year’s introduction of UPS’ Network of the Future, the company’s logistics network consolidation designed to flow more volume into automated warehouses. Under the plan, UPS is closing roughly 200 facilities, namely sortation centers. The company aims to close 73 sites this year. Related Stories Topics UPS Slashes 20,000 Jobs as it Weans Off Amazon Topics Smarter, Greener, Stronger: How Tech is Driving Manufacturing Back to the US From a longer-term perspective, the automation push sows some concern into how many employees will get axed through the end of 2028, when the Network of the Future plan is expected to run its course. When news first broke out that UPS would temporarily shutter a package processing facility in Portland, Ore. on July 1 amid an automation deployment, Teamsters national vice president John Palmer admitted to The Oregonian that the union should have done a better job negotiating contracts that protect workers. “If you’re going to get displaced, based on your years of service there ought to be some sort of severance,” Palmer said. “Automation is a real thing. There’s only so much we can do to stop progress. But the other side of it is when you have a corporation like UPS that makes billions of dollars in profit every quarter.” Additionally, Palmer had suggested that the Teamsters should have sought a contract that promised longtime employees the chance to train for maintenance of automated sorting machines. The scenario in Portland is happening across dozens of facilities that are getting renovated to fully or partly incorporate automation. Reports of a possible brewing partnership with robotics startup Figure AI, in which UPS would use humanoid robots within its warehousing network, are likely to add insult to injury for the Teamsters. UPS never confirmed the partnership talks, or the use of a humanoid robot, but company brass hasn’t been shy about admitting that the automation crusade is going to end up impacting jobs. “The end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor,” said Nando Cesarone, president U.S. at UPS, in Tuesday’s earnings call. The UPS-Teamsters deal, which lasts through July 31, 2028, is supposed to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs, with 7,500 of them being full-time gigs. The master contract has no mention of automation or robotics. UPS isn’t the only logistics player in the Teamsters’ crosshairs. O’Brien took aim at another one of his common targets, Amazon, in a post on X Tuesday following the White House’s blasting of the e-commerce giant for reportedly planning to show added tariff costs on consumer products. “News flash: Amazon has ZERO allegiance to the United States. Decades after free trade politicians sold out American workers, Amazon has built an international empire fueled by industrial slavery managed by the Chinese Communist Party,” wrote O’Brien, in a reference to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s insistence that the company “has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.” Amazon later denied that any tariff-displaying plans were in place. O’Brien’s mini-rant came a week after a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Amazon must collectively bargain with Teamsters-affiliated warehouse workers at a San Francisco distribution center. “While here in the U.S., it neglects, abuses, and disowns an American workforce to further inflate its profit margins,” O’Brien said in his post. “What Jeff Bezos and Amazon are really afraid of is sharing their wealth with the people who created it.

Editor Activism Activist Post, David Icke, Neenah Payne David Icke Banned From 26 Nations For Two More Years!Legendary British author David Icke has been trying to wake up humanity for decades. He has written over 20 books and has spoken to vast audiences in over 25 countries. Icke was invited to attend the 11/5/22 peace rally “Together for the Netherlands” as a featured speaker. However, far-left activist groups demanded that Icke be barred from entering the country. His son Gareth said the Dutch government banned Icke from the country (not just from the rally) for two years on the charge that he is a “Level 3 terrorist”. Because the Netherlands are part of The Schengen area which consists of 25 other European nations, Icke was banned for two years from 26 countries in Europe as well as other countries — including the US and Australia — that follow the guidelines of The Schengen area! Icke had planned a tour throughout much of Europe for the Spring of 2023 where he would have spoken to tens of thousands of people. Icke’s site showed in late 2024 that the ban was extended for two more years – until November 2026!Is the ban permanent? It looks like the globalists don’t want the world to hear Icke’s views. Why?David Icke banned from Europe for ANOTHER TWO YEARS because he has NOT CHANGED HIS VIEWS. Talk about fascism in our face. “The first two-year ban ends in November. I wonder if the mainstream hijack of the ‘alternative’ media might at last have something to say about this having virtually ignored the first ban.” Trailer: Persona Non Grata Persona Non Grata – David Icke’s Brand New Documentary – OFFICIAL TRAILERBanned from Europe and Australia. Demonised. Mocked. With his back straight, chin up and almost supernatural courage, DAVID ICKE has been doing in-depth research into spirituality, conspiracy theories and metaphysical sciences for more than 35 years. His work is about who we really are, what the reality is in which we live and who pulls the strings behind the scenes of the world stage. In the film PERSONA NON GRATA, filmmaker Christianne van Wijk investigates the paradox of David’s infamous image and his real message. A MUST-SEE for anyone who wants to understand what is at stake in a period when censorship is reaching Orwellian proportions. It is high time that the spiritual truth comes to the surface.Film available exclusively on Ickonic at midnight – Saturday 29th April. REGISTER YOUR E-MAIL HERE FOR UPDATES The Global Ban On One Man! David Icke & Chrissy Van Wijk Interview David Icke joins us together with filmmaker Christianne Van Wijk to talk about the new movie PERSONA NON GRATA about David’s unprecedented ban from almost all European and many other countries of the world. Great night at the Dutch premiere of Persona Non Grata – wish I had been there!More wonderful feedback from our audience tonight live in The Netherlands for the exclusive premiere of Persona Non Grata – The Demonisation of David Icke Tune in this Saturday 29th March on http://ickonic.com for the launch! In the video further below, Icke explains why the Netherlands is forcing 3,000 farmers out of business.Icke calls out former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as a puppet of Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum. Icke gave his speech on the beach. Gareth pointed out that because of the ban on his father, more people probably heard his speech below which was posted on his site than if Icke had attended the peace rally! I Icke spoke about the fight of Dutch farmers as the government tries to impose unprecedented restrictions and force them to sell their farms. This affects all of Europe and beyond because the Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. See more information. Icke spoke about Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum as an expression of the global cult taking over the world now. Icke called out Prime Minister Rutte as an asset of the World Economic Forum and told the Dutch people, “He runs your country for the agenda of Klaus Schwab who runs the World Economic Forum for the agenda of the global cult. So, Rutte is not running The Netherlands for the people of that country. He’s running it for the World Economic Forum.Klaus Schwab Resigns: April 2025World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab retires as chairman 4/21/25WEF confirms probe into founder Klaus Schwab 4/23/25WEF launches investigation into founder Klaus Schwab 4/24/25Move comes after Schwab and his wife, Hilde, were reportedly accused of financial and ethical misconduct – which they denyThe Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter! Control of World’s Food SupplyHenry Kissinger was Schwab’s mentor at Harvard and was a frequent honored guest at World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland. Kissinger is known for his statement, “Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control people.” Rutte is a “Young Global Leader” of the World Economic Forum — like former Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and Jacinda Ardern, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook/Meta, and many others. Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum bragged that Trudeau and half his cabinet are WEF “Young Global Leaders”. By 2021, the Young Leaders were showing up as the top leadership positions in a growing number of countries including French President Emmanuel Macron and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. The Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. So, when the Dutch government tried to force 3,000 farmers out of business, it was not just affecting the food supply of The Netherlands, but of much of the world. As the two videos below show, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced that Holland is the headquarters of the “Global Food Hub”. Rutte was the Global Coordinating Secretary to Transform Food Systems and Land Use. DUTCH PM MARK RUTTE CLOSING FARMS, BUT NOW CREATING WEF FOOD HUBS “Local elections in the Netherlands have dealt a huge blow to the incumbent governing coalition, as the anti-government BBB party came out on top. So how did this all play out? Why did the pro-farmer party win? And could this spell the end for Mark Rutte?’ However, Rutte was promoted to serve as the NATO Secretary General in 2024. Is This Why David Icke Was Denied Entry To The Netherlands & Banned From The EU? David Icke’s Banned Speech Icke gave his speech (shown in the video below) on a beach near his home. Icke spoke about the Dutch government trying to force farmers to sell their farms. That affects many nations because the Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. Icke spoke about Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum as an expression of the global cult taking over the world now. David Icke speech for Amsterdam peace rally that he was banned from 26 countries for trying to make David Icke delivering his speech despite being prohibited from attending the peace demonstration. Dutch War on Farmers and Cows The Dutch government wants farmers to give up their land to save the planet. The farmers are fighting back. The Netherlands wanted to ban a large number of farms on the charge that they were causing too much ammonia and nitrogen. The video below explains that nitrogen comes from the synthetic fertilizers used to grow feed for livestock. However, some Dutch farmers know regenerative farming solves those problems as confirmed in the “Common Ground” documentary further below! Common Ground, the documentary released on April 22 (International Mother Earth Day), shows the critical importance of farmers who practice regenerative agriculture. Cows play a huge role in this transformation that can help save us from the Sixth Great Extinction. Film: “Common Ground” – April 22 Globalists maintain that cows are THE cause of our existential crisis and must be reduced. However, in his famous 2013 Ted Talk below, Dr. Allan Savory, founder of Holistic Management, explains that cows are THE solution to the crisis if managed correctly – much as the Plains Indians managed the buffalo! Savory warns: “Poor land leads to poor people which leads to social breakdown”. Dr. Savory’s Ted Talk below How To Green The World’s Deserts and Reverse Climate Change is among the TOP 100 MOST-WATCHED TED TALKS. It now has 5,923,699 views. Dr. Savory explains why livestock — now used on five continents on 37 million acres — are the ONLY protection for soils and water and the ONLY way to save our civilization. He said in his talk at Harvard that this Ted Talk overcame 50 years of academic opposition to these ideas. He explains that when public opinion changes, government policy changes. So, you can help shift policies by sharing this Ted Talk and this article. How to green the world’s deserts and reverse climate change | Allan Savory 3/4/13 “Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,” begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it’s happening to about two-thirds of the world’s grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes — and his work so far shows — that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert. Book: Cows Save the Planet Amazon says: “Kristin Ohlson makes a passionate case for “our great green hope”—a way in which we can not only heal the land but also turn atmospheric carbon into beneficial soil carbon. Thousands of years of poor farming and ranching practices—and, especially, modern industrial agriculture—have led to the loss of up to 80 percent of carbon from the world’s soils. Ohlson introduces scientists, farmers, ranchers, and landscapers who are figuring how to build healthy soil, which solves myriad problems: drought, erosion, air and water pollution, and food quality.” Ohlson says Parker Bosley, a restaurateur, told her, “Carbon farming. That’s the new thing.” He said there was a new movement among small farmers. Sometimes they call themselves soil farmers or microbe farmers, aware of the billions of tiny creatures that were at work in the soil. Sometimes they call themselves carbon farmers, knowing carbon is making their soils richer, moister, and darker. Dr. Kristine Nichols, Chief Scientist, Rodale Institute, says, “In every handful of healthy soil, there are more organisms than the number of people who have ever lived on Planet Earth! Those organisms are processing organic matter in the soil and putting the nutrients into a form the plant needs.” In Soil Health – Dr. Kristine Nichols, Rodale Institute, Dr. Nichols says, “All our soils that are under chemical conventional agriculture are almost completely devoid of microorganisms.” Spraying the soils with toxic chemicals kills the microbes we need to give us health and to pull the carbon from the atmosphere. The film points out, “Taking care of the microbes in the soil is critical for human health”.Cows Save the Planet: And Other Improbable Ways of Restoring Soil to Heal the Earth shows that nature is designed to be self-healing. It explains that Allan Savory’s Holistic Management shows the central role of pasture-fed cows in saving our soils, feeding the world, providing clean water, and restoring the oceans.Allan Savory’s Holistic Management: Key To Soil RestorationRunning out of Time | Documentary on Holistic Management Allan Savory explains how he used Holistic Management to transform his land in Zimbabwe.

Icke’s 2024 book The Reveal: The Next Stage of Human Awareness is the third in his trilogy which was preceded by his 2022 book The Trap and his 2023 book Dream, The: The Extraordinary Revelation Of Who We Are And Where We Are. Amazon Description“David Icke has been writing books for decades warning that current events were coming. He has faced ridicule and abuse for saying that the end of human freedom was being planned, how, and by whom. David Icke’s The Biggest Secret, first published in 1998, has been called the ‘Rosetta Stone’ of the conspiracy movement for the way it exposed how the pieces fit and the nature of the force behind human control.The Trap is the ‘Rosetta Stone’ of illusory reality and opens the door to freedom in its greatest sense. Read this book and the ‘world’ will never look the same again. The veil of illusion shall be swept aside and the amazing truth this has kept from us shall set you free.” The Mainstream Alternative Media (MAM) Icke explains that globalists use the following primary means to control the world’s 8 billion people: Icke quotes Vladimir Lenin to explains how the globalists are handling the challenge by the Alt Media: “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves. Icke shows that many politicians, podcast hosts, etc.) who appear to oppose globalization are either dupes or are complicit.The Reveal: The Next Stage of Human Awareness provides a depth of insight into what’s really going on and why. The book discusses many of the icons of what Icke calls the “Mainstream Alternative Media”. He explains that Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson, Russell Brand, James O’Keefe (Founder of Project Veritas), Candace Owens, Don Bongino, Andrew Tate, Rumble are part pf the “controlled opposition”. Icke also calls out Mark Zuckerberg, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Mark Andreessen who founded Netscape, Bret Weinstein, and Eric Weinstein.

However, Icke warns that Musk is the soft sell for AI to get people to trust the next steps which will ultimately be devastating for humanity. Icke explains that Elon Musk is part of the globalist Cult which plans direct control of our thinking by merging our brains with Artificial Intelligence.

Title: UPS To Lay Off 20,000 Workers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2025/04/30/ups-to-lay-off-20000-workers/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T18:22:07Z
Full Content:
BySteve Banker BySteve Banker, Contributor. A Teamster employee delivering a package for UPS Amidst falling consumer confidence - the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since 2011 - United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) announced it is laying off 20,000 workers. UPS believes that they are the world’s largest package delivery company. The logistics industry is considered a bellwether industry that can provide an advanced warning of a recession. Does the massive layoff at UPS signal that bad times are coming? UPS announced the layoff during its first quarter 2025 earnings call on Tuesday. In addition to laying off 20,000 employees, the company plans to close 73 buildings by the end of June and reduce the total number of hours devoted to operations by their workers by 25 million. Carol Tomé, the CEO of UPS, also commented that uncertainty surrounding global trade policies led to a drop in consumer confidence and muted demand from some larger customers, but particularly from their small and medium-sized customers. In terms of average daily shipping volumes, this drop in what they forecast occurred in February and March as the tariff turmoil increased. The company forecasts that its cost-saving measures will lead to $3.5 billion in cost reductions in 2025. Roughly 35% of the cost savings will come from the layoff. The Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien reacted to the announcement by pointing out that UPS “is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement. If the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” The economic news is not as bad as it first appears. While the layoff had not been announced, the company had announced a plan to reduce its reliance on Amazon as a customer. Amazon is their largest customer. The company reached an agreement with Amazon to reduce its volume in its network by more than 50% by June 2026. “The volume we are transitioning out (of) is Amazon's fulfillment center outbound volume,” Ms. Tomé explained. “This volume is not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network. The Amazon volume we plan to keep is profitable.” Secondly, the layoffs are also driven, in part, by new automation. The company had announced a Network of the Future initiative. UPS is automating sortation, using robotics for automatic label applications, and automating the unloading and loading of trailers. 64% of their volume went through automated facilities in the first quarter. That is an improvement of about four and a half percent year over year. In addition to reducing costs, UPS believes that automation will improve its ability to better handle shifts in volume and regional shifts in shipping. UPS imports of roughly 400,000 pieces per day into the U.S. Last year, revenue on its China to U.S. trade lane represented 11% of their international revenue. The China to U.S. trade lanes are UPS’s most profitable lanes. The change to the de minimis rule, which exempted shipments that had a value of less than $800 from tariffs, had been expected to have a significant impact on freight forwarders and parcel consolidators. That change is having an effect. “We've talked with our top 100 customers to understand how their business is being impacted, both directly and indirectly, by changes in trade policy,” Ms. Tomé said. “These customers have told us that they are exploring various options to address the tariffs.” These range from absorbing the cost, to increasing retail prices to reflect the increase in tariff costs, to asking suppliers to help defray the expense. “At this point, it remains an open question as to what path they will choose and what the potential impact could be on consumer demand and our business.” Through the middle of April, this logistics behemoth interviewed nearly 45,000 international and freight forwarding customers to ascertain their shipping plans. “For small package shippers,” the CEO explained, “over 95% of those customers have told us that they expect to maintain the current business model, while the rest are considering several options, including trade shifts, transportation mode shifts, or exiting the business.” These customers also told UPS they are pursuing a wait-and-see strategy by selling down their current inventory. This will hurt UPS’s shipping volumes in the short term, but the company expects it to rebound as its customers begin sourcing outside of China and shipping on other trade lanes. Navigating the complexities surrounding tariffs can be a nightmare for shippers. This complexity can benefit UPS. UPS has developed technology that makes it easier for its customers to reclassify goods under Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes. Further, Ms. Tomé said, “our new global checkout product makes it known what customers will pay for duties, taxes, and fees.” Its checkout technology enables UPS’s customers to display to their customers a guaranteed blended cost – a cost that covers all duties, taxes, and fees - during online checkouts. “Global checkout is available in 43 origin countries, and UPS is the only global carrier that offers a guaranteed landed cost that's integrated into shipping and billing technology.” Finally, for its customers exploring new trade options, UPS provides bonded warehousing. Bonded warehouses are in designated Foreign Trade Zones. A foreign-trade zone is a designated location in the United States where companies can use special customs procedures that can be used to delay or reduce duty payments on foreign merchandise. “The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years. So, the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any of our scenarios will play out,” the CEO exclaimed. “But by modeling different scenarios, we'll be able to adjust to rapid shifts in the business.” Because of the uncertainty, UPS is not providing full-year guidance to financial analysts.

Title: Amazon and Saks Fifth Avenue launch luxury e-commerce storefront

Let Fashion Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The partnership will feature an assortment of high-end men’s and women’s brands, including Balmain, Stella McCartney and Fear of God. Amazon has been trying to break into luxury fashion since at least 2020, but for the most part, the e-commerce giant has struggled to connect with clothes-conscious consumers. Even Amazon Haul, the company’s fast fashion offering launched last year, has so far failed to bring in the same level of customer excitement as competitors such as Shein and Temu. With this new venture, Amazon may have found a partner with enough name recognition to finally capture elite online shoppers. Jenny Freshwater, vice president of Amazon Fashion, Fitness and Creators, said in the release that Amazon customers want to shop more high-end brands. “This collaboration with Saks furthers Amazon’s commitment to supporting the luxury industry and increasing our assortment for customers, while maintaining an elevated shopping experience that meets the varying tastes of our diverse customer base,” said Freshwater, who took over Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness division in 2023. Initial brands in the storefront include Dolce&Gabbana, Balmain, Etro, Stella McCartney, Giambattista Valli, Erdem, Fear of God, Jason Wu Collection, Rosetta Getty, Johanna Ortiz, Chantecaille and La Prairie, per the release. More labels will be added following the launch, although the release did not specify additional brand names. “This collaboration underscores Saks Fifth Avenue’s reputation as a leader in luxury curation, as well as our commitment to reinventing luxury shopping so that each customer’s experience is unmistakably their own,” Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer at Saks Global, said in the release. “We are delighted to collaborate with an incredible group of forward-thinking brand partners for launch, and we look forward to expanding selection with additional brands as we evolve the experience.” An editorial campaign accompanying the launch was directed by Max Siedentopf, and the online storefront is also being promoted via a window installation at the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship store. Saks Global, parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off Fifth, completed its acquisition of the Neiman Marcus Group, which includes Bergdorf Goodman, in January. Following the close of the deal, Saks Global announced multiple rounds of layoffs, including job eliminations resulting from the closure of a fulfillment center earlier this month.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. 2025 college graduates are entering a tough job market as the economy shrinks and more experience ... More workers who've been laid off compete for the same positions. Between a slowing economy, an influx of former federal workers looking for new jobs and an overall tightening labor market, the job prospects for 2025 graduates aren’t looking too bright. While college students across the country will sit for their final exams in the coming weeks, the reality of life after school will likely be much different from what they expect: About 82% of students in of the class of 2025 anticipate having a full-time job three months after graduation, while only 77% of recent graduates have accomplished that, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. There is an increasing gap between those that can land a job quickly versus those taking six months or more to find a full-time gig. Nursing or health science majors should be able to find employment a bit easier, as these two sectors led employment gains in the last month. But jobs for computer science majors and software engineers have slowed—unless you have AI skills. Political science majors are also seeing their job prospects shrink. The federal government is contracting thanks to DOGE-led cuts, eliminating early-career fellowships and other opportunities for thousands across the country. For the government jobs left at the state and local level, recent grads are likely competing with those departing from federal jobs. To make matters worse, internships aren’t converting to full-time employment as frequently as before, according to a survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Still, graduates are optimistic: About 83% said they were confident in their job prospects after commencement, according to a Monster report. We’ll keep our eyes out for this week’s upcoming labor report to see exactly what 2025 grads will be facing. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Instead of rage quitting, try these four tactics before ruining your career. Go the extra mile and more tips on getting an entry-level role without previous experience.

More push their bosses to adopt the same mindset. AI use is becoming an increasingly important part of work. From taking courses on “AI skills” to AI agents that should increase our productivity, companies are pushing for AI adoption at different rates. The most proactive have been coined “frontier firms” by a new Microsoft work trends report. I spoke with report author and senior research director Alexia Cambon about what this means for employees outside of frontier firms and how workers can advocate for more AI use. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. The adoption task seems pretty straightforward for workers at “frontier firms.” But what happens to those working at companies behind the curve? Your organization needs you to become a frontier firm employee, even if it’s not a frontier firm. I see this even within my own team. So for example, I have a data scientist who’s the best data scientist in the world. But we are also actively bringing in all the data science tools you can imagine that allow me to rely less on him for data science. Our entire relationship is about data science, so that naturally raises questions. For him, it’s: “What does that mean for the work I do?” I have never seen anyone go after AI and agents as quickly or as hungrily as this man. He has literally built half of the agents for you. He’s gone out and experimented with everything left, right, and center. Ultimately, we need him desperately. Even if his data science skills can be done through agents, his ingenuity and figuring out how agents can be used for data science, I need that from him. So that’s what I would say to employees reading the report and wondering, “What does this mean for me? I don’t work in a frontier firm.” Just last year’s report saw that employees were bringing AI to work, whether it was secret or not. We need employees to do that and force the conversation, because that is the type of employee that will be most needed. One that is really hungry to go out there and initiate the change. That’s a big shift from last year, right? Now employers, instead of workers, are pushing AI adoption. Where is this coming from? I think it just points to the fact that business demands are increasing because the pace is accelerating so quickly. At the level it’s at now, it is just too fast for humans alone to deal with, especially with this emphasis on productivity and efficiency, and we’re not running out of work. It’s funny, there are these conflicting tensions of people being terrified that AI is coming for their jobs and that we’re not going to have any jobs left, versus organizations needing productivity, needing more capacity. I personally don’t think we’re running out of work. I don’t think we’ll ever run out of work to do. We live in an age of convenience––everything is available at the press of a button! And work is a constant balance of energy. You probably have types of work that really drain you of energy and types of work that really energize you and make you excited and happy. We don’t wanna spend our energy budget on the types of work that drain us. That’s what AI is here to do––to lift the mundane out of our work. So how can employees master these “AI skills” to make their work life easier? I wouldn’t say there’s any one right way, the outcomes will dictate what works best. But I think there’s a responsibility on every employee to take full advantage of the training that their company is providing. And if the company isn’t providing any training, then shout out from the rooftops and say that if we wanna stay relevant and competitive we need to train the entire workforce to have these skills. We see the beginnings of AI usage becoming part of performance reviews or job development considerations. So the infrastructure will continue to grow around this to really incentivize people to use it, the same way today we can’t imagine doing, say our taxes, without the internet.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Before his second term began, President Donald Trump said that tariffs were “not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.” He said they will make a “great economy.” He said they “will MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.” That was the plan, anyway. Trump is a good salesman, and he has found buyers for a lot of junk over the years, from steaks to supplements to degrees from Trump University. But this time the sales job is failing. Though many voters unfortunately believed his pitch through the 2024 presidential election, more and more of the public has figured out that tariffs don’t work the way Trump claims, especially when they’re so haphazard and unpredictable that what the administration is doing can barely be called a “policy.” Remarkably, they have reached those conclusions even before tariffs really start to increase prices, empty shop shelves and hurt the wider economy. When that happens, a bad start for Trump 2.0 could become a political catastrophe. The MAGA faithful may still trust the president on the economy, but the rest of the country doesn’t. Already, most Americans don’t trust Trump’s handling of the economy. Only 35% of respondents in a CNN poll approved of his handling of tariffs. An ABC News/Washington Post poll put the number at 34%, with 7 in 10 people saying tariffs will drive up inflation. An NPR/PBS/Marist poll pegged approval of Trump’s handling of the economy as a whole at 39%, while a Reuters/Ipsos poll had him at 37% on that question. Consumer confidence has dropped to its lowest level since the start of the Covid pandemic. In other words, the MAGA faithful may still trust the president on the economy, but the rest of the country doesn’t.One didn’t have to be familiar with those numbers to get the picture from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flailing in a Tuesday morning news conference as he tried to reconcile all the contradictory impulses and goals of the president’s ever-changing tariff policy. Bessent claimed that Trump was cleverly deploying “strategic uncertainty” to keep other countries off guard. “I think that tariffs will bring back American manufacturing and generate substantial revenues,” he added. But it’s impossible to negotiate with someone who won’t say what he wants from other countries or keeps changing those asks. Even the two goals Bessent stated are in direct conflict. If tariffs bring back American manufacturing, that means consumers will be buying American-made goods, which means less tariff revenue. If they bring in substantial revenues, it means consumers are continuing to buy foreign-made goods and American manufacturing languishes. Even a statement of fact about how tariffs generate revenue is enough to send the administration into a rage. Early Tuesday morning, Punchbowl News reported that Amazon would follow other companies in showing customers exactly how much increased prices are the result of the administration’s tariffs. Such a move would be very public evidence against the administration’s contention that tariffs generate revenue not as costs passed on to consumers, but as money from thin air. At Tuesday’s news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded with characteristic vitriol. “I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon’s announcement,” she told reporters, “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.” According to NBC News, Trump even made a personal call to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to complain about the report. The company later said that it had considered breaking out tariff charges on its low-priced Amazon Haul site, but decided against it. At least Bezos and his businesses won’t be targeted for revenge by Trump (for now). Amid his verbal squirming in Tuesday’s news conference, Bessent offered a perhaps unintended revelation. But no amount of spin will matter if Americans see the effects of the tariffs in their own lives. While nothing is certain and economic conditions can always change, it sure looks like we’re headed for bad times. Bookings on container ships coming to the U.S. have already dropped significantly, suggesting the possibility of shortages; the Port of Los Angeles says shipping volume will be down 35% starting next week. Business investment is “paralyzed,” write Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Steven Tian of the Yale School of Management, as companies wait to see whether the tariffs will go up or down, or just disappear. Investment firm Apollo Global Management now forecasts a chain of events — imports slowing, trucking company layoffs, empty shelves and consumer pullback — that culminates in a recession by this summer. Major Wall Street firms place the chance of a recession this year between 40% and 65%. Amid his verbal squirming in Tuesday’s news conference, Bessent offered a perhaps unintended revelation. “President Trump is interested in the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past,” the secretary said. “We don’t need to necessarily have a booming textile industry like where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that back.” But textiles and other low-cost goods that rely on cheap foreign labor are subject to Trump’s tariffs, which means higher prices for consumers even if Americans won’t ever make those products again. And while precision manufacturing is great, it tends to be much more automated, which requires a smaller number of highly skilled employees. That means Americans won’t be working in that kind of factory by the tens of millions. In other words, Bessent accidentally summed up the effects of Trump’s tariffs: we’ll pay higher prices, but get little in return. Even before we feel the worst of it, Americans already understand. They aren’t happy and, if a recession comes, Trump will really feel their wrath. Paul Waldman is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in dozens of publications.

Pre-script: Reader and now close friend Phil Giammattei could use some help with a horrible brush with cancer in the family. You can support him here. Update: You all crushed Phil's goal, thank you so much for your generosity. Things are obviously Extremely Bad in many parts of the world right now, and it's wonderfully refreshing to see people pull together, even if it is for a degenerate like Phil. I'd also like to take a moment to curse the person that dethroned me from my spot of Top Donation, and to double-curse them for doing it anonymously, embarrassing me further. Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me 'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here The most treasured object in my home is the cheapest bookshelf I could find. It has been overflowing for quite some time, despite my efforts to only buy books of exceptional quality and relegating the rest to my kindle. Many of the books are unread, but that hasn't stopped me from adding to the pile1. My partner has gracefully accepted that I will stop at every bookstore that looks remotely interesting, and patiently reminds me that my past-self has issued strict orders to my current-self to stop acquiring tomes until I have space for a second bookshelf. Over time, I have dropped from buying a book a week to one every month, which represents a spectacular effort for me. Despite the gradual development of what I'd like to think of as iron will, I caved upon stumbling across this particular edition of A Wizard of Earthsea. This was a repudiation of all that hard-won bookshelf space saving. I had read A Wizard of Earthsea when I was thirteen, and I didn't really get it. It was a book about wizards. So what? It was slow and ponderous, and my teenage self knew that an interesting wizard should be firing lightning bolts at dragons. But the illustration on this copy of the book was so gorgeous that I bought it anyway. It was only when I slotted it into my bookshelf, and it was fully juxtaposed against the others, that I realized how hideous so many of my other books were. I treasure their contents, but consider the first two books I pulled at random from the shelf. The Robin Hobb book on the left is generally beautiful, but it is done a disservice by the George R.R Martin quote splayed across the front cover, its marketing payload expended the moment I purchased the book, but which I am nonetheless obligated to look at for the next thirty years. Almost all my books are thus marred. And this is, sadly, a relatively tasteful example compared to much of the competition. Consider instead the copy of American Gods on the right, sweet merciful Christ, it is a truly repulsive abomination2. Just look at it. The quote at the top is George R. R. Martin once again, which says something about what marketing departments think is impactful. In the top right, we see Ian McShane, which is incredibly jarring because I know him only for his role in John Wick. Along the bottom we have the tedious "No. 1 Bestselling Author". And most offensively, thanks to the screaming red bubble, my descendants will forever know that this precious artefact handed down from their great grandfather once had a no-doubt mediocre second season on Amazon Prime, whatever the fuck an "Amazon Prime" is. Did they turn the rainforest into a cinema when they were done destroying it? Upon closer inspection, my bookshelf is riddled with tasteless advertising smuggled into my home by boring marketing departments, and I am not open to arguments that this meaningfully boosts sales. Some people might have differing taste, but this is bland to the point of nothingness. At least erotica has the decency to slap a shirtless hunk on there, and we can envision the target demographic. Not a shred of this crassness is evident in this copy of A Wizard of Earthsea, and some part of me thought "This is Quality", and amidst the shrieking cacophony of the other titles ("New York Times Bestseller! Twilight Meets Game Of Thrones! Breathtaking!"), it is the one I walked away with. It is now one of my favourite books. A Wizard of Earthsea is a towering work of genius. Going back to it now that I'm older, I must simply accept that my teenage judgement was... well, a teenager's judgement. It is beautifully written, wise, and it does not feel the need to overstay its welcome with contemporary notions of how long a book should be. The writing speaks for itself: "You want to work spells,'"Ogion said presently, striding along. "You've drawn too much water from that well. Wait. Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine times patience." He spoke softly and his eyes were somber as he looked at Ged. "You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man’s real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do..." While it was not a given, it is not surprising that the gentleness of the prose is matched perfectly with the elegance of the overall presentation. What was surprising is that cracking open the book reveals an introduction from Le Guin herself, specifically lamenting the immense difficulty she had over the years in simply getting artwork done which was not at terrible odds with the contents. ... until very recently, the books of Earthsea had no illustrations. This was partly my own decision. After Ruth's unique wraparound jacket for the first edition of A Wizard of Earthsea — with its splendidly stylized, copper-brown portrait face — cover art for the books mostly went out of my control. This is the beautiful cover to which Le Guin is referring. Le Guin continues: The results could be ghastly — the droopy, lily-white wizard of the first Puffin UK paperback;... ...the silly man with sparks shooting out of his fingers that replaced him... ... I was ashamed of the covers that gave the reader every wrong idea about the people and the place. I resented publishers' art departments that met any suggestion that the cover might resemble something or someone in the book by rejecting it, informing me loftily that they Knew what would Sell (a mystery that no honest cover designer would ever claim to know). Let us take a moment to appreciate how funny those covers are, and then take another moment to soak up some secondhand embarrassment — somewhere, alive or dead, there are people that told fucking Le Guin how to go about her business, to turn her characters from brown-skinned to white, who perhaps even rejected some early manuscripts. And at least some of them must be aware that Ursula K. Le Guin took a moment to personally light them the fuck up in the foreword of one of the most famous books of all time. This is not the first time that I've seen people in the publishing industry complain about the narrow-mindedness of their peers. Consider the afterword from my copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which includes a letter from Pirsig's original editor, James Landis, who went to immense lengths to have the book published: The book is not, as I think you now realize from your correspondence with other publishers, a marketing man's dream, and if our particular variety of that species... tries to make trouble over the book, I'll just have to supply what pressure I can to overrule him: I'm determined to fight this thing through to the end you and I desire... No sense in trying to kid you by pretending that the book is 'commercial' in the way that term is understood by most people in publishing... However, I have ultimate faith in the book's being good, valuable, which gets us into standards beyond commercial and gets us also into what, to my mind, publishing is all about. That was from the 40th anniversary reprinting. We could speculate about the unknown unknowns — perhaps there are thousands of James Landis' out there, and we are witnessing the one who survived. It is surely possible to publish a phenomenal book and have it be ignored. But for my money, what happened is that Landis has real taste, and that while the modern economy sometimes appears to be filled entirely by bullshit, that only makes it easier for quality to win out if you're willing to stake something on it. But it doesn't come easily, because if you want to do anything interesting, and probably weird, you will immediately be besieged, from within and without, by tedious people and tired ideas. Getting permission from people without soul in the game is oppressive. Consider the final line from Landis above: However, I have ultimate faith in the book's being good, valuable, which gets us into standards beyond commercial and gets us also into what, to my mind, publishing is all about. If you run into Landis and his ilk, perhaps you can do something interesting. You have someone in your corner, who will perhaps take a risk on your behalf, because while they may preserve the skin they have in the game by refusing to be weird in front of their peers, they have to choose between that and their soul. But you will probably not run into Landis. You will probably meet the typical editor, who would be delighted if you offered to write Grit meets The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck3. You will meet the real estate agent who will never be swayed by considerations other than the size of your bank account, or the government bureaucrat who will decide that you cannot immigrate because you are two days below the age of 23, or some other tasteless and impotent cog. Even consider startups, a community replete with people who jerk themselves off to the label of entrepreneur so hard that they're at risk of permanent groinal damage. And because we do work with some startups, I will make apologies to the twelve sane startup founders out there.4 It's distressing how many young people are under the impression that startups are where you go to innovate and assert yourself. You're young, full of optimism, and have minimal obligations. Your only real weakness is your lack of experience, and it is with that inexperience that you... you sign a deal with people who are possibly dozens of years your senior in cunning, law, and finance? To play games on their terms, where you're a total loser if the business earns just enough money to live comfortably on your own terms? Where you have to justify your decisions, where they can pressure you to sell more of your equity, and ultimately appoint a new CEO if you make a misstep? But I digress. To continue the theme of publishing, last year I was approached by an editor at a mid-tier publisher. I made sure to read some of the editor's short stories before our first meeting, and it turned out they were themselves a talented writer with a real passion for the craft. In fact, while looking up the link to the article above, I discovered they published a book as recently as 2024. And they wanted to help me get published! My name, on a book! I knew that it was unlikely to do any significant sales, as blog-writing and book-writing are two very different skills, but still! A book! Things progress well over the next few days, and it turns out the editor shared many of my frustrations with how companies run. Just as it looked like I was going to sign on, the sales team comes with their Opinions, and I must sadly say that they were not sophisticated Opinions. To begin with, they wanted to stipulate that swearing was absolutely not allowed before knowing anything else about me or what we wanted to write. I wasn't actually intending to swear much, if at all, but I also saw no need to limit myself up front. Why agree to play left-handed before we've even tried out the game? More conditions are added. They will not even guarantee that they'll try to get it on bookshelves. I reach out to some other people who have published with them, they reveal that they were forced to write their entire book in Microsoft Word templates. Communications were confused and unclear. Even the payments were described as "opaque". Basically everything you would expect out of the typical tech project. A picture begins to emerge, of a serious editor trying to do their best, surrounded by colleagues who are about as unserious as anything I've described in the tech world. Nothing surprising, but still, why not self-publish? An editor and an artist will only run a few thousand dollars, a tiny investment compared to the time it takes to write a book, and whatever I lack in experience can be compensated for with giving a shit. To quote one of my co-founders, Jordan Andersen, it's only arrogant if you're wrong5. In the meantime though, I frequently find myself reflecting on how bizarre the knee-jerk "no swearing" rule was. Sure, there are always going to be some concessions to be made to marketing. I don't just label all my posts "Unnamed Post #7", because I would like to be read at least a little bit. But swearing? Who gives a shit? Is that really going to be the difference between a good book and a bad book? Why on earth would you hear that you've got someone interested in writing a book whose writing is doing millions of hits that very week and then immediately tell them that you know what will sell better than they will? In fact, the only other book they've got that's well-known enough for me to recognize it has swearing in it, so I know it isn't even a principled brand stance. A midwit just went "I am slightly self-conscious about how I appear to my boss" and that was enough to tank the whole thing. I will never stop citing Sturgeon's Law. Ninety percent of everything is crud. That is to say, ninety percent of everything is crud to a practitioner who has taken the time to develop judgement. That is to say there is some distribution of judgement and bravery, and a whole lot of people are clumped in one not-very-good batch. These days, when people become concerned about the seeming arrogance in that statement, I point them at real estate agents and say: "That's how bad many professionals are, but you can only tell when the issue is as blatant as a broken window in your living room." I still have not met a professional whose competence I've been able to verify that will not endorse something close to Sturgeon's Law. The best I've been able to manage is that, if you ignore all secondary attributes required for a job such as empathy, communication skills, maturity, and restrict yourself purely to the mechanical task at hand, some medical subspecialties are consistently okay... but with all those caveats, you'd still never want them to be your physician. In all fields, very weak practitioners seem to cling to a series of practices or principles without a nuanced understanding of why they're doing those things. Consider, for example, a junior engineer. The trajectory of the typical junior engineer is that they will hear a principle like Don't Repeat Yourself, and immediately begin writing functions to generalize two pieces of code that even look similar. This is normal and even admirable — it is a single-objective optimization problem, and they're optimizing! Junior engineers are supposed to be weak practitioners, but this person is trying. They will then become slightly more sophisticated, and learn about premature abstraction, and suddenly we have two principles that are in conflict. Collapsing duplicated code means you are Not Repeating Yourself, but you are probably introducing an abstraction, and now you have a tradeoff between two principles6. And if you keep going, you will pick up dozens to hundreds of these, implicit and explicit, and must become comfortable with the fact that you're going to have to balance them all simultaneously via the application of judgement, and you will be wrong sometimes. With all that nuance comes the boon and burden of being able to disregard principles. For example, we use Test Driven Development, but I was recently working on something that required spinning up a headless Chrome browser to convert a HTML document to a PDF. Unfortunately, this is very slow in a test suite and annoying in some CI/CD products for various reasons. Because I have an idea about why I test, and what the value of it is, and how likely this is to break, I made the decision to just not test that bit of the application when running tests in GitHub Actions. Will I regret that? Maybe, probably, but the point is that my rules are there for reasons and sometimes those reasons don't feel like they apply.7 Truly weak practitioners will come to you with totally degenerate rules or principles. This is the "no swearing" publisher, but it is also the "no dogs" landlord, the "no risk" security guy, the "must have ten years of Git experience" recruiter and I've no doubt that everyone reading this can think of at least one system where they've thought "I can't believe I'm at the mercy of a person that isn't even thinking". Frequently their rules are not even rules, they're just phrases that competent people used to say, and eventually they became well-known enough to become fake-able signal. Data-driven. Garbage in, garbage out. Agile. All of these may have previously signalled novel thought, and now anyone that's really savvy does their best to not use the phrases because they know how tacky it makes them look, even if they actually use them in meaningful ways. This can even happen when you've bypassed the large, visible, external gatekeepers, such as recruiters. All it takes is one person within an organization that loves talking and again lacks that baseline competency. One of my co-founders, Ash Lally, the infamous Business Jaguar8, was on a contract outside the context of our consultancy recently. They are tasked with pulling data from one system into another system, which is about the most boring and typical thing that a data engineer can do. The employer is not technologically advanced and this task is not their core competency, so as is the case for almost all work in this category, the solution is to schedule some code to run once every ten minutes to pull it in. They are working with someone that, to steal the words of a reader, has had a very impressive career in numeric terms, i.e, they're terrible at their job, but boy oh boy have they been doing it for a long time. Ash's counterpart considers pulling the data in every ten minutes, then comes back with: "Event-driven is good for internal system integration." Event-driven means that instead of writing something very simple to grab all new data every ten minutes, you instead write a very bespoke system that detects new events in real-time and copies it over to the target system. This is way more complicated and totally unsuitable for a company that hasn't figured out version control yet. And also totally unproductive, because the data can't be used without another piece of data which has a hard limit of being calculated... once every ten minutes. So the company still has a ten minute delay before anything can be used, plus all the insane overhead. But still, we should hear them out, why is event-driven good for system integration? I can think of some reasons, but I'll never know if they're the reasons this person had in mind, because that information is not forthcoming! They heard those words somewhere from someone authoritative-sounding and they now feel comfortable regurgitating them at other people. But we're going event-driven now! Bonus points, this infrastructure supports emergency services, so you can commit stochastic murder this way! It's like serial killing but you've tricked a whole department into being your co-conspirators! Even when you've passed all the normal gatekeepers, you will sometimes need permission to do the engineering equivalent of tying your shoelaces correctly.9 Above, I talk about people who have even gotten as far as misapplying principles. As frustrating as that is, that isn't even the worst you can do. Some people never reflect on their craft at all, or do not view it as a craft. The person that says "event-driven is good for internal systems integration" has at least taken a moment to read something, even if it's a terrible LinkedIn post or a Medium blog. Things can get so, so much worse. Remember all your peers at university that would say "I dream of working in HR"? No, probably not, because that sentence has possibly never been uttered in all of human existence. The field is laden to the point of breaking with people that drifted into it because it was the first job they could get that paid white-collar wages for a qualification no more sophisticated than knowing where some of the buttons are in Workday. Some of them, by dint of personality and ethics, are good at their jobs, but they are few and far between, and perhaps most importantly are not systematically produced. Is it actually a surprise, under those conditions, that HR seems to be useless whenever you interact with them? Could we expect any other outcome? It's a testament to the power that so many of them have relinquished to the economy, by dint of being unemployable on the grounds of technical skill or competence, that they bother to get out of bed at all. They don't want to be there any more than you want them there. Jordan, the same co-founder responsible for "it's only arrogant if you're wrong", wrote a single blog post on our company website. During a meeting where Jordan asked for some feedback, we spent some time caught up on this little snippet. I just want to pause and note how fucked this was. While I was an accredited allied health professional at the time, it's fucking ridiculous that a bunch of recreationists were put in charge of dictating how anyone should respond to a medical emergency... And here's what the team was split on — do we swear on the company blog? You can probably figure out where I set on the issue. Go for it! What are you, some sort of coward? But the team wasn't sure, and the truth is that I wasn't entirely sure either. Maybe I can get away with that on my personal blog, but is that too crass? I mean, some people feel it's already too crass here. Will people be scared to take us to their managers? And most importantly, other consultancies aren't doing this, should we be more like them? Eventually, Ricky Ling chimes in (I'm sorry there are so many of us), and his take for Jordan is the Quality-focused take. "If you think it makes the writing better, do it". We still aren't sure, but we know that we didn't quit our jobs and give up all that sweet, sweet salary to be cowards, so we do it. That single post has generated us a huge amount of outreach from cool people despite not going viral or being widely circulated as far as I know, and we almost started prematurely neutering it because a group of people who already deviate wildly were still worried about doing something even a little bit different. Being seen to deviate is extremely hard, in large part because to deviate is to be seen, and the gaze of others is deeply uncomfortable. There's an exercise that actors do, where they sit in two chairs opposite each other, make eye contact, and then one of them just starts saying things that they're feeling. "I am aware that my hands are warm." "I am aware that I am uncomfortable with you staring at me." "I am aware that I want to burst out laughing." This is very, very uncomfortable to do. I've done it three times, for about ten minutes each time, and I cannot emphasize how much we all hated it. From this we can infer that actors are total fucking weirdos, but also that acting as a field has identified that there is something deep to unpack in reflecting on what it is like to be perceived without the luxury of flinching or breaking eye contact. This aversion to deviation and subsequent perception is enough to make some people totally impotent. In the earlier days of the consultancy, I envisioned that our sales pipeline would be something like this: This sometimes does happen, but it has never happened at a company without a really spectacular culture. What happens at the average company or government agency is something to the effect of: "I am working on a project, and we're being scammed by some other consultants. The whole thing is months late, and it isn't going to finish any time soon. Is there any chance you can help out?" I reply, "Yeah, of course, we'd love to. But we'd need an introduction to someone inside the company who might be willing to admit that something is wrong." And this is where, every single time, the person that initially reached out has decided that they don't want to take the risk of being visible. I understand — a lowly engineer suggesting an external consultancy with hot takes is really, really unusual, especially so if they present hard-to-ignore and inconvenient evidence that a project is failing. It has possibly never happened to the average CTO across their entire career. The engineer would be as visible as it is possible to be, perhaps moreso than if they hauled off and punched someone in the face, and during the next round of layoffs they will either be promoted for being weird or fired for being weird. In either case, redundancy is no longer dependent on who is at the top of the list when the CFO sorts the salary column on a spreadsheet by descending. In the past year, I've seen people have huge impacts at companies by exerting some bravery. This sometimes means getting a bully fired, sometimes it means getting the first tech project to work smoothly in a decade. In some of these cases, the person involved was made redundant shortly afterwards for interfering with people's selfish political aims, and other times they were promoted for actually giving a damn (and yes, sometimes for unknowingly helping someone else's selfish political aims). But all of them went in willing to put something on the line. A huge number of employees will venture nothing for their beliefs, and while that is fine or whatever, bla bla bla, they have kids, they're also going to be largely ineffective because they won't change anything big, because big change is novel and weird, and novel and weird might get you noticed, and getting noticed means something is going to happen to you. Our company is really into weird stuff. Our favourite TTRPG is Burning Wheel, an extremely niche product, hundreds of pages long, whose creator refused to release a PDF for years because he felt that it watered down the experience. Our favourite traditional board game is Twilight Imperium, a sci-fi masterpiece that takes thirteen hours to play. For internal projects, we program Elixir, a language with near-zero name recognition amongst engineering genpop that compiles to Erlang, a language developed in the 80s by Ericsson of all places. We're an Extreme Programming shop. Most of my spend this year has been learning material and one-on-one coaching for engineers in the company. We started with six co-founders, something that caused several banks a great deal of consternation when we tried to open our account, and I am now realizing makes it very hard to write blog posts without introducing what must feel to a reader like an endless stream of new names. It gets stranger. We pair program on all work10. We have no network drive, just Git repositories where all documentation is written in Markdown, and the proposals that must go to clients are converted to HTML so we can style them with CSS. AI? Not only do we not turn on AI-assistance during programming, we'll crucify each other for copying a StackOverflow example if we can't explain the behaviour with reference to code or core documentation. We contracted Mira Welner this year, internet famous for frontpaging Hackernews a few times as a fresh grad, who described our work as "the opposite of vibe programming", which will make different people have wildly different opinions about whether we're competent. We invite our clients to sip from the Chalice of Madness, wherein we pray that they will find that the Kool-aid is delicious and refreshing, amen. If there is a conventional script for something, we have probably thrown it out the window or seriously considered it. I'm obviously convinced that these practices are good or I wouldn't be doing them, but they have a secondary characteristic that may be more valuable than their originally envisioned purpose. They filter out shoddy, default thinking, and otherwise shake people into vivid awareness. Everyone is constantly immersed in weirdness, and that makes the next piece of weirdness less scary. I mean, we may still fail as a business for many reasons, but it won't be because we weren't thinking, it'll be because we had stupid thoughts, which at least has the virtue of meaning we actually tried. If you had a company policy of "we only hire people that can pass an interview about Burning Wheel rules", I suspect you would hire a stronger team than what the average company manages. At least they'll have something in common and they've demonstrated refined taste in one area. I don't even care if they can program, they'll figure it out. Iroh: What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him? Zuko: First, I have to get it out of here. Iroh: And then what? You never think these things through! Some years ago, I knew a man that was laid up in hospital for a chronic illness. He was not having a good time, but it must be admitted that some of this bad time was the product of a long-running pattern of poor life decisions. C’est la vie. In any case, one day he is having a particularly bad day, and he messages me from the hospital. He's going to leave and pick up a pack of cigarettes. This perplexes me to no end. "But you don't smoke and are almost out of money, right?" And yes, it turns out I had not misremembered. He wanted to start smoking at that moment in time. Now, this is actually a fairly extraordinary amount of effort. Imagine, you're comfortable in a hospital bed, in a terrible mood, and all the normal pressures that lead to smoking are absent, such as peers to pressure you. But ex nihilo, you now grudgingly swing to your feet, fish out your last bit of money (cigarettes are supremely expensive in Australia, approximately a whopping USD $20 per pack), and march off to try and form a financially crippling addiction. Surely you have enough problems, and don't need to go through the trouble of leveraging your executive function to make more of them? After mulling this over for a while, I come to the realization that this fellow felt the need to inhabit the role of the hard-done-by man on the street. And what does the hard-done-by man do? Well, on the television or a play, he would light up a cigarette of course! Probably take a big, long drag off it, then close his eyes and exhale a stream of smoke into the sky as he sighs. It's real cool, yeah, he's a real cool dude. It's all symbolic, y'see? He's destroying his body as if to say "the world is wearing me down so quickly, the cigarettes won't have time to get me, heh". This is practically understandable, in a strange, catharsis-y way. We all know social scripts exist. There are rough guidelines on how much to tip a waiter in the U.S. In Australia, you should stand on the left side of an escalator if you're not intending to walk up it. What I hadn't really thought about was that some of them are so strong and latent that they can spontaneously cause a person to self-inflict a nicotine addiction. I hadn't even really noticed that I had an archetype of the put-upon smoker in my mind, but there it was, and you likely knew exactly what I was talking about. These scripts are adaptive in some situations — for example, well-adjusted men should be aware that the comradely arm on the shoulder is a great deal more appropriate with a male colleague than a female one, and an even better-adjusted person will just not touch their colleagues. But other scripts, especially the ones that are too small to think about or too large to see, drive insane life decisions. When I was studying psychology, almost everyone, including me, picked the course because we weren't sure what we wanted to do with our lives, but the script says finish high school and then take on ten of thousands of dollars in debt. That script is so large that it basically encompasses your whole upbringing. When you try to look at it, you see grey, and think "there is no elephant here, just a cement wall". Or when someone looks for a job they just start sending CVs out, even though that basically doesn't work at all. The assumption that this is how you get a job is so quiet that people don't even realize they're making a decision. They think the decision is whether you should have a one-page CV or a three-page CV, not whether they should have a CV at all. And again, when you interface with a sufficiently large system, they will have their own scripts, and you will be expected to abide by them. Your counterparty will usually unthinkingly apply them, and if you find someone that is willing to actually look at the situation at hand, treasure them. The other issue with going off-script, or otherwise deviating, is that you have to accept that you're going to look extremely silly if things don't work out. Someone, usually someone that isn't taking any risks themselves, will be a dick about it. Let's say that my company does well enough for me to draw a full tech-tier salary in 2026. I'll be praised for whatever I did differently. Six co-founders! My God, he's a genius! You can keep most of them working contract roles, which means your revenue requirements are low, but it only takes them about an hour a week to mobilize their networks for sales! His mind is a thousandfold blade, so keen is his thinking! Sure, now let's say that it collapses in June because a co-founder wants to pivot to a SaaS offering and I don't. Six co-founders! My God, what a fool! Everyone knows there are reasons that VCs prefer two to three founders and no more! A huge risk for a startup are the founders having a falling-out, and the risk increases exponentially with each node in the fully connected network! His mind is being passed around by stoned college grads, so blunt is his thinking! I can skip the embarrassment by doing what everyone else does. If I failed the normal and boring way, by running a non-Extreme Programming consultancy, with one co-founder, that writes Python because everyone else does, selling GenAI bullshit11, I would be beyond critique. I'd just say "Gosh golly, sales are hard", and everyone would nod sympathetically. Guess what though, whether or not people point and laugh, they certainly aren't going to pay your rent for you. Who gives a fuck about embarrassment? LaRusso: Do you think I stand a chance at the tournament? Miyagi: Not matter what Miyagi think. Miyagi not fighting. What most of this comes down to, fundamentally, is whether you trust your own judgement, what you're willing to stake on it, and whether that conviction is strong enough to throw away the guarantees that you'd get from conforming. Because you could take the guaranteed money for writing the book, and if you don't really believe that your judgement is superior, perhaps the money is worth it. Readers call me with some frequency to ask me if I think their startup idea is good. Could it sell? Would it work? Should I do it? How the hell would I know, I'm just some guy with a blog and a business that may explode in the next year. But if I were the owner of a $100M company, would I really know any better? If anyone knew, then when you asked them they would steal your idea. But no one knows, so the idea is safe and sound, and deep down the asker must be aware of this or they wouldn't be asking. Or take last week, when a student visited me from a local university to ask if they should drop out of university to run a startup. They really didn't like the idea of a corporate job, found university extremely tedious and their peers uninspired, so on, so forth. They were clearly very intelligent, but also clearly very young. What do you say there? Because the knee-jerk impulse, for fear of being irresponsible, is to say the boring thing without thinking about it. Finish your degree first. Get a few years of corporate experience. Or even, I know you're depressed, but don't quit your job without something else lined up. None of that is necessarily bad advice, but we should view ourselves with suspicion when we think about saying them, because they also absolve ourselves of guilt if things go awry. Who could blame us for giving the conservative line, even if you can easily play the tape forward and see it results in damnation? The advice that people are too scared to give, but which they sometimes really believe, with the usual caveats for a mental health event that has crippled the recipient's ability to see clearly: "What does it matter what I think? Do what you think is best for yourself, and yes, you might lose your life savings. What's the alternative, doing what other people say is best for the rest of your life?" Thank you for reading all the way through. For this kindness, I leave you with a parting gift. Penguin, what the fuck is going on over there? PS: Oh yeah, I put this in to justify writing, hire my nerds or whatever. Nassim Taleb calls this the "antilibrary", the collection of books that one owns that one has not yet read. Taleb argues that an antilibrary is there to educate and humble, while a library of already-read books has much of its usefulness shifted to signalling erudition. If you were to point out that the optimal antilibrary strategy is to constantly buy books and never read any, Taleb (and I) would call you a nerd. ↩ It was also a gift. Sorry Ricky, the Red Rising copy you got me alongside this was much better! ↩ It is endlessly entertaining to me that the cover of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book so desperately trying to be edgy, censors the the word fuck, achieving a flaccidity that goes beyond simply deciding not to swear at all. ↩ 100% of startup founders nodding at this. ↩ It is a custom that whenever I or Jordan call our shot and mess up, we call the other person and loudly declare "I was arrogant and wrong", then accept ruthless mockery. ↩ It is remarkable how many companies seem to forget that the ultimate value is arguably Working Software, and while all the subsidiary principles may fall out of Working Software when you shake it very hard, you can't do away with it. Why calculate velocity if you know you aren't shipping, scrumlords? ↩ The scary thing about messing with long-running, almost-mystical practices like testing is that their second-order effects run so deep that I get many benefits that I haven't even noticed, so making these decisions also means I may have thrown away some things I don't understand. It's like becoming convinced that I can leave a candle out of the summoning ritual. ↩ I am slowly realizing that my company is comprised entirely of fucking lunatics, and I am the cracked porcelain mask of sanity that attends sales calls. ↩ Our scathing disdain for this has not prevented us from chanting "event-driven is good for internal system integration" whenever we need to annoy Ash, which is probably not bullying. ↩ We incidentally allow anyone to pair program with us over a four hour session, where you can choose to be amazed at our great team energy, or if you'd prefer laugh at how bad we are at programming, so long as you'd consider writing a nice review if you have fun and see strong evidence of competence.

Title: Tariff Meltdown! Job Cuts! Empty Ports! Temu Customers Freaking Out!

Time Published: 2025-04-29T20:20:29Z
Full Content:
Tomorrow will be four weeks since Trump announced America’s LIBERATION DAY (from its wallets) with the biggest tariffs ever, now 145 percent tariffs on imports from China and a 10 percent minimum tax on all other countries. Has the phone from China rung yet with them begging with tears in their eyes to make a deal? I’m sure they’ll be calling any minute! Right after they get off the phone with Brazil to order up all of their soybeans. Contrary to what Trump told The Atlantic, he does not run the world. And like Wile E. Coyote off a cliff, we’re going down and have not quite reckoned with it or how bad it’s going to be, though pandemic-hardened consumers are stocking up, and purchases of canned goods, ketchup and instant coffee are up double digits. Subscribe But don’t you dare blame Donald J. Trump for the price hikes and empty shelves to come, ooh, that makes him mad! EARLIER TODAY! After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line item to orders imported from other countries, so consumers could see exactly how much these tariffs are fucking them over, a “pissed off” Trump freaked out and rang up Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. And The Beez immediately caved, even though Trump’s tariffs and the resulting stock market fuckery have already cost Bezos $109 million today, and about $68 billion since “Liberation Day.” But not supporting a candidate-lady who laughed, that is priceless. “Of course [Trump] was pissed,” an anonymous White House source told CNN. “Why should a multibillion dollar company pass off costs to consumers?” Because that is what a price is? BUT STOP TARIFFING YOURSELF, JEFF! And then Karoline Leavitt fumed about it, because fuming is her only emotion. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon. Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Then she accused Amazon of being partnered with a “Chinese propaganda arm.” Eesh, why did Trump take a million dollars from him for that “inauguration” fund, then? The guy should really be more thoughtful about who he hangs out with! And hold up, is she admitting that tariffs make things more expensive?! One company that is adding a tariff line item, Temu. The “Temu Things” subreddit is in full meltdown with consumers pointing out a line with massive “import charges” on their invoices. Getting rid of the de minimis tariff exemption for packages under $800 is going to have another side effect too; somebody’s got to collect all of those tariffs on polyester shirts and whatnot, and inspect packages to make sure nobody’s claiming their shirt is a shawl from grandma, or something. Are the ports staffed with enough Customs workers to take that on, or is everybody’s package just going to get stuck there for months? We shall see! Meanwhile, it seems like empty shelves are going to be a future reality. At the Port of Los Angeles, the main point of entry for cargo ships from China and Southeast Asia, the executive director says shipments are expected to sink 35 percent next week. In Washington state, the Northwest Seaport Alliance saw an increase in March as retailers stocked up in anticipation, and now ships are coming in with 30 percent less cargo. And ships are going out and turning around and coming back, then just sitting in dock waiting with their soybeans or whatever, because orders are being cancelled. And now UPS says it will cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities in expectation that Amazon shipments will be cut in half. Trucking volumes are already down, and Mack Trucks and Volvo Trucks are laying off hundreds of workers. Outlook not good for the stevedores, either, with all those cargo ships buying one-way tickets to Palookaville! Trump bragged to Time Magazine that he has made “200 deals,” SECRET deals, MANY deals, and he’ll tell everybody about them soon, though, and Peter Navarro said there would be 90 deals in 90 days. But here we are at day 27, still nobody is saying with whom these big beautiful deals were made! If China is talking to anybody (and they say they’re not), it’s not buffoon Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. But “uh, maybe they’ll call me one day,” he told Fox News. Sure they will. Maybe Beyonce will, too! And he just knows they’ll come crawling back real soon, because we buy “five times more” stuff from them than they buy from us. Is he sure we don’t need some of that stuff though? The US relies on China for as much as 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 90 percent of generic antibiotics. And more than 90 percent of the medical gear worn by American health care workers. Guess it’s back to those pandemic garbage-bag outfits! And now with the uncertainty, PPE manufacturers and drug companies like Pfizer say they will not invest in research and development in the US, and can’t really blame them. Earlier today That Man did back down from part of his automotive tariffs, so that car importers already paying a tariff on the car will now not ALSO be paying a tariff on the steel and aluminum, and can get a rebate for any double-tariffs they paid. So benevolent, and how well-thought-out this rollout was! Meanwhile, Rand Paul and the Democrats are expected to vote this week on revoking Trump’s self-bestowed emergency tariff powers. Trump will just veto it, of course, but as layoffs, empty shelves, and furious constituents pile up, maybe two-thirds of the House and Senate will grow some spines and override him? (Why you need two-thirds to override a presidential veto of Congress vetoing the president seizing Congress’s specifically enumerated taxing power is just one of those funny things!) We can dream! Now if you’ll excuse us, we are off to order 10 tubes of Japanese sunscreen and several restaurant-sized jars of Lao Gan Ma chili crisp, and maybe some K95 masks for the plague to come, and re-watch On The Waterfront.

Title: UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs. It’s not what you think | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: UPS will cut 20,000 jobs this year, about 4% of its global workforce, the company said Tuesday. But UPS added the decision is unrelated to tariffs and is instead due to increased use of technology and a previously announced plan to trim its Amazon business. UPS in January announced a “glide down” plan to cut its business with Amazon, its largest customer, in half by the middle of 2026. UPS CEO Carol Tome said Tuesday that most of the Amazon business that it is giving up is “not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network.” The UPS package volume from Amazon was already down 16% in the just-completed quarter, which was a bigger drop than UPS had forecast for the period. UPS said it will close 73 US buildings by the end of June as the next part of that “glide down” plan. UPS also said it expects to use more automation in its facilities, from sorting packages to label application to loading and unloading trucks, with 400 facilities becoming partly if not fully automated. “With this reconfiguration, we will also lessen our dependency on labor,” she said. The Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS hourly workers, said it would fight layoffs of any of its members. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way,” said the union’s president, Sean O’Brien. “But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” In response, UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the company intends to live up to all the terms of its contract. UPS did see some effects from Trump’s broad tariffs of 10% on most imports, though, especially the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. But the company is still uncertain about the ultimate effects. Tome said customers that do a lot of business with China are “not thinking about exiting the business.” But she also said that many of them don’t know exactly what their next step will be. Many are still hoping for a tariff roll-back. “Candidly, there’s so much uncertainty around the China orders,” she said. “We know what’s been announced. We don’t know actually if it will happen, and we don’t know if it will stick. We think there are many things we don’t know.” UPS does believe its customers will feel an impact from the tariffs, and because of that, and the pull-back from Amazon, it forecast its own revenue will fall in the second quarter compared to a year ago. But it said it is not ready to drop its own full-year guidance, although it warned it could adjust that in the future as well. “There’s so much uncertainty in the back half (of the year), because all those (tariffs) will ultimately impact the US consumer,” she said. “Current consumer sentiment is down from where it was at the beginning of the year. (But) the consumer is still pretty healthy.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Title: Karoline Leavitt’s Angry New Attack on Amazon Reveals Trump’s Weakness
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/194561/trump-angry-attack-amazon-tariffs
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:14:10Z

Well, that was fast. On Tuesday morning—after the news broke that Amazon was supposedly planning to display the costs that President Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of products—White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a dark warning. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” Leavitt told reporters, pointedly noting that she had just heard this message straight from the Big Man himself. Less than two hours later, Amazon put out a statement clarifying that this idea was only considered in a small corner of its sprawling online retail empire and “was never a consideration for the main Amazon site.” You might be tempted to see this as another sign of Trump’s fearsome strength: He merely hinted at unleashing the power of the government on Amazon, a company worth $2 trillion, and it immediately fell into line, right? Naah. This little saga is better seen as highly revealing of Trump’s weakness right now, both on tariffs specifically and more generally. The last thing that Trump and his propagandists can tolerate is the spectacle of voters being told basic facts about his tariffs. Which puts Trump at the mercy of those who will tell the truth about them. Leavitt’s broadside against Amazon is telling in this regard. First, watch the whole thing, courtesy of Aaron Rupar: REPORTER: Amazon will soon display a number next to the price of each product that shows how much the Trump tariffs are adding. Isn't that a perfect demonstration that it's the American consumer who is paying for these policies?LEAVITT: This is a hostile and political act by… pic.twitter.com/oewT08hBSH Note that Leavitt didn’t answer the second half of the reporter’s question. Isn’t the idea that Amazon might label the cost of tariffs, the reporter asked, a “crystal clear demonstration” that the American consumer, and not China, will have to “pay for these policies”? Leavitt unloaded aggressively in response, describing this as a “hostile” act, not once but twice—signaling that Trump would view this as meriting “hostile” action by the government in return. That may have gotten short-term results: Whatever Amazon’s original intentions, it did quickly announce a stand-down. But the careful observer will notice a problem with Leavitt’s approach. It’s that people are still going to have to pay higher prices for these tariffs on an enormous range of consumer products, whether Amazon labels them as such or not. And the ability of the White House to manage this problem—either by browbeating the private sector into not raising prices or by flooding Americans with propaganda about how “other countries” are the ones paying the tariffs in a much-needed global rebalancing—is actually quite limited. Recall that during a private call with the CEOs of big automakers last month, Trump darkly warned that they’d better not raise prices in response to his tariffs. The White House will look unfavorably on any companies that do this, he suggested, leaving them fearing retribution. Amusingly, all this really did was reveal that Trump himself knows that importers and domestic manufacturers using imported parts—and not “other countries”—are the ones who will pay the tariffs. Since then, there have been no indications that automakers will be bullied into swallowing the costs of Trump’s tariffs. Indeed, the White House just announced some tariff relief for them, an apparent backing down. Meanwhile, out in the real world, the impacts of Trump’s tariffs are already glaringly obvious. A dozen top retailers, including Shein and Target, announced just this week that Trump’s tariffs are translating into higher prices. Shipments to the port of Los Angeles are starting to dry up. Layoffs are beginning to hit, including deep in MAGA country. Trump’s spinners have boundless faith in their power to recast the battle over tariffs as one allying him with regular people against corporate elites. This was clearly the calculation behind the Trump-Leavitt effort to pick a public fight with Amazon over the possibility that the company might be too truthful with consumers about them. But the tariffs, as an issue, are uniquely positioned to cut through that kind of agitprop, and a new poll from CNN demonstrates why. It finds that a whopping 60 percent of Americans now say Trump’s policies have already increased the cost of living and 55 percent say his tariffs are “bad policy.” What’s remarkable, though, is that large percentages of working-class respondents also view the tariffs dimly. The numbers among non-college voters—a standard metric of class—are striking: 57 percent say Trump’s measures have already increased the cost of living; 50 percent say the tariffs are bad policy; 55 percent say he doesn’t have a clear strategy with them; 69 percent say they’ll hurt the economy in the short term; and 50 percent say they’ll hurt it over the long term. In short, Trump’s propagandists cannot easily polarize the tariffs along elite versus non-elite lines. And as that last data point suggests, there’s no sign that working-class voters see a need for the massive rebalancing—via an unwinding of globalization—that Trump keeps insisting we need. This is why you see opposition brewing even in deep-red places like Texas. People think Trump’s tariffs are bad, full stop, because they see it with their own eyes. And it isn’t just that they fear higher prices in the immediate term. It’s also that they view the superficial nationalist project underlying them dimly as well. So there’s an opening here for others to step into the breach that Amazon left by announcing it will not inform consumers about tariffs’ actual costs. Why can’t other retailers—ones large and small, ones not easily cowed by Trump—run with the idea? Why not do Amazon one better and explicitly label the additional costs heaped on consumer goods as the direct result of Trump’s tariffs? Slap his name right on those added costs, just as Trump put his name on those 2020 stimulus checks. OK, I get that this idea might run into some practical difficulties. Smaller retailers can’t inform all that many consumers with a move like this. But it’s the sort of thing that could generate a little cultural boomlet if it got going. It might spread. Companies that don’t fear MAGA boycotts—or want to bond with anti-Trump customer bases—might have a little fun and get creative. Just look how infuriated Trump grew at the prospect of one company—admittedly a giant and influential one, but still—telling consumers the truth about his policies. The wildly disproportionate response to Amazon from Trump and Leavitt wasn’t a sign of strength and power. It was a display of deep, enduring weakness, just waiting to be exploited.

Title: UPS layoffs: Package delivery company to cut 20,000 jobs, close 73 facilities as it reduces amount of Amazon shipments it handles

UPS is looking to slash about 20,000 jobs and close more than 70 facilities as it drastically reduces the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. The package delivery company said Tuesday that it anticipates making the job cuts this year. It anticipates closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June. UPS said that it is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." In January UPS announced that it had reached a deal with Amazon, its biggest customer, to lower its volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. During UPS' fourth-quarter earnings conference call in January, Tomé said that the company had partnered with Amazon for almost 30 years and that when its contract came up this year, UPS decided to reassess the relationship. "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer," Tomé said at the time. "Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Tomé said that UPS considered various options and determined that the volume reduction was the best alternative. The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday. The Atlanta-based company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That's better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn't providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Shares of UPS rose slightly in morning trading.

UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs and closing some facilities as the delivery company reduces the amount of Amazon packages it handles. The company said it plans to conduct the layoffs before the end of the year and close 73 facilities in buildings it owns or leases by the end of June — with more closings to possibly to come at a later date. “The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” UPS and Amazon earlier this year agreed to pare back their shared business by more than 50%. “Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer,” Tomé said at the time. Their output of 24 million packages a day on average (about 5.7 billion a year) represents about a quarter of all shipments in the U.S., according to the global shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes. The company has about 490,000 employees and operates in over 200 countries. It previously announced it was cutting 12,000 jobs in 2024. UPS and the Teamsters Union avoided a strike in 2023 and signed a five-year contract. Trump administration tariffs have already slowed down trade and led to cost cutting ahead of an anticipated drop in demand. The company recently unveiled its “Global Checkout” feature that tells customers upfront what they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.

A UPS tractor-trailer parked at a loading dock. The Atlanta-based shipping giant revealed the job cuts in a regulatory filing on Tuesday, April 29. UPS also plans to close 73 buildings by June as the company aims to save $3.5 billion by the end of 2025. CEO Carol Tomé said UPS is working to adapt to more difficult economic conditions for shippers due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. "As a trusted leader in global logistics, we will leverage our integrated network and trade expertise to assist our customers as they adapt to a changing trade environment," said Tomé. "Further, the actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." The layoffs came after UPS also laid off about 12,000 workers throughout 2024. UPS reported first-quarter 2025 revenues of $21.5 billion, down 0.7% from the previous first quarter. The move comes as UPS faces shifting demand and prepares for a sharp drop in deliveries from Amazon, CBS News reported. In January, UPS said it had reached an agreement to cut Amazon delivery volumes by more than 50% in the second half of 2026. "The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability," a UPS spokesperson told CBS. Amazon said it had offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company decided to pull back. "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision," an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to CBS. Customers can track how Trump's tariffs will impact UPS on its website. The company also has the "UPS Global Checkout" tool, showing upfront costs for duties, taxes, and fees.

Title: White House Panics After Report Claims Amazon Will Display Tariff Prices

Time Published: 2025-04-29T17:16:07Z

White House officials held a press conference Tuesday morning to talk about the economy, as Americans get extremely nervous about the tariffs on China that are starting to cause prices to rise. And while Trump’s goons put on a brave face, it was clear they’re in panic mode. In fact, one question about Amazon really got them flustered. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted things were all going according to plan, even though Americans are starting to see 145% surcharges added to their shipments from Chinese retailers like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress. But when a reporter asked about a report from Punchbowl on Tuesday that Amazon would be listing tariff costs when consumers check out, Leavitt flipped her lid. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,â said Leavitt. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Amazon probably didn’t add an “inflation” surcharge during the Biden years because that’s not a real thing that any normal person thinks of doing. But it’s very easy to add a tariff line because we know exactly how much that is going to cost consumers. In the case of Trump’s 145% tariff on goods from China, it’s going to be 145%. Leavitt went on to hold up a printout of a Reuters article from 2021 titled “Amazon Partnered With China Propaganda Arm.” The article notes that Amazon was marketing a collection of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings on its online store in China about two years earlier. The crux of the story is that Amazon disabled reviews in the country after Chinese officials complained about negative reviews and added a page called China Books that promoted materials favorable to the government. Leavitt didn’t really provide any context for why she was talking about this story from years earlier, but clearly intended for the headline to be damning in its insinuations about collaboration with the Chinese government. But it looks like that report about Amazon listing tariffs wasn’t true. Or, at least things changed after the story broke. Reached for comment on Tuesday after the White House press conference, Amazon told Gizmodo that it won’t actually be adding a tariff line item to purchases. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. CNN reports that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after the Punchbowl news story landed Tuesday morning. A White House official told CNN that Trump was “pissed” adding “Why should a multi-billion-dollar company pass off costs to consumers?” Well, that part seems obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of economics. If the cost of importing goods is going up 145%, Amazon isn’t going to just eat that entire charge. They’re going to raise prices for consumers. White House advisor Stephen Miller was asked about the Amazon pricing controversy on Fox News and tried to play it off like as no big deal. “I’ll just take Amazon’s statement at face value, which is that they said this is an idea that had been discussed, was not being actioned, and now we can take heart in knowing that they formally rejected the idea,” Miller said. Miller was then asked about whether Trump had indeed called Bezos and the White House advisor laughed it off, insisting that things worked out just fine in the end. ROBERTS: I understand there might’ve been a phone call from the president to Jeff Bezos on this this morning STEPHEN MILLER: I have no news to add on it. All I can say is things worked out exactly as they should. [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) April 29, 2025 at 10:12 AM Trump later confirmed that he had spoken with Bezos earlier in the day, saying, “Jeff Bezos was very nice, he was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump said about calling the Amazon founder regarding tariff prices being added to the site. “He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” [image or embed] â Matt Novak (@paleofuture.bsky.social) April 29, 2025 at 12:23 PM The consumer confidence index fell this month for the fifth straight month in a row, according to the Associated Press. And if you take a quick look at the calendar, five months ago was November, the same month Trump was elected. Bessent was asked Tuesday about supply chains that are expected to break down in the coming weeks, as ships from China have basically stopped leaving for U.S. ports. But the Treasury Secretary insisted that everything would be fine since he imagined businesses have already planned ahead for any disruptions. “I wouldn’t think that we would have supply chain shocks,” said Bessent. “And I think retailers that have managed their inventory in front of this. I speak to dozens of companies sometimes daily, but definitely weekly, and they know that President Trump is committed to fair trade and have planned accordingly.” Bessent has made this same argument repeatedly in recent days. He asserts that there won’t actually be supply chain shocks because every business knew this was coming and should’ve planned appropriately. That argument ignores the fact that it’s difficult to just find a new supplier for inexpensive Chinese goods in less than a month, if you’re able to do that at all by some miracle. Adidas warned Tuesday it would soon be raising prices on goods for Americans. And some companies are already doing layoffs over the economic situation, with shipping company UPS announcing Tuesday it was cutting 20,000 jobs from its 490,000-person workforce. The company said in a regulatory filing that it was “in connection with our anticipation of lower volumes” from Amazon, the company’s largest customer. Trump has claimed that he’s signing new trade deals with every country, given the fact that even America’s closest allies have been hit with a 10% tariff. But there’s scant evidence that any trade deal is anywhere close to being completed. Bessent keeps teasing the idea that deals are almost done with Japan and India, but the timing on when those could be done isn’t clear at all. Trump has also said he’s negotiating with China, but that doesn’t seem to be true either. âLet me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,â Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday, according to CNBC. Fox News, Trump’s favorite TV channel, has done its best to sell the idea that these tariffs are good, but even there, we’re starting to see some dissent. Dana Perino, a host on the network and former press secretary for the White House under George W. Bush, said on Tuesday that she doesn’t like tariffs and is worried about how small businesses are going to do under them. “I think that it’s one thing as a consumer to say I will be able to accept the pain,” Perino said. “But the small- and medium-sized business owner, who right now are looking at the possibility of losing everything that they’ve worked for in the next four to six weeks, is very real.” There’s understandably been a fixation on tariffs this week, as Americans are starting to learn about how they will soon pay more for just about everything. But Trump is also working hard to make the United States an unlivable hellhole in other ways. The president’s regime is terrorizing immigrant communities, jailing political dissidents like Rumeysa Ozturk, who did nothing more than write an op-ed against the war in Gaza, and kicking pediatric cancer patients out of the country without their medications. Trump’s FBI also arrested a judge in Wisconsin last week for allegedly not doing enough to help ICE detain an immigrant in her courtroom. And the president signed an executive order on Monday that experts warn will further militarize American police. A recent poll from PRRI shows that 52% of Americans agree with the statement that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” The president’s approval rating is in the toilet, and Trump’s right-hand oligarch, Elon Musk, is getting similar marks, with just 35% of Americans approving of his obliteration of the government with DOGE. Yes, Trump is hurting everything good about America. But at least everything’s going to be much more expensive soon. America truly shot itself in the foot by electing Trump again.

"Elon is so terrific," the president told graduates at the University of Alabama. "Are you ready for this, media?" the attorney general asked, but what followed was a heaping pile of horsecrap about a very serious subject. Laura Loomer appeared to take credit for the ouster. President Trump said, "Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls." Thetrilliondollardinner.gov, DinnerForAmerica.gov, and TheTrillion.Gov were all registered recently.

The United Parcel Service (UPS) is expected to reduce its workforce by roughly 20,000 during 2025, citing "new or increased tariffs" and "changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally" for the cuts. UPS announced the layoffs April 29 in its first quarter earnings report, in which the parcel delivery service said it made consolidated revenues of $21.5 billion, compared to $21.7 billion around the same time a year ago. The shipping company also said it would be closing roughly 164 facilities by the end of the year. Consolidation efforts for UPS come as President Donald Trump's looming tariffs continue to impact U.S. and global trade, as companies across the country are reducing costs in preparation for a possible economic fallout. In 2024, UPS employed around 490,000 people worldwide, including about 330,000 Teamsters-represented jobs in the U.S. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," Carol Tomé, UPS's chief executive officer, said in the report. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” For UPS specifically, it cautioned in January that it was expediting its plan to reduce millions of deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com, which accounted for 11.8% of its overall revenue in 2024, CNBC reported. “We are reducing the amount of volume we deliver for Amazon by more than 50% by June 2026," Brian Dykes, UPS' chief financial officer, said in a statement to USA TODAY. "Associated with this volume reduction, we are undertaking the largest network reconfiguration in our history. This effort has been combined with our Network of the Future initiative as both will help drive us to a more efficient network." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt lashed out at Amazon after a report said the e-commerce giant was planning to list the costs of Trump's tariffs next to the total prices of products, which Leavitt called "a hostile and political act" while speaking to reporters on April 29. According to Dyke, UPS's "planned reductions are in line with the total Amazon volume decline.” In addition to the position cuts, UPS said it plans to close 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June 2025, according to the earnings report. Dyke said the total number of operational closures by the end of the year is expected to be 164. The closures will consist of facilities that are part of UPS' U.S. Ground operation, where packages are unloaded, sorted and loaded, a spokesperson told USA TODAY. "We are continuing to review our network and may identify additional buildings for closure," the Atlanta-based parcel delivery service said. The job cuts and building closures are expected to save UPS $3.5 billion in 2025, the earnings report says. UPS' consolidation and cost-saving initiative, "Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined," is expected to end in 2027, according to the parcel delivery service. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery firm, forecasted in January a full-year revenue of $89 billion, CNBC reported. In January 2024, UPS announced the layoffs of nearly 12,000 employees across the globe to "align resources for 2024." During a company earnings call at the time, Tomé said the cuts would save the company nearly $1 billion. His comments came after UPS underwent a massive year-over-year decline in revenue. “I want to thank UPSers for providing the best on-time performance of any carrier for the sixth year in a row,” Tomé said in a statement released by the company in 2024. “2023 was a unique and difficult year and through it all we remained focused on controlling what we could control, stayed on strategy and strengthened our foundation for future growth.”

Title: UPS Slashes 20,000 Jobs as it Weans Off Amazon

By Glenn Taylor UPS is cutting 20,000 jobs this year, or 4 percent of its total workforce, as the package delivery giant powers through its decoupling with Amazon. The courier’s layoffs are a side effect of the company’s Network of the Future plan, which is intended to make UPS more reliant on automated processes within warehouses and consolidate sorting facilities. Along with the 20,000 job closures, 73 leased and owned buildings will be shuttered by June. The company anticipates $3.5 billion of total cost savings through these measures. During a Tuesday earnings call, Brian Dykes, chief financial officer at UPS, said the reconfiguration is aligned with the anticipated Amazon volume reduction across 2025. UPS had already expected to cut volume it moves for Amazon by 50 percent by the 2026 second half. In the first quarter, Amazon average daily volume (ADV) decreased 16 percent year over year, “which was more than we originally planned,” according to Dykes. Second quarter ADV is projected to have the same decline. The back half of 2025 should see steeper declines of roughly 30 percent in each quarter. Amazon accounted for 11.8 percent of UPS revenue in 2024, but the latter has looked to wean off the e-commerce giant as the partnership has weighed on profit margins. Related Stories Topics Amazon CEO: Tariffs Haven't Brought Down Demand...Yet Topics Tariff Ticker: Congressional Effort to Stop Duties Struck Down, Chamber of Commerce Demands Exemptions For the first quarter, UPS generated $21.5 billion in revenue, a 0.7 percent decrease from the year-ago period and had a net income of $1.2 billion, up 7 percent from $1.1 billion in the year prior. Domestic daily volume slipped 3.5 percent to 17.4 million packages, dragging down the overall worldwide package volume to a 1.9 percent dip to 20.8 million parcels. “While volume and revenue performance in the quarter were in line with our expectations, our monthly performance was not,” said Dykes. “In U.S. domestic, following a strong January relative to our expectations, uncertainty in the market began impacting consumer behavior. Demand shifted down in February, falling further than our expectations and normal shipping patterns and remained at that level in March.” Like many public companies navigating the current geopolitical environment, UPS is not providing a full-year guidance. During the call, UPS said the business is expected to generate $21 billion in revenue and in operating margin of about 9.3 percent in the second quarter. That would be a 3.7 percent decline from the $21.8 billion brought in during the year prior, but above last year’s 8.9 percent margin. However, the uncertainty related to the tariffs levied by the Trump administration is expected to bring ADVs down 9 percent in the U.S. domestic business, with domestic revenue anticipated to dip in the low-single digits. SMBs will be “disproportionally impacted,” Dykes said. “Many of our SMBs as we talk to them are 100-percent single sourced from China,” said CEO Carol Tomé in the call, citing the 145-percent tariff on Chinese imports and the elimination of the de minimis exemption. “Our SMBs who don’t have the working capital capabilities to pull forward inventory are saying, ‘how are we going to handle this cost increase that’s coming our way?’” Tomé noted that these businesses are seeking alternate forms of supply, and working with original equipment manufacturers trying to move to other countries. However, she acknowledged “the large companies get to take the first phone call.” While UPS exposure to China is roughly 400,000 imported packages per day, or less than 2 percent of total global ADV, revenue on the China-to-U.S. trade lane was 11 percent of total international revenue. “Our China to U.S. trade lanes are our most profitable trade lanes,” said Tomé, who noted that the courier has had ongoing discussions with its top 100 customers to understand the impacts of Trump’s trade policy. “These customers have told us that they are exploring various options to address the tariff from absorbing the cost to pushing them into retail prices to asking suppliers to help defray the expense.” On the call, Dykes also said UPS is evaluating approximately 50 more warehouses to close as it continues its network consolidation. Sixty-four percent of UPS volume now goes through an automated hub—up 4.5 percentage points from the year prior, according to Dykes. The earnings report came a day after Bloomberg said UPS was in talks to partner with robotics startup Figure AI to use humanoid robots within its warehousing network, which would further the focus on automation and put more jobs in doubt. “There’s much more to automation than just automating the sort,” said Tomé, who didn’t confirm the partnership. “We’re also looking at the use of robotics for automatic label application and many other automatic opportunities like unloading and loading trailers.” Nando Cesarone, president U.S. at UPS, reiterated that the end goal is to have 400 fully or semi-automated warehouses, with 200 facilities expected to be shuttered by 2028. “We’re working ahead of ourselves as new automation technology—the application of AI in certain areas to help us with labor—is introduced into these operations, and that allows us to really take cost out of the network,” Cesarone said. “The end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor.” As of the company’s annual report released in March, UPS had 490,000 total employees, excluding temporary seasonal employees. More than 75 percent of the 406,000 U.S. employees are unionized, represented by either the Teamsters or the Independent Pilots Association. “United Parcel Service is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement,” said Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien in a statement. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” Stock price has been largely unaffected by the layoffs, inching down 0.4 percent by noon Tuesday.

UPS is looking to slash about 20,000 jobs and close more than 70 facilities as it drastically reduces the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. The package delivery company said Tuesday that it anticipates making the job cuts this year. It anticipates closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June. UPS said that it is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." In January UPS announced that it had reached a deal with Amazon, its biggest customer, to lower its volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. During UPS' fourth-quarter earnings conference call in January, Tomé said that the company had partnered with Amazon for almost 30 years and that when its contract came up this year, UPS decided to reassess the relationship. "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer," Tomé said at the time. "Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Tomé said that UPS considered various options and determined that the volume reduction was the best alternative. The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday. The Atlanta-based company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That's better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn't providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Shares of UPS rose slightly in morning trading.

WSOC Now Shipping giant UPS announced on Tuesday that it will be cutting 20,000 jobs to cut costs. The announcement was made during UPS’s earnings call, Reuters reported. One reason given was fewer deliveries from Amazon. UPS announced in January that it planned to cut the number of Amazon packages by more than half over the next year and a half. “Amazon is our largest customer, but it’s not our most profitable customer,” CEO Carol Tomé said in January, according to The Associated Press. “Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.” The layoffs will affect about 4% of the 490,000-member workforce, CBS News reported. The cuts will come from the operational workforce, which, according to Bloomberg, includes delivery drivers and package handlers. The company will also close 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June, with more locations possibly closing. The layoffs and the closures will save an estimated $3.5 billion this year for UPS. “The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tomé said, according to the AP. “The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.” Amazon said it will continue to partner with UPS and other carriers. Amazon and UPS had been partners for nearly 30 years as of January, the AP reported. Last year, UPS cut 12,000 management jobs, Bloomberg reported. ©2025 Cox Media Group © 2025 Cox Media Group.

Amazon and UPS had been partners for nearly 30 years as of January, the AP reported. Last year, UPS cut 12,000 management jobs, Bloomberg reported. In January, UPS said they'd be reducing the number of Amazon deliveries they perform by 50% through 2026. Amazon is currently the shipping company's largest customer. UPS CEO Carol B. Tomé said at the time that the company planned to make more changes so they'd be more profitable, going forward. “We are making business and operational changes that, along with the foundational changes we’ve already made, will put us further down the path to becoming a more profitable, agile and differentiated UPS that is growing in the best parts of the market,” Tomé said in a statement. With Tuesday's earnings call, it appears the plan to change now includes mass layoffs. A check of the Georgia WARN Notice portal, a federally required tracker for layoffs, does not yet show any UPS facilities in the state. Channel 2 Action News requested a more detailed list of where positions and facilities would close was requested from UPS. ©2025 Cox Media Group © 2025 Cox Media Group.

UPS expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 after cutting 20,000 jobs and closing 73 leased and owned buildings by the end of June, the company announced in its first-quarter earnings report. The layoffs and building closures follow what UPS said is “anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer,” Amazon, which UPS announced in January would have its shipping volume with the company cut in half by 2026. UPS—whose shares rose about 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday—reported first-quarter revenue of $21.5 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, beating analyst expectations of $21.05 billion and $1.38, according to FactSet.

The latest layoffs at UPS follow the company’s announcement in January it would cut most of its business with Amazon. At the time, UPS projected a decline in revenue for 2025 as CEO Carol Tome said it was “time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship” with Amazon. The company’s decision to reduce shipment volume from Amazon will allow UPS to expand its profit margins, Tome said in the company’s 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call. “Amazon is our largest customer, but it’s not our most profitable customer,” Tome said. UPS announced in January 2024 the company would cut 12,000 employees, after Tome said UPS experienced a “difficult and disappointing” 2023.

UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by mid-2025 as part of a cost-saving strategy amid economic uncertainty and reduced Amazon deliveries. The company is shifting away from lower-margin Amazon shipments (12% of revenue) to focus on more profitable sectors like healthcare and international deliveries. UPS expects $3.5 billion in savings by 2025, aiming to boost operating margins despite economic pressures from tariffs and slowing trade demand. First-quarter revenue ($21.5B) beat expectations, but UPS declined to update its full-year outlook due to unpredictable market conditions. Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble."

Most layoffs will impact non-union management as UPS restructures its workforce and network, attempting to emerge "stronger and more nimble." In a significant restructuring move, UPS announced plans on Tuesday to eliminate 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by June 2025. This aggressive cost-cutting strategy is being driven by its decision to reduce deliveries for Amazon and navigate an uncertain economic landscape. The layoffs will impact just over 4% of UPS's 490,000-strong workforce and follow last year's cut of 12,000 positions. Strategic pivot from Amazon The job cuts come after UPS's January decision to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it handles. While Amazon deliveries constitute approximately 12% of UPS's revenue, the company determined that profit margins from these shipments were too small and is now refocusing on more lucrative markets such as healthcare and international deliveries. During UPS's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CEO Carol TomÃ© explained the rationale: "Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business." Amazon maintains that it has a "strong working relationship" with UPS. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, noted that Amazon had actually "offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments." Nantel added, "Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision. We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers." Economic uncertainty and cost savings TomÃ© cited the uncertain economic environment as another factor in the company's restructuring: "The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years," she stated during Tuesday's earnings call. The company expects to save $3.5 billion in 2025 through these cost-cutting measures. "These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability," CFO Brian Dykes explained during the earnings call. Economic headwinds include extensive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that have slowed trade and led companies to reduce costs in anticipation of reduced demand. For delivery companies like UPS, this slowdown likely means decreased demand for shipping services between businesses. UPS is keeping customers informed about tariff developments on its website and has introduced a tool called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs for duties, fees and taxes. Financial performance and outlook Despite these challenges, UPS reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday, with revenue of $21.5 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $21.05 billion. The company posted an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, ahead of analysts' expectations of $1.38. "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," said CEO TomÃ©. However, UPS declined to provide any updates to its full-year outlook due to economic uncertainty. UPS had previously announced its expectation for 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. Of UPS's 490,000 employees, around 330,000 are represented by the Teamsters union. The company is consolidating its facilities and workforce as it prepares for reduced Amazon shipments. UPS may identify additional buildings for closure as it continues to review its network. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," TomÃ© stated. Last year, UPS delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year. Whether the company can maintain its dominance while shedding jobs and facilities remains to be seen.

"The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS," TomÃ© stated.

Title: What’s The Vibe In The U.S. Tech Sector

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind. The BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, signaling growth, especially in AI and fintech, where financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022. US tech professionals are drawn to companies like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, and Netflix for their innovation, competitive pay, and supportive cultures. These employers offer the chance to work on transformative technologies, grow professionally, and enjoy flexible, inclusive workplaces. Tech workers rank companies like Oracle, Amazon, and FIS Global highly, per Forbes’ 2024 Best Employers for Tech Workers, based on about 25,000 surveyed employees. Oracle’s supportive culture and Amazon’s mentorship programs shine, offering competitive pay, $142,000–$210,000 along with generous bonuses, stock options, and growth. Robert Half’s 2025 Salary Guide notes only 41% of tech workers are satisfied with pay, averaging $112,521, though AI-skilled professionals earn a 17.7% premium. A Dice report highlights 47% of tech workers are actively seeking new roles, driven by underpayment or lack of flexibility. Layoffs make job searches tougher. Still, over 7 million job postings in 2025, a 33% jump, per Dice, show opportunities persist for skilled candidates. AI engineering roles are emerging as the top hiring priority. U.S. tech managers are hiring for AI engineer positions. This surge in AI-focused recruitment is complemented by a growing need for full-stack engineers, who play a crucial role in building AI systems. The most sought-after jobs include AI engineers, cloud architects, and cybersecurity analysts. AI engineers, leveraging Python and TensorFlow, earn $150,000–$300,000 plus bonuses and stock, per Glassdoor. Cloud architects average $148,821, and cybersecurity analysts, vital amid digital threats, earn $120,000–$200,000, according to Robert Half. Work-from-home policies are shrinking. Robert Half finds only 18% of 2025 tech roles are fully remote, clashing with 46% of workers unwilling to return onsite full-time. Hybrid models dominate, with companies offering commute perks to lure workers back, per Crunchbase. This shift frustrates many, as flexibility remains a top priority, per Harvey Nash’s 2024 report. Life as a tech worker is dynamic but demanding. Many juggle upskilling in AI or cloud computing, with 87% of hiring leaders valuing AI experience, per ResumeTemplates.com. Long hours, especially in startups, contrast with perks like mental wellness support at firms like CoreWeave. However, the BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, driven by AI and fintech growth. Financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022, reflecting shifting priorities toward fintech innovation. The tech industry, heavily reliant on global supply chains, faces significant challenges from the 2025 tariffs. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA, which depend on manufacturing in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, are grappling with increased costs for imported hardware, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The Consumer Technology Association projects that tariffs could reduce U.S. consumer purchasing power by $90–143 billion, with potential declines in laptop and tablet purchases by up to 68% and smartphones by 37%. This drop in demand threatens revenue for hardware giants and e-commerce platforms, as seen in stock price drops. Business woman working in an incredible futuristic and original office space, looking at her phone, ... More worried about layoffs The tech industry faced significant workforce reductions, with Layoffs.fyi reporting that 50,728 employees were let go across 111 tech companies. This wave of layoffs, while less intense than the peak of 2023, reflects ongoing adjustments within the sector as companies navigate economic shifts, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. Among the companies leading these layoffs, Intel stands out with its announcement to cut approximately 22,000 jobs, representing 20% of its workforce. This move, the largest tech layoff of the year, underscores the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry. Meta followed with a reduction of 3,600 workers, roughly 5% of its staff, framing the cuts as a push to enhance productivity and eliminate underperforming roles. STMicro, another player in the electronics and semiconductor space, laid off 3,000 employees, grappling with market headwinds. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) trimmed 2,500 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, after a 19% drop in its stock price in the first quarter of 2025. Workday, a software firm, reduced its headcount by 1,750, or 8.5%, to redirect resources toward artificial intelligence initiatives. Microsoft also contributed to the trend, eliminating 2,280 roles across divisions like cloud services and mixed reality as part of performance-driven restructuring. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has reshaped priorities. Firms are channeling significant investments into AI development, automating tasks previously handled by human workers. This shift has rendered roles in areas like software engineering, human resources, and support teams redundant, as evidenced by cuts at Stack Overflow and Salesforce. Despite robust profits at some tech giants, high interest rates, inflation, and investor demands for leaner operations have pushed companies to prioritize cost-cutting. Meta and Microsoft, for instance, have used layoffs to bolster stock prices and strengthen their financial positions. Many firms are restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as AI and cybersecurity, as seen in Cisco’s strategic pivot away from less profitable segments. A concerning dynamic is at play. Once one or two top tier tech companies announce layoffs, it follows up with a copycat effect where companies also start laying off people too.

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V), Coca-Cola (KO), Booking Holdings (BKNG), and Novartis (NVS). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook — particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel. Later this week, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report after the bell Wednesday, giving investors a read on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital ad trends. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are on deck Thursday, while Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) is set to follow on Friday, capping one of the biggest earnings weeks of the year.

Title: The reality of today's tech industry: layoffs, long hours, AI threats, and few perks

Time Published: 2025-04-28T10:19:00Z

In a nutshell: It had long been said that a career in tech was the ultimate dream: high salaries, security, and a huge number of perks made for some very happy workers. But things look quite different today. The tech world has seen the highest number of layoffs of any private sector industry this year; perks have been cut; salaries aren't increasing in line with the extra demands; and there's the constant spectre of AI. As parodied in the brilliant TV show 'Silicon Valley', there was a time when some tech employees were paid fortunes to do almost nothing in their jobs. Their enviable situation was still being reported a couple of years ago, when companies were flush with cash and had hired extra workers during the pandemic boom. Now, we're faced with almost weekly headlines about tech's massive job cuts. Intel recently confirmed it is making layoffs that could impact 20,000+ people. Meta has cut 5% of its workforce in performance-based layoffs, something that Microsoft is also doing. Then there's Google, which this year has offered voluntary exit plans for some staff. Overall, more than 50,000 people from 100 tech companies have been laid off in 2025 so far. Google cut back on employee fitness classes in 2023 Beyond the layoffs, more tech-industry perks are disappearing. Working from home is becoming a taboo subject as more firms drag employees back into the office: Intel is increasing its three-day in-office mandate to four days, while Google has told many remote workers to return to physical locations or face termination. The Wall Street Journal notes that good pay is still prevalent among Silicon Valley companies, though AI experts are seeing their wages rise faster than anyone else. But firms have become obsessed with delivering the results that Wall Street analysts expect, and a lot of the revenue they bring in now goes toward AI infrastructure rather than universal wage boosts. Employees are also expected to work longer to stay competitive – Google co-founder Sergey Brin thinks 60 hours per week is the perfect amount for peak productivity. Sergey Brin Another problem is that many firms aren't filling the empty roles despite taking on more customers, with mundane day-to-day functions handed over to AI. The WSJ reports on an Amazon Web Services manager who says that he had to return to writing code for the first time in a decade last year as the team that would normally do it wasn't available. The publication reports on a Meta recruiter who was laid off by the social media giant and rehired as a "short-term employee." It means she doesn't get any pay increases, promotions, or stock, and she's responsible for a workload that used to be spread out among several people. Productivity, streamlining, efficiency, and cost cutting are becoming the mantras for tech companies, which some say is being spurred by President Trump and Elon Musk's budget slashing and purging of government agencies. The industry's amazing perks like almost-unlimited amount of leave, free merchandise and, in the case of Meta, free laundry and dry cleaning have gone. Even high-quality food and drink in the cafes is disappearing as companies look to save money at every turn. Will things improve? As the economy starts to look shakier amid the Trump tariffs and the AI obsession shows no signs of slowing down, it's unlikely that the tech world will return to the shining light it once was anytime soon.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change The Week That Was: 2025 04-26 (April 26, 2025)Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org)The Science and Environmental Policy Project Quote of the Week: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.” — James Madison (1788) Number of the Week: Increase of 11ºF by 2100. THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a discussion of the National Science Foundation. TWTW continues with a brief discussion of the scientific method and why the US National Climate Assessment does not meet the standards needed for its work to be considered physical science. TWTW considers the high scientific integrity of Roger Pielke, Jr. before criticizing his view that fixing the National Climate Assessment will be easy. TWTW then questions the actual physical science supporting EPA’s Endangerment Finding. It concludes with presenting three interesting articles on diverse subjects. ********************* NSF: The Nation Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in the US. Its counterpart in the medical fields is the National Institute of Health. The NSF’s enacted budget for fiscal year 2024 is $9.06 Billion. The requested 2025 budget is slightly over $10 billion. According to reports, the current request will be cut, and part of its workforce will be cut. On April 24, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced that he has resigned. News reports claimed this is proof of the anti-science bias of the current administration. The April 12 TWTW discussed a significant problem in US science funding. The U.S. Global Change Research Program publishes what is considered the nation’s premier report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment (NCA), produced by the consulting firm ICF International. The report is endorsed by 15 government agencies including the National Science Foundation. However, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023) is a blatantly political report that omits physical evidence that contradicts its general conclusions that the current warming is unprecedented. Further it contains no physical evidence showing the relationship between increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and increasing temperatures. Yet, it uses the discredited very high emissions scenario to forecast a temperature increase of 11ºF by 2100. The Fifth National Climate Assessment is not physical science but more a follow-up piece on the highly politicized Sixth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly its Synthesis Report (March 2023). The Synthesis Report contains none of the uncertainty expressed in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis (2021). The US National Climate Assessment should emphasize the uncertainty, not omit it. And the National Science Foundations should not be a party to such a poor report. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy, and Science, Policy, and Evidence. *************** Zero Omissions: Although its origins are far earlier, the scientific method became established during the controversy on an Earth-centered universe or a planetary system with the visible planets orbiting the sun. The great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) insisted that only careful observation over long periods of time can resolve the controversy. In 1572, Brahe observed a new bright star (probably a super nova) that triggered doubt in the old Aristotelian belief that the universe was fixed. Brahe developed a research program with improving the instruments used to observe the planets to determine the paths. After his death his assistant, Johannes Kepler used Brahe’s data to explain that the planetary orbits were not circular but formed an ellipse with the sun as one focus and to develop Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion. This history establishes an important principle in the scientific method; no observations should be omitted. As discussed above, in the reports of the IPCC, particularly the summaries, and in the National Climate Assessment (NCA), important observations are omitted. For example, for 99.9% of Earth’s history, there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature. For the last few glacial periods, CO2 changes have come after temperature changes. Two decades of data collected for measuring the earth’s energy balance reveal that the increase in absorbed heat is primarily due to changes in the earth’s albedo. Thus, these reports are not physical science. They do not use the scientific method. Some defenders of this practice in climate “science” avoid the issue by claiming that their work is based on “first principles” or fundamental concepts or assumptions, sometimes considered self-evident. Alas, first principles tell us about the patterns of spectra of molecules such as CO2 but cannot tell us precise energy levels. Nor can first principles tell us about the probability of absorbing IR of a certain wavelength. In Quantum Mechanics, first principles can tell us about the spacings of energy levels, but not their amounts. Precise measurements are required. Such issues are omitted in the NCA. Those who argue from the standpoint of first principles are in the realm of metaphysics, thinking about physics, not in the realm of physical physics. In his 1912 book Problems of Philosophy, the logician Betrand Russell has several chapters evaluating the work of Immanuel Kant questioning “Is a priori knowledge possible?” Can we know something by pure logic alone, without experience or observations? This is a philosophical question, not one for physical science based on observations. *************** Misguided Defense of NCA: Roger Pielke, Jr., is a scientist with considerable integrity. He wrote an essay published by the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology titled “Do Not Use the ICAT Hurricane Loss ‘Dataset’: An Opportunity for Course Correction in Climate Science.” Yet Pielke helped develop this dataset. The abstract states: “A fatally flawed time series of U.S. hurricane losses assembled by an insurance company almost a decade ago has found its way into analyses published in the peer-reviewed literature. The flawed time series is based on undocumented modifications to a research-quality dataset that I and my colleagues [sic.] published almost two decades ago. The uncritical use of the time series has led to erroneous conclusions published in the peer-reviewed literature which then were repeated in important climate science assessments. This paper explains the origin of the flawed dataset and demonstrates its many biases. The errors are so obvious and consequential that papers published in the peer-reviewed literature that rely on the flawed dataset should be retracted. While mistakes happen in science, what matters more is what we in the community do when mistakes are discovered.” Recognizing his considerable integrity, TWTW takes issue with Pielke’s defense of the National Climate Assessment. In a post “Trump Comes for Climate Research: Making sense of the USGCRP and NCA” Pielke writes: “To fix the NCA would not be difficult. Three actions are needed. First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. Second, the report should be led and written by experts chosen by an empaneling team. This team should be selected by a bipartisan group, as is typically done for reports on highly politicized issues. For instance, the majority and minority members of the House Science Committee could each select 6 members of this empaneling committee, with two co-chairs. The empaneling committee would then identify experts to lead and contribute to the report. Third, before the writing starts, the assessment team should query decision makers — federal, state, local, in business and civil society — to identify what information they perceive to be most useful to their decisions related to climate mitigation and adaptation. These three steps would ensure that there is no perception of White House influence on the report, that it is authored by experts assembled in a bipartisan manner and that the topics that the report focuses have direct relevance to decision makers. The NCA is far too important to be politicized, and politicization is a choice. The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and OMG [sic. OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. I do not expect the Trump Administration to take this (very good) advice.” To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. Omission of physical evidence has been a problem for years with the IPCC and the NCA, and with each iteration the problem has been getting worse. The IPCC reports on which the NCA is based have been politicized since “Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment” which Frederick Seitz asserted was the worst abuse of the peer review process he had witnessed in sixty years of American science. The National Climate Assessment is no better. The problem of omission of physical evidence is deeply ingrained, and a generation of scientists have been conditioned to accept it. The reports have become more metaphysics (thinking of physics) and propaganda than physical science. The issue is not trust in “the science” or politicalized scientists, the issue is adherence to the scientific method, a process. If physical evidence is omitted, the work is no longer physical science. Further, Pielke suggests cutting out the White House. The president is elected by the whole people, is accountable to them, and represents their interests. None of the other members of the panel he proposes are elected or accountable to all the people. There is no doubt that the influence of the White House in the past has not conformed to the principles of physical science, but then neither by and large has the pool of “experts” from which the other panel members would presumably be drawn. The only solution is to hold everyone to the principles of science and that can be done only by transparency and freedom of public comment. See links under Seeking a Common Ground. *************** Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding? The National Climate Assessment is claimed to support the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. The EPA’s press release on February 27 states [Boldface in original]: “Action On December 7, 2009, the Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities. However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors.” An article in the British medical publication, the Lancet, states: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations”. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? (Note that the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapor, is not mentioned.) The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science. Small corrections are not sufficient. It is wrong. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. *************** Radiation Transfer: In developing a method for estimating the greenhouse effect in today’s atmosphere, William Van Wijngaarden and William Happer use the work of physicist Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916). TWTW came across a 1906 essay by Schwarzschild. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Problems In World Economic Forum? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with: “World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab is under investigation by the organization he created after a new whistleblower letter alleged financial and ethical misconduct by the longtime leader and his wife. The anonymous letter was sent last week to the Forum’s board and raised concerns about the Forum’s governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the Forum’s resources without proper oversight, according to the letter and people familiar with the matter. It included allegations that Klaus Schwab asked junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used Forum funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels. It also alleged that his wife Hilde, a former Forum employee, scheduled “token” Forum-funded meetings in order to justify luxury holiday travel at the organization’s expense. Klaus Schwab in recent days argued against an investigation, telling board members that he denied the unsubstantiated allegations and that he would challenge them in a lawsuit, the people said. The board of trustees decided to open a probe during an emergency meeting on Easter Sunday. Schwab opted to resign immediately as the chairman, instead of staying on for an extended transition period as previously planned.” See Article # 1. *************** Wind Power, Maybe? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with (correction by TWTW): “Germany has invested so many hundreds of billions of euros in its green energy transition over the years that no one can tally the precise amount. Yet the share of wind and solar power in the country’s energy mix in the first quarter of this year managed to fall—by a lot. There’s a lesson for the U.S. here. Renewable sources made up some 47% of electricity consumption in Europe’s largest economy in the first three months of 2024 2025 the energy trade association BDEW reported Thursday. That’s down from 56% in the first three months of 2024. The drop comes despite Germany’s continuing build-out of renewable generation. The country has added 872 wind turbines with a capacity of 4.3 gigawatts since April 2024, yet wind-power output fell 16%. Ouch. You can guess what went wrong. February and March were unusually wind-free, onshore and offshore. A lack of rain meant hydropower underperformed. March was sunnier than usual, which helped to boost solar-electricity output compared to a year earlier. But we’re talking about Germany in March. Relatively short daylight hours in a northern latitude meant this boost wasn’t enough to offset the decline in wind generation. These climactic conditions happen regularly enough that the German language has a word for it: Dunkelflaute, or ‘dark stillness.’ It means renewables alone can’t power an advanced industrial economy, as even Berlin is starting to notice.” Germany is further down the road of free energy from wind and solar than the US. Yet, many US politicians cling to the belief that wind and solar can power a modern economy, especially high-tech that requires reliable electricity. See Article # 2. *************** SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Defensive Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. *************** Increase of 11ºF by 2100. As stated above, the Fifth US National Climate Assessment asserts that under the high emissions scenario, by 2100 temperatures will be 11ºF (6ºC) warmer than today.

The 2°C (3.6℉) limit is a best estimate of the maximum temperature rise beyond which the effects of global warming are unpredictable. It is a judgement call. The IPCC’s 1.5°C (2.7℉) goal was exceeded for the first time in 2024.

Hurricanes and Tornadoes and Wildfires By Joseph D’Aleo, ICECAP, Apr 22, 2025 http://icecap.us/index.php/go/joes-blog/updates/ Most major hurricanes evah! By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 The second key point is that tropical cyclone landfalls exhibit high variability. And as everybody knows who cares to, the greater the variability, the harder it is to separate noise from signal and the longer the time series you need to develop even medium confidence about a trend. Finally, the notion that major storms are surging proving a crisis and so forth is undermined by the fact that the trend for “Accumulated Cyclonic Energy” or total destructive horribleness of all storms in a year combined seems to be “flat as a pancake”. Here we go again, windstorm edition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 16, 2025 Supposedly it’s spring, despite various local headlines of the “Arctic air will spill into Ontario with possible 15-25 cm of April snow” variety.

For instance Matthew Wielicki notes that “It’s Tornado Season Again, Again, Again… So can the dreaded CO2 add causing American tornadoes to become less destructive to its list of blessings? Well, no.

Not surprisingly, even though there is a wild price spike, farmers in Ghana are leaving the industry, smuggling crops out (because they get a better price). They didn’t plant new trees, they ran out of money for fertilizer, and didn’t try new varieties. Their children don’t want to farm cocoa, and the yields are falling on old sickly plantations.

When the Wind Didn’t Blow in Germany A years-long renewables push leaves the economy hostage to the weather. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, April 25, 2025 Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe A. van Wijngaarden and W. Happer – Using simple thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that the atmosphere of a planet with suﬃciently high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Well, gee. An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection. Maybe the authors live in an alternate universe. Clueless – they are probably delusional enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to the atmosphere makes it hotter. Have people stopped thinking for themselves? Or does this sort of nonsense only occur in the USA? Nobody who contributes to WUWT, not even Michael Flynn, could possibly check the veracity of all the issues raised by this enormously convoluted and over-referenced post. What the hell is it about? I don’t understand the purpose of hosting it. Yours sincerely, Dr Bill Johnston, http://www.bomwatch.com.au ‘An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection.’ Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Please provide a citation from a competent source that explains how such an atmosphere will convect given that it can’t dump heat to space. It would convect in the instance of a surface temperature that varied from one place to another due to day/night, for one thing, latitude, surface slope for more, and so forth. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. The good news is that qualified academics like you and vW&H can differ re. these type of questions, meaning ‘The Science’ really isn’t settled to the point that we should be recklessly messing around with how we obtain energy. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. Don’t guess. Look at Richard Feynman’s lectures, where he says “It is not an isothermal atmosphere”, and how he comes to that conclusion. Observation supports the non-isothermal nature of the atmosphere. As to “what extent”, what has that to do with anything? Are you trying to resile from your previous blanket statements? None of this nonsense is going to back up any silly idea that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Lets’s stick to reality, if you don’t object too much. Both O2 and N2 emit and absorb infrared. Prof John Tyndall established this by experiment more than 150 years ago, and compared the absorption qualities of CO2 and H2O (for example) to dry air, purged of CO2. You can’t show me an experiment that demonstrates that your fantasy represents reality in any way. Next you’ll be telling me that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! ‘Lets’s stick to reality..’ Yes, let’s – show me a bona fide citation that O2 and N2 absorb and emit IR, i..e., show me their emission spectrums if you have any idea what those are. Otherwise, stop being an obnoxious troll who continuously spews nonsense to the delight of climate alarmists. Frank, you probably won’t accept Penn State as “bona fide”, but here’s something from Penn State – While all matter emits radiation at all wavelengths, it does not do so equally. This is where the next radiation law comes in. Wein’s Law states that the wavelength of peak emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting object. So I’ll wait for you to find some matter which does not emit or absorb infrared radiation. I won’t hold my breath waiting. It looks like you overlooked the words “troposphere” and “tropopause” in you criticism of van Wijngaarden and Happer. The Earth’s stratosphere does not have any significant convection, thus falsifying your assertion that “An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection”. Significant atmospheric convection is precluded when an atmosphere develops warmer layers above cooler layers, which can even occur temporarily in Earth’s troposphere under the weather phenomenon known as a “temperature inversion” Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . From the paper – must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Surface to tropopause. You wrote – Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . You are agreeing with me at this point? You have not managed to “falsify” anything I said. An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection. You may play all the silly semantic games you wish, but the presence of “greenhouse gases” is not necessary for convection to occur. Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware. You might read your attachment – “suppresses convection” presupposes convection in the first place. Do you not agree? Or maybe you are claiming that inversions cannot occur without the presence of “greenhouse gases? Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter! “You are agreeing with me at this point? “ No, isn’t that obvious? “An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection.” (repeated claim, to be sure!) No, but I’ll make the falsification of that statement even more obvious . . . see attachment. “Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware.” Humidity plays a significant role in the formation and characteristics of temperature inversions. While inversions are primarily defined by temperature differences between layers, humidity levels can influence the strength and persistence of inversions, particularly near the surface. (Hint for you: humidity is a measure of the average amount of water vapor content in a given parcel of air, and water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) “Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter!” Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. As I sad, greenhouse gases have nothing to do with inversions. CO2 is denser than air, H2O is less dense. You burble that – water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) Strongest? Strength compared to what, precisely? You are on the right track when you say – Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. Indeed. Adding so-called greenhouse gases has no quantifiable effect on temperature. By the way, your AI quote happens to mention that the Moon’s atmosphere lacks the characteristics of a “conventional dense atmosphere” – no mention of lighter H2O, or heavier CO2. Strange, that. Taking all that into account, tell what you think this mythical “greenhouse effect” is supposed to do? “It all depends”? Not much use at all, in that case. “Why Has the Daily Sceptic Been Put on Tortoise Media’s Climate Naughty List?” You do realise what Tortoise media is?

They’re the common-sense party, exactly what we want.” … “I wrote to Ed Miliband and told him about the fuel allowance.” “I got a letter off him, and he said that pensioners have never been as well off. I ripped the letter up, and said I would never vote Labour again.” … “I feel very disappointed in the Labour government,” [she says]. “I thought I’d give Labour a chance again, only to be bitterly disappointed.” “I think that for pensioners and the disabled, [Labour] are really doing a disservice to working class people who have contributed a lot to this country over the years. My trust in them has gone.” Would she contemplate voting Reform as a result? “I think Nigel Farage has some good points: what you see is what you get,” she says, admitting that “Reform or the Conservatives are a better bet for me than Labour at the moment.” https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/27/the-labour-stronghold-that-could-fall-to-reform/ One headline caught my eye…. “Labour Peer Predicts Party Will ‘Get its Head Kicked In’ by Farage over Failure to Address Working Class Concerns”https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/04/27/labour-peer-predicts-party-will-get-its-head-kicked-in-by-farages-reform/ His choice of language makes his feelings on the matter quite clear. It’s thuggish street fighting talk. Football fans even put it into song for the opposition. “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Head Kicked In”, sometimes pluralised to “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Heads Kicked In”, is a football chant originating in England. It is also used, apparently, as a case study in psychology and sociology. He could have said we will get trounced, lose badly etc etc etc. The inference is obvious, low class thugs vote Reform. To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. “To me” that’s a bit unfair to Roger. The copy of the “Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity” … which came with the recommendation that “federal agencies should adopt this definition, incorporate it into their scientific integrity policy, and communicate it to their workforce” … that I came across was for the HHS “federal agency” (direct link) : HHS adopts the following Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity: Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. I think that “the omission of physical evidence” is therefore covered when Roger wrote : The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and [OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. . Any “Real Scientist” (TM) who sees the words “honesty” and “scientific integrity” will also be reminded of Richard Feynman’s public lecture about “cargo-cult science”, which includes : There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science, it’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; Unfortunately, GHE believers are not scientists, as Richard Feynman describes science. Fanatical cultists would seem to be a more appropriate description. They have some bizarre notion that thermometers becoming hotter is not due to increased man-made heat, but rather the outputs of the combustion of hydrocarbons, namely CO2 and H2O. No amount of either, added to air, will make it hotter. Unbelievable gullibility, except that it is widely believed by people who are well educated and highly qualified. It just goes to show that intelligence is no protection against self deception. Roger Pielke did get this one wrong: First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House. ‘ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.’ You need to add provisos to the effect that this statement only holds if the Executive Branch is headed by a Democrat, and that if this condition is not met, oversight and control of these agencies will pass to the Democrat National Committee and/or such assignees as they may name. You need to add provisos . . . Why is that? “ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.” Not true according to Google’s AI bot which outputs the following: “There are federal agencies that operate independently from the Executive Branch, primarily those classified as independent regulatory agencies and some independent agencies within the executive branch. These agencies are not subject to direct presidential control, although they do maintain some form of relationship with the executive branch. “Here’s a more detailed explanation: Independent Regulatory Agencies: These agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are established by Congress and have the power to make regulations and enforce laws, often without direct presidential oversight. Independent Agencies within the Executive Branch: Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which operate with a degree of independence from the direct control of the President.” {my bold emphasis added} From the Fifth Climate Assessment Report: Somehow, I remain “skeptical,” if by skeptical, I mean gagging on propaganda. The findings in this report are based on a comprehensive review and assessment of information sources determined to meet the standards and documentation required under the Information Quality Act and the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (App. 2), including peer-reviewed literature, other literature, Indigenous Knowledge, other expert and local knowledge, and climate data processed and prepared for authors by NOAA’s Technical Support Unit (TSU; see Guide to the Report section below and App. 3). NCA5 was thoroughly reviewed by Federal Government experts, external experts, and the public multiple times throughout the report development process. An expert external review was performed by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.3 Additional information on the development of this Assessment can be found in Appendix 1: Assessment Development Process. The great genius of the founding fathers was that they didn’t set up one government, they created the federal government as essentially three governments. Each with its own powers. The three branches were set up in opposition to the others, such that no branch could do anything on its own. They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government. To our regret, later generations decided that efficiency was more important, so they tore down many of the walls the founders had set up. As a result, we now have the Beast of Columbia, that rules over all of us with an iron fist. ‘They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government.’ Not true. The original idea was that the people of the sovereign states agreed per ratification of the Constitution to set up a limited federal government. Unfortunately the latter has been highly successful in re-defining ‘limited’ over time, although I think some people are starting to wake up. Under the above article’s subheading of Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding?, the British medical publication the Lancet is quoted as stating: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases ‘threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations’. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” “Science-rooted Endangerment Finding” . . . who are they (both the EPA and the Lancet) kidding? Also, underneath this quote are these statements from the article’s TWTW author(s): “Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? . . .The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science.” Some hard facts to go along with that: Given the current (2025) concentration of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is only at around 425 ppm, the Lancet, with its asserted focus on human health, should have noted the following regarding ACCEPTABLE levels of CO2 in air that humans breath over very long time periods: — in general indoor environments (homes/bedrooms, offices, theaters, auditoriums . . . all without overcrowding), the typical CO2 level can be up to 800 ppm CO2 — in school classrooms, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) recommends that CO2 levels not exceed 1000 ppm — The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that industry workers have an allowable 8-hour time-weighted-average of breathing air not to exceed 5,000 ppm CO2 concentration, and going further stating a “short term” exposure limit in breathing air at 30,000 ppm CO2 is acceptable (note: these are specialized work environments, such as work in confined spaces or near CO2-emitting equipment where such high concentrations may be present) — US Navy submarines routinely operate with allowable concentrations in the their breathable air having up to 11,000 ppm CO2; their maximum, non-emergency upper limit for CO2 concentration is 30,000 ppm (3%); the Navy conducted numerous studies in the 1960’s–1970’s and found that two weeks of continuous breathing of air with CO2 concentrations at 40,000 ppm did not affect performance on multiple tests of cognitive function in physically fit young men — Aboard the International Space Station, the minimum CO2 concentration in the ambient, breathable air is approximately 3,000 ppm, but can reach values greater than 6,500 ppm. The mean concentration is not reduced below 3,000 ppm due to the stations’s limited supply of electrical energy and the capacity of its “air scrubbing” equipment to do such. In addition to the above, when just sitting around humans exhale air having a CO2 concentration in the range of 4–5%, that’s 40,000–50,000 ppm! Yet the EPA Endangement Finding declares CO2 at a value of 850 ppm (the measured atmospheric level back in 2009) threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations??? Obviously, there was no science whatsoever supporting the EPA’s “Finding”. A “bipartisan” commission to repair the NCA, per Roger Pielkie Jr., will probably fix nothing. I point to the example of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (or Simpson–Bowles). Did that do any good?

Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.
