Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù relationship with their work, compared to those who don‚Äôt use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who‚Äôs hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). ‚ÄúKnowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don‚Äôt,‚Äù HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,‚Äù said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. ‚ÄúThere are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,‚Äù he told Quartz.

But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don‚Äôt want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that‚Äôs important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,‚Äù Altman said on the ‚ÄúHow I Write‚Äù podcast hosted by David Perell.

Title: Why Amazon‚Äôs Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/

Amazon's return-to-work mandate is the canary in the workplace coal mine. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week called all of the company‚Äôs employees back to the office five days a week, part of an effort to preserve the company‚Äôs culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand ‚Äî hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest. Amazon‚Äôs decision isn‚Äôt just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It‚Äôs actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that‚Äôs seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance. And leaders know this full well. PWC‚Äôs Invesco Dynamic Market ETF 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don‚Äôt feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty. This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù‚Äìa clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways‚Äìtogether. But this vision has stalled‚Äìwith whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon‚Äôs actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we‚Äôre all going to lose if the battle continues. To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices. This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization‚Äîreplacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity. As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment‚Äìto the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, ‚Äúwhat do we owe each other?‚Äù What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies‚Äìtaking productivity and profits to the grave. In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù a face-to-face culture, where ‚Äúcollaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.‚Äù What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be? Culture has come to loosely mean ‚Äúhow I like to work.‚Äù For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy‚Äôs frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon‚Äôs culture as ‚Äútoxic,‚Äù a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it‚Äôs the how, not the where. It‚Äôs about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it‚Äôs tough, it‚Äôs not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it‚Äôs at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it‚Äôs just another pawn in the workplace power struggle. The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It‚Äôs time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Angry Amazon employees are ‚Äòrage applying‚Äô for new jobs after Andy Jassy‚Äôs RTO mandate: ‚ÄòI will not go back‚Äô

Laura was working from home when her husband forwarded her a link to the news: Amazon tells employees to return to office five days a week. It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute. ‚ÄúAt first, I didn‚Äôt quite believe it,‚Äù she tells Fortune. ‚ÄúAfter all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that‚Äôs going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn‚Äôt happen for a couple of days.‚Äù Laura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon‚Äôs offices. That was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to ‚Äúgo back to being in the office together the majority of the time‚Äù‚Äîat least, three days per week. ‚ÄúThe original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,‚Äù she says. After the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clarity washed over: ‚ÄúMy months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.‚Äù Even if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon‚Äôs remote work bait and switch. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.‚Äù Laura‚Äôs not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they‚Äôre so frustrated with the tech giant‚Äôs war on working from home that they‚Äôre officially on the job hunt. Two say they learned the news‚Äîand its implications‚Äîvia the media, rather than a manager. One says they‚Äôve already handed their notice in. Another says they‚Äôve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement. Amazon did not respond to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot going to work out‚Äù for them at the company. Despite this, it‚Äôs clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now. Experts previously told Fortune that Amazon‚Äôs 5-day mandate is a ‚Äúnegotiation game‚Äù to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for. ‚ÄúI was not complying,‚Äù Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy. He briefly considered moving before thinking again: ‚ÄúI decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.‚Äù Some managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect. One employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023‚Äîa month after the company announced its initial RTO policy. ‚ÄúI left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,‚Äù Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.‚Äù He says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work. ‚ÄúHe told me he would not be able to help, they‚Äôve made him go into an office too,‚Äù Luca says, adding that he couldn‚Äôt get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room. ‚ÄúI like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.‚Äù Whether Jassy‚Äôs latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he‚Äôs given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff‚Äîor quit. Most of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway. While Jassy positioned Amazon‚Äôs changes‚Äîwhich also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking‚Äîas a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it‚Äôs a thinly veiled headcount reduction. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,‚Äù Gen X program manager Jared says. Although he‚Äôs only been working at Amazon for six months, he‚Äôs already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2. ‚ÄúThe new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,‚Äù Jared scoffs. ‚ÄúI will not go back.‚Äù While he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon‚Äôs competitors are still offering some working from home‚Äîand he thinks many others will do the same. ‚ÄúAs a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,‚Äù Jared adds. ‚ÄúOne of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.‚Äù He‚Äôs not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit‚Äîhe took ‚Äúvoluntary termination‚Äù two months ago and has now started his own firm. Likewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy‚Äôs announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters. ‚ÄúThis new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,‚Äù she says, adding that she has been a ‚Äútop-rated employee year on year‚Äù thanks to working from home. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,‚Äù Lisa adds. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.‚Äù Every job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she‚Äôs confident she‚Äôll find a more flexible employer before the New Year. Within 48 hours of Amazon‚Äôs new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews. ‚ÄúI will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.‚Äù Interviewee names have been changed for anonymity. ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

For example, in May 2024, a U.S. labor agency accused by Tesla of discouraging workers from creating a union at its Buffalo, NY plant.However, on average 67% of those polled in the Blind survey said they were likely to join a union and 73% said that unions ‚Äúmostly helped.‚ÄùWhen Blind asked tech workers why the industry‚Äôs union membership rate is so low compared to other jobs, the general sentiment indicated that tech employees are already well compensated for their jobs, without needing collective bargaining.The tech sector might be poised for an upswing after Federal Reserve‚Äôs first big rate cut.

Title: Hollywood's big boom has gone bust
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6er83ene6o
Time Published: 2024-09-28T23:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood‚Äôs golden age of streaming. The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he‚Äôs on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. ‚ÄúWe were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTwo years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." ‚ÄúNow I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.‚Äù For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood‚Äôs writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they‚Äôre not eligible or they‚Äôve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means fewer new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn‚Äôt sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don‚Äôt pay for cable TV funded by commercials. ‚ÄúThe air has come out of the content bubble,‚Äù says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. ‚ÄúCrisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.‚Äù Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. ‚ÄúIt caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,‚Äù Mr Belloni says. ‚ÄúNetflix crashed ‚Äì all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered ‚Äì but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.‚Äù And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. ‚ÄúThe entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,‚Äù Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a ‚Äúcornerstone‚Äù of the city‚Äôs economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (¬£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. ‚ÄúWhat makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,‚Äù he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood ‚Äúalways thinks it‚Äôs in crisis,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.‚Äù Mr Fortin‚Äôs drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he‚Äôs flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. ‚ÄúIt was a great wave, and it crashed,‚Äù Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. ‚ÄúThings are coming in little by little,‚Äù he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. ‚ÄúHollywood gave me everything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.‚Äù The restrained debate was a stark contrast to the fiery showdown between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, writes Anthony Zurcher. Israel warns of consequences for the attack, which Iran says was retaliation for attacks on its allies. Catastrophic flooding decimated towns, destroyed roads and cut off power in the US's south-east. BBC Verify looks into Donald Trump's claim that Kamala Harris ‚Äúallowed‚Äù 13,000 non-citizens convicted of homicide to enter the US. US President Joe Biden says the US "actively" supported Israel's defence at his direction. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: Dell says sales team must work on-site 5 days a week to drive productivity
URL: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/dell-says-sales-team-must-work-on-site-5-days-a-week-to-drive-productivity/

Most members of Dell‚Äôs sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, Reuters reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping ‚Äúgrow skills,‚Äù per the note. Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have posted online (The Register reported that the post ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren‚Äôt required to go into an office but ‚Äúshould prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.‚Äù The policy doesn‚Äôt apply to ‚Äúremote sales team members,‚Äù but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers ‚Äúin the coming weeks.‚Äù Bloomberg reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell‚Äôs president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying: ‚Ä¶ our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite. Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team‚Äôs culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like ‚Äúreal-time feedback‚Äù and ‚Äúdynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said. Notably, the letter, which was reportedly sent to workers on Thursday, doesn‚Äôt give employees much time for adjustments. The memo acknowledges that workers have built schedules around working from home regularly but doesn‚Äôt offer immediate solutions. In a statement to The Register, a Dell spokesperson confirmed the policy change. ‚ÄúWe continually evolve our business so we‚Äôre set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," they said. "That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership." After permitting full-time remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February, Dell started requiring workers to go into the office 39 days per quarter (or about three days per week) or be totally remote. The latter, however, seemed discouraged, as Dell reportedly told remote workers they were ineligible for promotions in March. Still, nearly 50 percent of Dell workers chose to stay remote, Business Insider reported in June, citing internal Dell Data. Dell‚Äôs return-to-office (RTO) mandates have reportedly been enforced with VPN and badge tracking. Some employees have accused Dell of trying to reduce headcount with RTO policies. Other companies pushing workers back into offices have also been accused of this; there‚Äôs research showing that at least some companies have used RTO policies to lower headcount while avoiding layoffs. Dell laid off 13,000 people in 2023 and plans more layoffs. In August, it announced plans to lay off an undisclosed additional number of people. The company is expected to have 120,000 employees. Dell‚Äôs RTO change follows an announcement this week requiring Amazon employees to work on-site five days a week starting next year. Following the announcement, a survey of 2,585 US Amazon employees found that 73 percent of Amazon workers are ‚Äúconsidering looking for an another job‚Äù in response. The memo, according to Reddit, acknowledges to workers, ‚ÄúYes, this is a shift from current expectations.‚Äù Dell‚Äôs RTO push represents an about-face from previously stated positions on remote work from the company. In 2022, for example, CEO and founder Michael Dell wrote a blog that said Dell ‚Äúfound no meaningful differences‚Äù between remote and on-site workers, including before the pandemic. Dell COO Jeff Clarke made similar arguments in 2020. The idea that remote work hinders productivity has been a hot topic of debate, especially as companies grapple with their remote work policies following pandemic restrictions. Dell says that its decision to force sales workers back into offices is backed by data, and its claims of boosted productivity could potentially be true when it comes to this specific Dell division. However, there have also been studies suggesting that return-to-office mandates hurt productivity. For example, a Great Place to Work survey conducted in July 2023 of 4,400 employees concluded that ‚Äúproductivity was lower for both on-site and remote employees when their employer mandated where they work.‚Äù Workers with companies allowing employees to choose between remote and on-site work were more likely to give ‚Äúextra effort," the survey found.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin‚Äô As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse

(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra ‚ÄúStay Alive Until 2025‚Äù is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney‚Äôs Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit‚Äôs films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn‚Äôt enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of at least $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven‚Äôt spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney‚Äôs ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent exits by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN‚Äôs President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a recent memo will make the company ‚Äúmore strategic, collaborative and nimble‚Äù while resulting in ‚Äúnew positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.‚Äù Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men‚Äôs basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure‚Äôs University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry‚Äôs many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely won‚Äôt close until well into 2025. Nonetheless, Paramount‚Äôs three-headed Office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney‚Äôs. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company‚Äôs main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service‚Äôs eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating on a stand-alone basis after the merger finally closes. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially given the many overlapping operations with Skydance in film, TV and animation production. But it‚Äôs all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T‚Äôs spotty previous stewardship). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal‚Äôs new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, a burgeoning wireless carrier, and theme parks. It‚Äôs useful to view the imminent (and entirely self-driven) retirement of beloved Today Show Hoda Kotb this week, with her $20-million-a-year contract, as just one example of what‚Äôll be happening with NBC News salaries for on-air personalities as contracts come up for negotiation. More big names are likely to move on, or eat a pay cut or minimal pay hike in the new era. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs ‚Äúmore effectively‚Äù to ‚Äúfuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.‚Äù Hollywood‚Äôs biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive ‚Äî even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn‚Äôt include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. The mediacos are feeling Wall Street pressure to turn streaming services into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the accelerating swoon in customers watching the companies‚Äô legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. Now it‚Äôs reportedly reconsidering the cost-plus approach to its talent deals, going back to a modified version of a flat fee with an actual back-end for successful projects (only). But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company‚Äôs most-watched shows of 2024‚Äôs first half, according to Netflix‚Äôs recent release of viewership statistics. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That‚Äôll likely be huge for Netflix viewership, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games‚Äô rights won‚Äôt be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that‚Äôs good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that‚Äôs also money that won‚Äôt be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios. Keeping a job in film and television seemingly has never been more difficult.

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, ‚ÄúWorking remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,‚Äù as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, ‚ÄúRemote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,‚Äù Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year.
