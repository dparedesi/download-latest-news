Microsoft is laying off employees across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, according to two people familiar with the matter. A Microsoft spokesperson said the layoffs were small but didn't specify a figure. They also said the layoffs were unrelated to the job cuts Business Insider recently reported, which were targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the people familiar with the matter said employees started receiving notifications on Tuesday about layoffs in Microsoft's security unit. The group is run by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon, who stunned the industry when he left for Microsoft in 2021 to lead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for every employee. The change followed years of security issues at Microsoft, including what the Department of Homeland Security called "a cascade of security failures" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. The company also made security a core priority on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews. "If you're faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to Microsoft employees last year.

Title: Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos Are All Headed to Trump’s Inauguration

It should come as no surprise at this point, but NBC News is reporting that Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos will all be attending President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th. What do all of these tech leaders have in common? They have all publicly come out with varying degrees of support for Trump’s incoming administration, and all three have donated money to his campaign or the inauguration. It represents a major pivot from Trump’s first time in office when the tech industry kept its distance from him and eventually booted him from their services altogether following the January 6 Capitol riots. Zuckerberg in particular has gone from having a quite acrimonious relationship with Trump, who threatened him with prison over his stance on moderating conservative content, but now feels better about him as Zuckerberg has promised to loosen content restrictions on Meta’s platforms, gotten rid of the company’s DEI programs, and put in place an outspoken Republican to lead its policy arm. Bezos, as the owner of the Washington Post, regularly received barbs from Trump his first go around and saw the possibility of USPS prices charged to Amazon being raised in retaliation for his newspaper’s coverage. Meta and Amazon have both donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and Elon Musk of course aggressively spent money campaigning for Trump’s re-election. He will be helping to cut government spending through DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, and has been looking to hire more figures from tech to staff the initiative. According to NBC, the three tech leaders will be seated “on the platform near cabinet officials and elected leaders.” What is perhaps most notable about Silicon Valley’s pivot towards Trump is just how out in the open it all is. Whereas in the past an investigative journalist might have needed to do some digging to discover pay-for-play schemes, none of the tech leaders here are hiding what they are doing. They are pulling out all the stops to get on Trump’s good side, prevent any attacks he might bring, and perhaps get preferential treatment for lucrative defense contracts. This despite the fact that tech employees tend to be much more liberal than their employers. But these leaders must figure the pros of supporting Trump outweigh the cons. Especially now that the tech industry has gone through massive layoffs in recent years, rank-and-file engineers do not have the power they once had.

“The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World” by Natalia Peart, Ph.D. with Christopher Burge, is released with Forbes Books. NEW YORK (January 14, 2025) — The New Life Blueprint: A 21st Century Guide to Success, Health, Wealth, and Happiness in a Complex World by Dr. Natalia Peart with Christopher Burge is now available. Published with Forbes Books, the exclusive business book publishing imprint of Forbes, this groundbreaking guide is available today on Amazon. The world has changed more in the last few years than in the previous fifty. People of all ages and income levels now face pervasive economic worries, from the high cost of living to inflation and the threat of layoffs. These worries have left many feeling vulnerable in their careers, finances, and lives. We’re also dealing with many big shifts and disruptions happening one right after the other or all at once. The epidemics of stress and burnout, as well as the rising anxiety, loneliness, and other mental health struggles, speak to the constant mental and emotional challenges we face. “Traditionally, success was a straightforward formula: get a degree, land a job, work hard, and enjoy the rewards, " Dr. Peart said. “But now, this is a more complex world with constant change and disruption as the norm, so the strategies that once promised a clear path to the American Dream, like pursuing a conventional education or climbing the company ladder, no longer guarantee success or even continual progress toward our goals.” Many of us find ourselves unprepared and uncertain since the old life blueprint and instructions for living a good life no longer apply. Peart and Burge respond to this challenge by reinventing the old blueprint into a modern-era career, mental, financial, and lifestyle blueprint. Their new roadmap provides readers with the instructions and guidance they need to equip and prepare themselves to navigate their professional and personal lives, build resilience in constant uncertainty, and achieve the sustainable success, health, wealth, and happiness they seek. The New Life Blueprint is important because it captures the urgency and necessity for a redefined approach to living in a complex world, making the central idea timely and impactful. Readers will also close the book armed with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to navigate their lives amidst ongoing changes and uncertainties. This release is posted on behalf of Forbes Books (operated by Advantage Media Group under license).

Title: Seattle's new $20 minimum wage claims 6th restaurant casualty since New Year

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/14/2025 5:39:51 AM PST by george76 The number of restaurants in the Emerald City could drop by up to 8% this year.. Seattle’s new $20 minimum wage for 2025 has caused a 6th restaurant to close since the new year. Pike Place Market bakery The Confectional closed on Sunday after 18 years in business. ... Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Pike Place Market bakery The Confectional closed on Sunday after 18 years in business. ... Owner Destiny Sund told KIRO News Radio, “I wanted my team to have a wonderful holiday season, so I didn’t mention to them that we would be closing until after New Year’s Day. So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs.

So this has been a long week for all of us at The Confectional.” The minimum wage for all employees in the city limits, regardless of business size, jumped to $20.76 on January 1. Last year, if a worker earned at least $2.72 per hour in medical benefits or tips, the business only had to pay its employees $17.25 per hour, but now, for those businesses that featured tips, the change to the minimum wage was a 20 percent increase. The Emerald City's increase is $4 more than Washington State’s minimum wage requirement. Sund added, “That allowed businesses 50 employees or under to subtract $2.00 from the minimum wage. If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

If they could make it up in tips and or benefits. And my employees did make that up in tips.” She continued, “And just doing the math with the additional increase and the loss of the tip credit, it would cost my business an additional $18,000. And that’s just not sustainable.” ... Last week, the owner of the Bel Gatto bakery in West Seattle posted a sign on its door announcing that they were closing, saying, “Our revenues, unfortunately, are not able to cover the close to 20% increase in mandated wages, salaries and payroll taxes put into effect by the Seattle City Council effective 1/1/25. This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

This ruling has made continuation of our bakery operations untenable.” ... Jackson’s Catfish Corner, which has served Seattle’s Central District for 40 years, closed last week, with owner Terrell Jackson saying in an Instagram video announcing the closure, “I just cannot do it anymore. I’m maxxed out, y’all.” He specifically cited the minimum wage hike, declining foot traffic, and the overall rising cost of doing business in Seattle. “I know that the minimum wage went up to 20 bucks an hour… I know that’s hard for my business as a small black business. I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

I’m not Amazon or Walgreens or Walmart who can pay their employees that much.” The owners of The Jilted Siren in Capitol Hill said the council’s new minimum wage forced them out of business and they were hoping to re-open somewhere else. Plum Bistro, a family-owned business that has served the neighborhood for 20 years, shuttered and closed both Plum Bistro and Plum Chopped, their smaller lunch and salad satellite restaurant next door. On Jan 1, Bebop Waffle Shop, which has been open for over a decade, closed its doors for good, citing the new minimum wage law. Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

Owner Corina Luckenbach told Fox 13, “This is financially just not going to make sense anymore. Because, just for me, the increase would cost me $32,000 more a year.” President and CEO of the Washington Hospitality Association Anthony Anton told The Seattle Times that the situation “It’s just not sustainable,” and predicted that the number of restaurants in the Emerald City will drop by between 5 and 8 percent this year. The trend is following a similar pattern as California, which in April 2024 enacted California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's $20 minimum wage. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the state's restaurant industry while businesses have been forced to cut hours and increase prices to survive the costly wage increase that has resulted in mass layoffs. Shake Shack closed six of its California locations due to the minimum wage increase, while other franchises, including McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, and In-N-Out Burger, had to raise prices to cover costs. Many of the franchises were forced to reduce employee hours, and others transitioned to automation.

If you want the joint to stay in business, tip the owner - the employees are already well-compensated. NEVER vote for democRats to run anything. Copilot: how much per hour do fast food workers make in Seatle WA? $21.60 an hour As of January 6, 2025, the average hourly pay for a Fast Food Worker in Seattle, WA is $21.60 an hour. The average salary for a Food Service Worker is $20.97 per hour in Seattle, WA. $21.60 an hour As of January 6, 2025, the average hourly pay for a Fast Food Worker in Seattle, WA is $21.60 an hour.

So beyond the closure of eateries, Seattle may close I wonder if they still have the metro vending machines that spit out change in the form of Susan B Anthony $1 coins? Embrace the suck Seattle. Large places will automate but for a mom & pop, it may not be economically feasible. Hey Seattle, true min. wage is $0.00 per hour because that’s what the former employees are now making. Less small businesses means the middle class gets smaller, and the 1% who Democrats claim to hate gets bigger. All going according to plan. Politicians know more than businessmen how to run their businesses. Ain’t Communism wonderful. I'm sure the democrat voters who caused this will be happy to pay up...... Some never understand greed it reaches a point where you have no job and there is no utopia. Making everyone go broke is not a solution. They don’t care. They’ll burn it down to rule over the ashes. Newsom in California said the $20/hour minimum wage would allow fast food workers to enter the middle class - he raised them up, all right, right into unemployment! Result: Closed businesses, smaller portions and higher prices, more unemployment. Two McRib meals, medium sized, set me back $32. THAT is not sustainable for the average family around here. How many will continue to vote for the same politicians that got the into this mess? Seems like the small businesses in the middle of VA have figured things out. The cost of 2 entrees and soup at the local Chinese joint was $45.00 plus tip!!! Ouch!! The food was mediocre at best. Yes, large chains can pay more and absorb the cost. Small businesses run on smaller margins. You’re not an economist, eh? Proving once again that minimum wage laws produce wages of $0/hour long term. I’ve heard leftists lecture everyone that if these restaurants can’t remain viable despite the wage increases, then that’s just Darwinian selection.

Title: Technology Trends for 2025

What O'Reilly Learning Platform Usage Tells Us About Where the Industry Is Headed Welcome to our annual report on the usage of the OâReilly learning platform. Itâs been an exciting year, dominated by a constant stream of breakthroughs and announcements in AI, and complicated by industry-wide layoffs. Generative AI gets better and betterâbut that trend may be at an end. Now the ball is in the application developersâ court: Where, when, and how will AI be integrated into the applications we build and use every day? And if AI replaces the developers, who will be left to do the integration? Our data shows how our users are reacting to changes in the industry: Which skills do they need to brush up on? Which do they need to add? What do they need to know to do their day-to-day work? In short: Where have we been in the past year, and where are we going? We arenât concerned about AI taking away software developersâ jobs. Ever since the computer industry got started in the 1950s, software developers have built tools to help them write software. AI is just another tool, another link added to the end of that chain. Software developers are excited by tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other coding assistants that make them more productive. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Thatâs only one of the stories weâre following. Here are a few of the others: All of these trends have been impacted, if not driven, by AIâand that impact will continue in the coming year. Finally, some notes about methodology. Skip this paragraph if you want; we donât mind. This report is based on the use of OâReillyâs online learning platform from January 1, 2024, to September 30, 2024. Year-over-year comparisons are based on the same period in 2023. The data in each graph is based on OâReillyâs âunits viewedâ metric, which measures the actual use of each item on the platform. It accounts for different usage behavior for different media: text, courses, and quizzes. In each graph, the data is scaled so that the item with the greatest units viewed is 1. That means items within a graph are comparable to each other, but you canât compare an item in one graph to an item in another. And all percentages are reported with two significant digits. When we look at how our customers use the OâReilly learning platform, we always think in terms of skills. What skills are they trying to gain? And how are they trying to improve their knowledge? This year, one thread that we see across all of our platform is the importance of artificial intelligence. Itâs all about upskilling in the age of AI. It will surprise absolutely nobody that AI was the most active category in the past year. For the past two years, large models have dominated the news. That trend started with ChatGPT and its descendants, most recently GPT 4o1. But unlike 2022, when ChatGPT was the only show anyone cared about, we now have many contenders. Claude has emerged as a favorite among programmers. After a shaky start, Googleâs Gemini models have become solid performers. Llama has established itself as one of the top models and as the matriarch of a rich ecosystem of open1 models. Many of the open models can deliver acceptable performance when running on laptops and phones; some are even targeted at embedded devices. So what does our data show? First, interest in almost all of the top skills is up: From 2023 to 2024, Machine Learning grew 9.2%; Artificial Intelligence grew 190%; Natural Language Processing grew 39%; Generative AI grew 289%; AI Principles grew 386%; and Prompt Engineering grew 456%. Among the top topics, the most significant decline was for GPT itself, which dropped by 13%ânot a huge decline but certainly a significant one. Searches for GPT peaked in March 2023 and have been trending downward ever since, so our search data matches our usage data. Weâre used to seeing interest move from a more general high-level topic to specific skills as an industry sector matures, so this trend away from GPT in favor of more abstract, high-level topics is counterintuitive. But in context, itâs fairly clear what happened. For all practical purposes, GPT was the only game in town back in 2023. The situation is different now: Thereâs lots of competition. These other models donât yet show up significantly in search or usage data, but the users of our platform have figured out whatâs important: not learning about GPT or Claude or Gemini or Mistral but getting the background you need to make sense of any model. Discovering a workflow that fits your needs is important, and as Simon Willison points out, your ideal workflow may actually involve using several models. Recent models are all good, but they arenât all good in the same way. AI has had a great year, but will it continue to show gains in 2025? Or will it drop back, much as ChatGPT and GPT did? That depends on many factors. Gartner has generative AI slipping into the âtrough of disillusionmentââand whatever you think of the technologyâs promise, remember that the disillusionment is a sociological phenomenon, not a technical one, and that it happens because new technologies are overhyped. Regardless of generative AIâs long-term promise, we expect some disillusionment to set in, especially among those who havenât properly understood the technology or its capabilities. Prompt Engineering, which gained 456% from 2023 to 2024, stands out. A 456% gain isnât as surprising as it seems; after all, people only started talking about prompt engineering in 2023. Although âprompt engineeringâ was bandied about as a buzzword, it didnât become a skill that employers were looking for until late in 2023, if that. That may be an early warning signal for AI disillusionment. Searches for âprompt engineeringâ grew sharply in 2023 but appeared to decline slightly in 2024. Is that noise or signal? If disillusionment in Prompt Engineering sets in, weâll also see declines in higher-level topics like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Thereâs a different take on the future of prompt engineering. There have been a number of arguments that the need for prompt engineering is temporary. As generative AI improves, this line of reasoning contends, we will no longer need to write complex prompts that specify exactly what we want the AI to do and how to do it. Prompts will be less sensitive to exactly how theyâre worded; changing a word or two will no longer give a completely different result. Weâll no longer have to say âexplain it to me as if I were five years oldâ or provide several examples of how to solve a problem step-by-step. Some recent developments point in that direction. Several of the more advanced models have made the âexplain it to meâ prompts superfluous. OpenAIâs GPT 4o1 has been trained in a way that maximizes its problem-solving abilities, not just its ability to string together coherent words. At its best, it eliminates the need to write prompts that demonstrate how to solve the problem (a technique called few-shot prompting). At worst, it âdecidesâ on an inappropriate process, and itâs difficult to convince it to solve the problem a different way. Anthropicâs Claude has a new (beta) computer use feature that lets the model use browsers, shells, and other programs: It can click on links and buttons, select text, and do much more. (Google and OpenAI are reportedly working on similar features.) Enabling a model to use the computer in much the same way as a human appears to give it the ability to solve multistep problems on its own, with minimal description. Itâs a big step toward a future full of intelligent agents: linked AI systems that cooperate to solve complex problems. However, Anthropicâs documentation is full of warnings about serious security vulnerabilities that remain to be solved. Weâre thrilled that Anthropic has been forthright about these weaknesses. But still, while computer use may be a peek at the future, itâs not ready for prime time. AI will almost certainly slide into a trough of disillusionment; as Iâve said, the trough has more to do with sociology than with technology. But OpenAI and Anthropic are demonstrating important paths forward. Will these experiments bear fruit in the next year? Weâll see. Many skills associated with AI also showed solid gains. Use of content about Deep Learning is up 14%, Generative Models is up 26%, and GitHub Copilot is up 471%. Use of content about the major AI libraries was up slightly: PyTorch gained 6.9%, Keras increased 3.3%, and Scikit-Learn gained 1.7%. Usage of TensorFlow content declined 28%; its continued decline indicates that PyTorch has won the hearts and minds of AI developers. These gainsâparticularly Copilotâsâare impressive, but a more important story concerns two skills that came out of nowhere: Usage of content about LangChain is on a par with PyTorch, and RAG is on a par with Keras. Neither of these skills were in last yearâs report; in 2023, content usage for LangChain and RAG was minimal, largely because little content existed. Theyâve caught on because both LangChain and RAG are tools for building better applications on top of AI models. GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama arenât the end of the road. RAG lets you build applications that send private data to a model as part of the prompt, enabling the model to build answers from data that wasnât in its training set. This process has several important consequences: It minimizes the probability of error or âhallucinationâ; it makes it possible to attribute answers to the sources from which they came; and it often makes it possible to use a much smaller and more economical model. LangChain is the first of many frameworks for building AI agents. (OpenAI has Swarm; Google has an Agent Builder thatâs part of Vertex; Salesforce and other vendors also have offerings.) Agents are software that can plan and execute multistage actions, many of which are delegated to other AI models. Claudeâs computer use API is another facet of this trend, along with whatever products OpenAI and Google may be building. Saying that usage has increased 26 million percent isnât to the pointâbut realizing that LangChain has grown from near zero to a platform on a par with PyTorch is very much so. Agentic applications are certainly the next big trend within AI. Artificial intelligence relies heavily on what we used to call (and perhaps still call) data science. Building AI models requires data at unprecedented scale. Building applications with RAG requires a portfolio of data (company financials, customer data, data purchased from other sources) that can be used to build queries, and data scientists know how to work with data at scale. Therefore, itâs not surprising that Data Engineering skills showed a solid 29% increase from 2023 to 2024. SQL, the common language of all database work, is up 3.2%; Power BI was up 3.0%, along with the more general (and much smaller) topic Business Intelligence (up 5.0%). PostgreSQL is close to edging ahead of MySQL, with a 3.6% gain. Interest in Data Lake architectures rose 59%, while the much older Data Warehouse held steady, with a 0.3% decline. (In our skill taxonomy, Data Lake includes Data Lakehouse, a data storage architecture that combines features of data lakes and data warehouses.) Finally, ETL grew 102%. With the exception of ETL, the gains are smaller than the increases we saw for AI skills, but that makes sense: AI is an exciting new area, and data is a mature, stable category. The number of people who need specialized skills like ETL is relatively small but obviously growing as data storage becomes even more important with AI. Itâs worth understanding the connection between data engineering, data lakes, and data lakehouses. Data engineers build the infrastructure to collect, store, and analyze data. The data needed for an AI application almost always takes many forms: free-form text, images, audio, structured data (for example, financial statements), etc. Data often arrives in streams, asynchronously and more or less constantly. This is a good match for a data lake, which stores data regardless of structure for use later. Because data receives only minimal processing when it arrives, it can be stored in near real time; itâs cleaned and formatted in application-specific ways when itâs needed. Once data has been stored in a data lake, it can be used for traditional business analytics, stored in a vector or graph database for RAG, or put to almost any other use. A data lakehouse combines both structured and unstructured data in a single platform. What do software developers do all day? They write software. Programming is an important part of the job, but itâs not the whole thing; best estimates are that programmers spend roughly 20% of their time writing code. The rest of their time is spent understanding the problems theyâre being asked to solve, designing appropriate solutions, documenting their work, updating management on the status of their projects, and much more. Software architecture, which focuses on understanding a customerâs requirements and designing systems to meet those requirements, is an important part of the overall software development picture. Itâs a skill to which many of our software developers and programmers aspire. This yearâs data shows that software architecture continues to be one of the most desirable skills in the industries we serve. Usage of material about Software Architecture rose 5.5% from 2023 to 2024, a small but significant increase. But itâs more important to ask why it increased. A position in software architecture may be perceived as more secure in a time of layoffs, and itâs often perceived as another step forward in a career that moves from junior programmer to senior to lead. In addition, the rise of AI presents many architectural challenges: Do we try to build our own model? (The answer is usually âno.â) Should we use an AI service provider like OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, or Google, or should we fine-tune and host our own model on our own infrastructure? How do we build applications that are safe (and how do we define âsafeâ)? How do we evaluate performance? These questions all have a bearing on software architecture. Furthermore, AI might provide tools to help software architects, but so far, these tools can do little for the substance of the job: understanding customersâ needs and helping them define what they want to build. With AI in the picture, weâre all building new kinds of applicationsâand those applications require architects to help design them. In this context, itâs no surprise that Enterprise Architecture is up 17% and Distributed Systems is up 35%. Enterprise architecture is a staple: As Willie Sutton said about banks, âThatâs where the money is.â Itâs a good bet that many enterprises are trying to integrate AI into their systems or update legacy systems that are no longer scalable or maintainable. We can (and do) make the same argument about distributed systems. Modern enterprises work on a scale that was unimaginable a few decades ago. Scale isnât just for companies like Amazon and Google. To survive, even small businesses need to develop an online presenceâand that means building systems in the cloud that can handle surges in demand gracefully. It means building systems that can withstand outages. Distributed systems arenât just massive deployments with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Your business may only require a dozen nodes, but regardless of the scale, it still faces the architectural challenges that come with distributed systems. Some of the more significant ideas from the past decade seem to be falling out of favor. Microservices declined 24%, though content use is still substantial. Domain-Driven Design, which is an excellent skill for designing with microservices, is down 22%. Serverless is down 5%; this particular architectural style was widely hyped and seemed like a good match for microservices but never really caught on, at least based on our platformâs data. Whatâs happening? Microservice architectures are difficult to design and implement, and they arenât always appropriateâfrom the start, the best advice has been to begin by building a monolith, then break the monolith into microservices when it becomes unwieldy. By the time you reach that stage, youâll have a better feel for what microservices need to be broken out from the monolith. Thatâs good advice, but the hype got ahead of it. Many organizations that would never need the complexity of microservices were trying to implement them with underskilled staff. As an architectural style, microservices wonât disappear, but theyâre no longer getting the attention they once were. And new ideas, like modular monoliths, may catch on in the coming years; modularity is a virtue regardless of scale or complexity. Last yearâs report showed that our users were consuming less content about programming languages. This yearâs data continues that trend. We see a small drop for Python (5.3%) and a more significant drop for Java (13%). And even C++, which showed healthy growth from 2022 to 2023, is down 9% in 2024. On the other hand, C is up (1.3%), and so is C# (2.1%). Rust is up 9.6%. The small increases in C and C# may just be noise. C is well-entrenched and isnât going anywhere fast. Neither is C++, despite its drop. Rustâs increase continues a growth trend that stretches back several years; thatâs an important signal. Rust is clearly winning over developers, at least for new projects. Now that the US government is placing a priority on memory safety, Rustâs emphasis on memory safety serves it well. Rust isnât the first programming language to claim memory safety, nor will it be the last. (There are projects to add memory safety to C++, for example.) But right now, itâs the best positioned. Aside from Rust, though, we need to ask whatâs happening with programming skills. A few forces are applying downward pressure. Industry-wide layoffs may be playing a role. Weâve downplayed the effect of layoffs in the past, but we may have to admit that we were wrong: This year, they may be taking a bite out of skills development. Could generative AI have had an effect on the development of programming language skills? Itâs possible; shortly after GPT-3 was released, Simon Willison reported that he was learning Rust with the help of ChatGPT and Copilot, and more recently that heâs used Claude to write Rust code that he has in production, even though he doesnât consider himself a skilled Rust developer. It would be foolish to deny that generative AI will help programmers to become more productive. And it would be foolish to deny that AI will change how and what we learn. But we have to think carefully about what âlearningâ means, and why we learn in the first place. Programmers wonât have to remember all the little details of programming languagesâbut thatâs never been the important part of programming, nor has rote memorization been an important part of learning. Students will never have to remember a half dozen sorting algorithms, but computer science classes donât teach sorting algorithms because committing algorithms to memory is important. Every programming language has a sort() function somewhere in its libraries. No, sorting is taught because itâs a problem that everyone can understand and that can be solved in several different waysâand each solution has different properties (performance, memory use, etc.). The point is learning how to solve problems and understanding the properties of those solutions. As Claire Vo said in her episode of Generative AI in the Real World, weâll always need engineers who think like engineersâand thatâs what learning how to solve problems means. Whether lines end in a semicolon or a colon or whether you use curly braces, end statements, or tabs to delimit blocks of code is immaterial. The perception that generative AI minimizes the need to learn programming languages may limit the use of language-oriented content on our platform. Does that benefit the learners? If someone is using AI to avoid learning the hard conceptsâlike solving a problem by dividing it into smaller pieces (like quicksort)âthey are shortchanging themselves. Shortcuts rarely pay off in the long term; coding assistants may help you to write some useful code, but those who use them merely as shortcuts rather than as learning tools are missing the point. Unfortunately, the history of teachingâgoing back centuries if not millenniaâhas stressed memorization. Itâs time for both learners and teachers to grow beyond that. Learning is changing as a result of AI. The way we teach, and the way our users want to be taught, is changing. Building the right kind of experiences to facilitate learning in an AI-enabled environment is an ongoing project for our learning platform. In the future, will our users learn to program by completing AI-generated tutorials that are customized in real time to their needs and abilities? Thatâs where weâre headed. Use of content about web programming skills is down, with few exceptions. A number of factors might be contributing to this. First, I canât think of any significant new web frameworks in the past year; the field is still dominated by React (down 18%) and Angular (down 10%). There is some life near the bottom of the chart. The Svelte framework had significant growth (24%); so did Next.js (8.7%). But while these frameworks have their adherents, theyâre far from dominant. PHP (down 19%) still claims to have built the lionâs share of the web, but itâs not what developers reach for when they want to build something new, particularly if that ânewâ is a complex web application. The PHP world has been rocked by a bitter fight between the CEOs of Automattic (the developers of WordPress, by far the most important PHP framework) and WP Engine (a WordPress hosting platform). That fight started too late to affect this yearâs results significantly, but it might weigh heavily next year. A more significant development has been the movement away from complex platforms and back toward the simplicity of the earlier web. Alex Russellâs âReckoningâ posts summarize many of the problems. Our networks and our computers are much, much faster than they were 20 or 25 years ago, but web performance hasnât improved noticeably. If anything, itâs gotten worse. We still wait for applications to load. Applications are hard to develop and have gotten harder over the years. There are several new frameworks that may (or may not) be lighter-weight, such as HTMX, Ludic, Glitch, and Cobalt. None of them have yet made a dent in our data, in part because none have built enough of a following for publishers and trainers to develop contentâand you canât have any units viewed if there isnât anything to view. However, if you want an experience that isnât dominated by heavyweight frameworks, doesnât require you to become a JavaScript expert, and puts the fun back into building the web, this is where to look. Web dev is a discipline that has been ill-served by shortcuts to learning. We hear too often about boot camp graduates who know a few React tricks but donât understand the difference between React and JavaScript (or even know that JavaScript exists, let alone other programming languages). These programmers are very likely to lose their jobs to AI, which can already reproduce all the basic React techniques theyâve learned. Learning providers need to think about how AI is changing the workplace and how their students can partner with AI to build something beyond what AI can build on its own. Part of the solution is certainly a return to basics, ensuring that junior developers understand the tools with which theyâre working. Operations is another area where the trends are mostly downward. It may be small consolation, but the drops for several of the most important topics are relatively small: Linux is down 1.6%, Terraform is down 4.0%, and Infrastructure as Code is down 7.3%. As a skill, Terraform seems little hurt by the fork of Terraform that created the open source OpenTofu project, perhaps because the OpenTofu developers have been careful to maintain compatibility with Terraform. How this split plays out in the future is an open question. Itâs worth noting the precipitous drop in Terraform certification (down 43%); that may be a more important signal than Terraform itself. Kubernetes is down 20%. Despite that drop, which is sharper than last yearâs 6.9% decrease, content teaching Kubernetes skills remains the second most widely used group in this category, and Kubernetes certification is up 6.3%. Last year, we said that Kubernetes needed to be simpler. It isnât. There are no viable alternatives to Kubernetes yet, but there are different ways to deploy it. Kubernetes as a service managed by a cloud provider is certainly catching on, putting the burden of understanding every detail of Kubernetesâs operation on the shoulders of the provider. We also pointed to the rise of developer platforms; this year, the buzzword is âplatform engineeringâ (Camille Fournier and Ian Nowlandâs book is excellent), but as far as Kubernetes is concerned, itâs the same thing. Platform engineers can abstract knowledge of Kubernetes into a platform, minimizing software developersâ cognitive overhead. The result is that the number of people who need to know about Kubernetes is smaller. Both DevOps (down 23%) and SRE (down 15%) dropped. Thereâs certainly some frustration with DevOps: Has it paid off? We ask a different question: Has it ever been tried? One problem with DevOps (which it shares with Agile) is that many companies âadoptedâ it in name but not in essence. They renamed a few positions, hired a few DevOps engineers, maybe created a DevOps group, never realizing that DevOps wasnât about new job titles or new specialties; it was about reducing the friction between software development teams and operations teams. When you look at it this way, creating new groups and hiring new specialists can only be counterproductive. And the result is predictable: You donât have to look far to find blogs and whitepapers claiming that DevOps doesnât work. Thereâs also frustration with ideas like âshift leftâ and DevSecOps, which envision taking security into account from the start of the development process. Security is a different discussion, but itâs unclear how you build secure systems without taking it into account from the start. Weâve spent several decades building software and trying to fold security in at the last minuteâwe know how well that works. In any case, the industry has moved on. Platform engineering is, in many ways, a natural outgrowth of both DevOps and SRE. As Iâve argued, the course of operations has been to increase the ratio of computers to operators. Is platform engineering the next step, allowing software developers to build systems that can handle their own deployment and routine operations without the help of operations staff? General IT certifications, apart from security, trended downward. Use of content to prepare for the CompTIA A+ exam, an entry-level IT certification, was down 15%; CompTIA Network+ was down 7.9%. CompTIAâs Linux+ exam held its own, with a decline of 0.3%. On our platform, weâve seen that Linux resources are in high demand. The slight decline for Linux-related content (1.6%) fits with the very small decrease in Linux+ certification. For many years, Ciscoâs certifications have been the gold standard for IT. Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), a fairly general entry-level IT certification, showed the greatest usage and the smallest decline (2.2%). Usage of content to prepare for the Cisco Certified Network Practitioner (CCNP) exams, a cluster of related certifications on topics like enterprise networking, data centers, and security, dropped 17%. The Cisco Certified Internet Engineer (CCIE) exams showed the greatest decline (36%). CCIE has long been recognized as the most comprehensive and in-depth IT certification. Weâre not surprised that the total usage of this content is relatively small. CCIE represents the climax of a career, not the start. The number of people who attain it is relatively small, and those who do often include their CCIE number with their credentials. But the drop is surprising. Itâs certainly true that IT is less focused on heavy-duty routing and switching for on-prem data centers (or even smaller machine rooms) than it was a few years ago. That work has largely been offloaded to cloud providers. While routers and switches havenât disappeared, IT doesnât need to support as wide a range of resources: They need to support office WiFi, some databases that need to remain on-premises, and maybe a few servers for office-related tasks. Theyâre very concerned about security, and as weâll see shortly, security certifications are thriving. Is it possible that Cisco and its certifications arenât as relevant as they used to be? As we mentioned above, we also saw a drop in the relatively new certification for HashiCorpâs Terraform (43%). Thatâs a sharp declineâparticularly since use of content about Terraform itself only declined 4.0%, showing that Terraform skills remain highly desirable regardless of the certification. A sudden drop in certification prep can be caused by a new exam, making older content out-of-date, but that isnât the case here. Terraform certification certainly wasnât helped by HashiCorpâs switch to a Business Source License or the subsequent fork of the Terraform project. IBMâs pending acquisition of Terraform (set to close before the end of 2024) may have introduced more uncertainty. Is the decline in interest for Terraform certification an indicator of dissatisfaction in the Terraform community? The Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA, up 6.3%) was a bright spot in IT certification. Whether or not Kubernetes is overly complex (perhaps because itâs overly complex) and whether or not companies are moving out of the cloud, KCNA certification is a worthwhile asset. Cloud native applications arenât going away. And whether theyâre managing Kubernetes complexity by building developer platforms, using a Kubernetes provider, or using some other solution, companies will need people on their staff who can demonstrate that they have Kubernetes skills. Content use for the major cloud providers and their certifications was down across all categories, with one exception: Use of content to prepare for Google Cloud certifications is up 2.2%. What does that tell us, if anything? Are we looking at a âcloud repatriationâ movement in full swing? Are our customers moving their operations back from the cloud to on-prem (or hosted) data centers? Last year, we said that we see very little evidence that repatriation is happening. This year? An article in The New Stack argues that cloud repatriation is gathering steam. While that might account for the decline in the use of cloud-related content, we still see little evidence that repatriation is actually happening. Two case studies (37signals and GEICO) donât make a trend. The ongoing expense of operating software in the cloud probably is greater than the cost of running it on-premises. But the cloud allows for scaling on demand, and thatâs important. Itâs true, few businesses have the sudden usage peaks that are driven by events like retailâs Black Friday. But the cloud providers arenât just about sudden 10x or 100x bursts of traffic; they also allow you to scale smoothly from 1x to 1.5x to 2x to 3x, and so on. It saves you from arguing that you need additional infrastructure until the need becomes a crisis, at which point, you donât need to grow 1.5x; you need 5x. After moving operations to the cloud and experiencing a few years of growthâeven if that growth is moderateâmoving back to an on-premises data center will require significant capital expense. It will probably require gutting all the infrastructure that you havenât been using for the past year and replacing it with something up-to-date. Does this mean that cloud providers are âroach motels,â where you can move in but you canât move out? Thatâs not entirely untrue. But the ease of scaling by allocating a few more servers and seeing a slightly higher bill the next month canât be ignored, even if those slightly higher bills sound like the proverbial story of boiling the frog. Evaluating vendors, waiting for delivery, installing hardware, configuring hardware, testing hardwareâthatâs effort and expense that businesses are offloading to cloud vendors. The ability to scale fluidly is particularly important in the age of AI. Few companies have the skills needed to build on-premises infrastructure for AI, with its cooling and power requirements. That means either buying AI services directly from cloud providers or building infrastructure to host your own models. And of course, the cloud providers have plenty of help for companies that need to use their high-end GPUs. (Seriouslyâif you want to host your AI application on-premises, see how long it will take to get delivery of NVIDIAâs latest GPU.) The reality, as IDC concluded in a survey of cloud use, is that âworkload repatriation from public cloud into dedicated environments goes hand in hand with workload migration to public cloud activities, reflecting organizationsâ continuous reassessment of IT environments best suited for serving their workloads.â That is, thereâs a constant ebb and flow of workloads to and from public clouds as companies adapt their strategies to the business environment. The buzzword power of âthe cloudâ lasted longer than anyone could reasonably have expected, but itâs dead now. However, thatâs just the buzzword. Companies may no longer be âmoving to the cloudâ; that move has already happened, and their staff no longer need to learn how to do it. Organizations now need to learn how to manage the investments theyâve made. They need to learn which workloads are most appropriate for the cloud and which are better run on-premises. IT still needs staff with cloud skills. Security Governance drove the most content use in 2024, growing 7.3% in the process and overtaking Network Security (down 12%). The rise of governance is an important sign: âSecurityâ is no longer an ad hoc issue, fixing vulnerabilities in individual applications or specific services. That approach leads to endless firefighting and eventually failureâand those failures end up in the major news media and result in executives losing their jobs. Security is a company-wide issue that needs to be addressed in every part of the organization. Confirming the growing importance of security governance, interest in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) grew 44%, and Compliance grew 10%. Both are key parts of security governance. Security architecture also showed a small but significant increase (3.7%); designing a security architecture that works for an entire organization is an important part of looking at the overall security picture. The use of content about Application Security also grew significantly (17%). Thatâs a very general topic, and it perhaps doesnât say much except that our users are interested in securing their applicationsâwhich goes without saying. But what kinds of applications? All of them: web applications, cloud applications, business intelligence applications, everything. We get a bigger signal from the increase in Zero Trust (13%), a particularly important strategy for securing services in which every user, human or otherwise, must authenticate itself to every service that it uses. In addition, users must have appropriate privileges to do what they need to do, and no more. Itâs particularly important that zero trust extends authentication to nonhuman users (other computers and other services, whether internal or external). Itâs a response to the âhard, crunchy outside, but soft chewy insideâ security that dominated the 1990s and early 2000s. Zero trust assumes that attackers can get through firewalls, that they can guess passwords, and that they can compromise phones and computers when theyâre outside the firewall. Firewalls, good passwords, and multifactor authentication systems are all importantâtheyâre the hard, crunchy outside that prevents an attacker from getting in. Zero trust helps keep attackers outside, of courseâbut more than that, it limits the damage they can do once theyâre inside. Weâre puzzled by the drop in use of content about Network Security, which corresponds roughly to the drop in Cisco certifications. Network Security is still the second most widely used skill, but itâs down 12% from 2023 to 2024. Perhaps network security isnât deemed as important when employees wander in and out of company networks and applications are distributed between in-house servers and the cloud. We hope that our users arenât making that mistake. A bigger issue is that networks havenât changed much in the past few years: Weâre still using IPv4; weâre still using routers, switches, and firewalls, none of which have changed significantly in recent years. What has changed is the way security is implemented. Cloud computing and zero trust have moved the focus from big-iron networking devices to interactions between systems, regardless of how they are connected. Security certification has been one of the biggest growth areas on our platform. As Iâve said elsewhere, security professionals love their certifications. Thereâs a good reason for that. In most other specialties, itâs possible to build a portfolio of programs you wrote, systems you architected, sites youâve designed. What can a security person say in a job interview? âI stopped 10,000 people from logging in last year?â If youâve ever monitored a public-facing Linux system, you know that claim means little. Security is cursed with the problem that the best news is no news: âNothing bad happenedâ doesnât play well with management or future employers. Neither does âI kept all the software patched, and spent time reading CVEs to learn about new vulnerabilitiesââeven though thatâs an excellent demonstration of competence. Certification is a way of proving that you have certain skills and that youâve met some widely recognized standards. The CISSP (up 11%) and CompTIA Security+ (up 13%) certifications are always at the top of our lists, and this year is no exception. Our State of Security in 2024 report showed that CISSP was the certification most commonly required by employers. If thereâs a gold standard for security skills, CISSP is it: Itâs a thorough, comprehensive exam for people with more than five years of experience. CompTIA Security+ certification has always trailed CISSP slightly in our surveys and in platform performance, but its position in second place is uncontested. Security+ is an entry-level certification; itâs particularly desirable for people who are starting their security careers. Security certification was especially important for government users. For most industry sectors, usage focused on programming skills in Java or Python, followed by artificial intelligence. The government sector was a strong outlier. Security and IT certifications were by far the most important topics. CompTIA Security+ and CISSP (in that order) led. Moving beyond CISSP and Security+, many of the other security certifications also showed gains. Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) was up 1.4%, as was the less popular CompTIA PenTest+ certification (3.3%). Certified Cloud Security Professional was up 2.4%, somewhat less than weâd expect, given the importance of the cloud to modern IT, but itâs still a gain. ISACAâs Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) was up 45%, Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) grew 9.3%, and Certified Information Security Auditor (CISA) was up 8.8%; these three certifications are strongly associated with security governance. The most significant declines were for the CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification (down 13%) and CCNA Security (down 55%). The drop in CCNA Security is extreme, but it isnât unexpected given that none of the Cisco certifications showed an increase this year. Weâre missing one important piece of the security certification puzzle. Thereâs no data on AI security certificationsâand thatâs because there arenât any. Software that incorporates AI must be built and operated securely. That will require security experts with AI expertise (and who can demonstrate that expertise via certifications). We expect (or maybe a better phrase is âwe hopeâ) that lack will be addressed in the coming year. Professional development continues to be an important growth area for our audience. The most important skill, Professional Communication, grew 4.5%ânot much but significant. We saw a 9.6% increase in users wanting to know more about Engineering Leadership, and a 21.5% increase in users using content about Personal Productivity. Project Management was almost unchanged from 2023 to 2024 (up 0.01%), while the use of content about the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification grew 15%. Interest in Product Management declined 11%; it seems to be a skill that our users are less interested in. Why? For the past few years, product manager has seemed to be a trendy new job title. But in last yearâs report, Product Management only showed a small gain from 2022 to 2023. Is interest in Product Management as a skill or as a job title fading? We also saw a 7.9% decline in Leadership (aside from Engineering Leadership), and a huge 35% decline for IT Management. Are we to blame these on the corporate layoff cycle? Thatâs possible, but itâs too easy. IT may be affected by a general trend toward simplification and platform engineering, as weâve discussed: A platform engineering group can do a lot to reduce cognitive overhead for developers, but it also reduces the need for IT staff. A platform engineering group doesnât have to be large; is the need for IT staff shrinking? The decline in Leadership may be because itâs a vague, nonspecific term, unlike Engineering Leadership (which is up). Engineering Leadership is concrete and itâs something our engineering-oriented audience understands. In 2024, we introduced several new features on the OâReilly learning platform, including badges, quizzes, and a new version of OâReilly Answers. What are they telling us? We started a badging program late in 2023: Users from business accounts can earn badges for taking courses and completing quizzes. We wonât go into the program details here, but since the program started, users have earned nearly 160,000 badges. Weâre still building the program, but weâre encouraged by its first year. Badges can give us more insight into what our users are learning. The most popular badges are for Python skills, followed by GPT and prompt engineering. Generative AI and machine learning are also high on the list. Kubernetes, despite its decline in units viewed, was the fourth-most-frequently-acquired badge, with almost the same number of badges earned as software architecture. Linux, SQL, professional communication, and Java rounded out the top 11. (Yes, 11âwe wanted to include Java). The difference between Java and Python is striking, given that the use of content about these skills is similar. (Python leads Java, but not by much.) Oracle has a highly regarded Java certification program, and thereâs really no equivalent for Python. Perhaps our users recognize that obtaining a Java badge is superfluous, while obtaining badges for Pythonic skills is meaningful? Quizzes are closely tied to badges: If a final quiz exists for a course or for a book, students must pass it to earn their badge. Quiz usage appears to follow the same trends as badging, though itâs premature to draw any conclusions. While a few legacy quizzes have been on the platform for a long time (and arenât connected to badging), the push to develop quizzes as part of the badging program only began in June 2024, and quiz usage is still as much a consequence of the time the quiz has been available on the platform as it is of the skill for which itâs testing. We can also look at the expertise required by the badges that were earned. All of our content is tagged with a skill level: beginner, beginner-intermediate, intermediate, intermediate-advanced, or advanced. 42% of the badges were earned for content judged to be intermediate. 33% of the badges were earned for beginner content, while only 4.4% were for advanced content. Itâs somewhat surprising that most of the badges were earned for intermediate-level content, though perhaps that makes sense given the badge programâs B2B context: For the most part, our users are professionals rather than beginners. One of our most important new features in 2024 was an upgrade to OâReilly Answers. Answers is a generative AI-powered tool that allows users to enter natural language questions and generates responses from content in our platform. Unlike most other generative AI products, Answers always provides links to the original sources its responses are based on. These citations are tracked and used to calculate author royalties and payments to publishing partners. So the obvious question is: What are our users asking? One might guess that the questions in Answers would be similar to the search terms used on the platform. (At this point, Answers and search are distinct from each other.) That guess is partly rightâand partly wrong. There are some obvious differences. Common search terms include book titles, author names, and even ISBNs; titles and author names rarely appear in Answers. The most common searches are for single words, such as âPythonâ or âJava.â (The average length of the top 5,000 searches in September 2024 was two words, for instance.) There are few single word questions in Answers (though there are some); most questions are well-formed sentences like âHow many ways can you create a string object in Java?â (The average question length was nine words.) To analyze the questions from OâReilly Answers, we essentially turned them back into single-word questions. First, we eliminated questions from a âquestion bankâ that we created to prime the pump, as it were: Rather than requiring users to write a new question, we offered a list of prewritten queries they could click on. While thereâs undoubtedly some useful signal in how the question bank was used, we were more interested in what users asked of their own volition. From the user-written questions, we created a big âbag of words,â sorted them by frequency, and eliminated stopwords. We included a lot of stopwords that arenât in most lists: words like âdataâ (what does that mean by itself?) and âchapterâ (yes, you can ask about a chapter in a book, but that doesnât tell us much). With that background in mind, what were the most common words in Answers and in searches? In order: Thereâs an obvious difference between these two lists. The Answers list consists mostly of words that could be part of longer questions. The Search list is made up of topics and skills about which one might want information. Thatâs hardly surprising or insightful. Weâve said most searches on the platform are single-word searches, which means that those words have to be stand-alone skills or topics, like Python or Java. Likewise, Answers was built to allow users to ask more detailed, in-depth questions and get focused answers from the content on our platformâso rather than seeing single word searches, weâre seeing common words from longer questions. Maybe thatâs a self-fulfilling prophecy, but itâs also showing that Answers is working the way we intended. Thereâs a little more signal here. Python and Java are the two top programming languages on both lists, but if we look at search queries, machine learning and Kubernetes are sandwiched between the two languages. That may just be a result of our usersâ experiences with services like ChatGPT. Programmers quickly learned that they can get reasonable answers to questions about Java and Python, and the prompts donât have to be very complex. My personal favorite is âHow do you flatten a list of lists in Python?,â which can be answered by most chatbots correctly but isnât meaningful to our search engine. Kubernetes raises a different question: Why is it the third-most-common search engine query but doesnât appear among the top words on Answers? (Itâs the 90th-most-common word on Answers, though the actual rank isnât meaningful.) While Kubernetes is a topic thatâs amenable to precise questions, itâs a complex tool, and coming up with precise prompts is difficult; writing a good question probably requires a good understanding of your IT infrastructure. You might need to understand how to solve your problem before you can ask a good question about how to solve your problem. A search engine doesnât face problems like this. It doesnât need additional information to return a list of resources. Then what about words like Rust and Linux, which are high on the list of common searches, but not in the top 13 for Answers? Itâs relatively easy to come up with specific questions about either of theseâor, for that matter, about SQL, AWS, or React. SQL, AWS, and Linux are reasonably close to the top of the Answers word list. If we just concern ourselves with the order in which words appear, things start to fall into place: AWS (and cloud) follow learning; they are followed by Linux, followed by SQL. Weâre not surprised that there are few questions about CISSP on Answers; itâs a certification exam, so users are more likely to want test prep material than to ask specific questions. Rust and React are still outliers, though; itâs easy to ask precise and specific questions about either of them. Rust is still unfamiliar to many of our usersâcould the explanation be that our customers want to learn Rust as a whole rather than ask specific questions that might only occur to someone whoâs already learned the language? But if you accept that, React still remains an outlier. We may know the answers next year, at which time weâll have a much longer track record with Answers. That wraps up last year. What will we see this year? Weâve given hints throughout this report. Letâs bring it all together. AI dominated the news for 2024. It will continue to do so in 2025, despite some disillusionment. For the most part, those who are disillusioned arenât the people making decisions about what products to build. While concern about jobs is understandable in a year thatâs seen significant layoffs, we donât believe that AI is âcoming for your job.â However, we do believe that the future will belong to those who learn how to use AI effectivelyâand that AI will have a profound impact on every profession, not just IT and not just âknowledge workers.â Using AI effectively isnât just about coming up with clever prompts so you can copy and paste an answer. If all you can do is prompt, copy, and paste, youâre about to become superfluous. You need to figure out how to work with AI to create something thatâs better than what the AI could do by itself. Training employees to use AI effectively is one of the best things a company can do to prepare for an AI-driven future. Companies that donât invest in training will inevitably fall behind. In the coming year, will companies build AI applications on top of the giant foundation models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini? Or will they build on top of smaller open models, many of which are based on Metaâs Llama? And in the latter case, will they run the models on-premises (which includes the use of hosting and colocation providers), or will they rent use of these open AI models as a service from various providers? In the coming year, watch carefully what happens with the small open models. They already deliver performance almost as good as the foundation models and will undoubtedly be the basis for many AI applications. And we suspect that most companies will run these models in the cloud. Security is the other significant growth area. Companies are waking up to the need to secure their data before their reputationsâand their bottom linesâare compromised. Waking up has been a long, slow process that has sunk the careers of many CEOs and CIOs, but itâs happening. Our users are studying to gain security certifications. We see companies investing in governance and putting in company-wide policies to maintain security. In this respect, AI cuts both ways. Itâs both a tool and a danger. Itâs a tool because security professionals need to watch over huge streams of data, looking for the anomalies that signal an attack; itâs a tool because AI can digest sources of information about new threats and vulnerabilities; itâs a tool because AI can automate routine tasks like report generation. But itâs also a danger. AI-enabled applications increase an organizationâs threat surface by introducing new vulnerabilities, like prompt injection, that weâre only now learning how to mitigate. We havenât yet seen a high-profile attack against AI that compromised an organizationâs ability to do business, but that will certainly happen eventuallyâmaybe in 2025. Whatever happens this year, AI will be at the center. Everyone will need to learn how to use AI effectively. AI will inevitably reshape all of our professions, but we donât yet know how; weâre only starting to get glimpses. Is that exciting or terrifying? Both.

Title: Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?

Time Published: 2025-01-13T22:00:24Z

Watch CBS News By Julia Ingram Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: January 13, 2025 / 5:00 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise. "There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America," Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. "If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE." The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas. Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71. Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years. Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues. More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position. "The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes," said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. "If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor." Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages. Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills. In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract. These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said. "Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs." Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers. The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed. "Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters," said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, "There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent." Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow. But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers. When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable. Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe. Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023. The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform. How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed "Buy American and Hire American," aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a "great program." Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would "go to war on this issue" in one X post. "I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas," Trump said. "That's why we have them."

Title: Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s: Marketing’s Role In The DEI Collapse

FILE - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the tech giant's Connect developer conference in Menlo ... [+] Park, Calif., Sept. 27, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) When Meta announced the dismantling of its DEI initiatives last week, it marked a pivotal moment in corporate America. Following similar actions by Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart, and Ford, Meta’s decision underscored a growing trend: companies stepping away from diversity programs once seen as moral and business imperatives. The fall of DEI isn’t just a reflection of its flaws — it’s a cautionary tale for marketers about the dangers of oversimplifying complex issues. Marketing doomed corporate DEI initiatives by overpromising transformation and underdelivering results, exposing structural flaws that left these programs vulnerable to criticism and collapse. While economic pressures, legal risks and cultural debates accelerated this retreat, the deeper issue lies within DEI itself. By focusing too narrowly on representation metrics and creating expectations that were nearly impossible to meet, DEI often fell short of addressing systemic inequities. Marketing’s role in amplifying these shortcomings further accelerated DEI’s decline. By elevating lofty promises without actionable results, marketers unintentionally highlighted the limitations of DEI — leaving it open to widespread skepticism. This reckoning leaves marketers and business leaders grappling with urgent questions: What went wrong with DEI? How can companies rebuild trust with stakeholders? And what frameworks can drive meaningful, sustainable change? These questions lie at the heart of this article and the broader discussion to come. From the beginning, DEI was a concept with structural weaknesses that made it difficult to implement meaningfully. While its goals were admirable, its execution left much to be desired. For many organizations, DEI became synonymous with increasing demographic diversity. While representation is an important component of equity, it’s not the whole picture. DEI programs measured success by demographic counts but ignored systemic issues like pay inequities or biased workplace culture. A 2019 study published in the Harvard Business Review found that while 75% of companies conducted unconscious bias training as part of their DEI efforts, only 25% reported any measurable improvements in workplace equity or inclusion metrics. Similarly, a 2022 report by the Society for Human Resource Management highlighted that most DEI programs failed to close pay gaps or address structural inequities, emphasizing the need for deeper systemic change. While DEI was framed as a moral imperative, its return on investment was rarely clear. Leaders struggled to connect representation or training programs to tangible business outcomes like productivity, innovation, or employee satisfaction. Without this clarity, DEI became an easy target during times of economic belt-tightening. DEI often positioned itself as a solution to deep social problems, but its prescriptive and moralistic tone alienated some employees and customers. Instead of cultivating inclusion, DEI messaging often deepened divides, as critics viewed it as tokenistic or overly political. At its core, DEI focused too narrowly on representation without addressing universal human needs — such as belonging (feeling part of a community), security (physical and psychological safety), and empowerment (having the tools and autonomy to thrive) — that are essential for cultivating trust, connection, and engagement across stakeholders. Marketing played a crucial role in turning DEI into a public-facing initiative, but in doing so, it also exposed the framework’s shortcomings. Poorly executed campaigns often exacerbated the perception that DEI was superficial or performative, undermining its credibility. Marketers often elevated DEI as a transformative solution. But when companies failed to back these promises with meaningful action, the messaging rang hollow. Amazon promoted its commitment to workforce diversity through marketing campaigns and public updates, but reports of inequities in warehouse conditions and a lack of diversity in leadership revealed a disconnect between its messaging and reality. Many campaigns relied on surface-level symbolism—like diverse imagery or token representation—without addressing systemic issues. The Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad, which trivialized the Black Lives Matter movement, became a lightning rod for criticism because it highlighted the disconnect between corporate intentions and public perception. Similarly, Heineken faced backlash for a tone-deaf ad that seemed to imply ‘lighter is better,’ while H&M drew outrage for featuring a Black child in a hoodie labeled ‘Coolest Monkey in the Jungle. By reducing complex social issues to easily digestible slogans, marketing often made DEI feel shallow. These campaigns ignored the nuances of inclusion, creating skepticism from both employees and consumers. Starbucks’ 2015 ‘Race Together’ campaign, which encouraged baristas to start conversations about race with customers, was widely criticized as naïve and performative. In focusing on surface-level identity over substance, marketers missed the opportunity to address consumers’ functional, emotional, and social needs holistically. By 2024, the corporate retreat from DEI was in full swing, driven by a combination of external pressures and internal failures. The fallout exposed deep flaws in the framework, as well as the dangers of superficial marketing efforts tied to it. Layoffs in DEI departments became widespread as companies faced economic headwinds. At the same time, the legal risks associated with affirmative action and diversity quotas, compounded by the shifting political landscape after the contentious 2024 elections, made these initiatives less appealing to executives. Without clear business outcomes to justify DEI’s continuation, it became an easy target for budget cuts. As DEI programs faltered, employees became disillusioned. They saw little progress in areas like pay equity or career advancement, leading to disengagement. At the same time, consumers grew wary of performative gestures and empty promises. The disconnect between internal practices and external marketing left both groups feeling betrayed. A 2024 report by Edelman highlighted that 63% of employees felt their company’s public-facing DEI messaging did not reflect their internal workplace experiences, while 58% of consumers expressed distrust toward brands that failed to show tangible progress on equity initiatives. The public dismantling of DEI programs by major corporations like Meta, Amazon, McDonald’s, Walmart and Ford is emblematic of the broader retreat — feeding perceptions that corporate commitments to diversity and inclusion are fragile. This backlash underscores a key takeaway for marketers and business leaders: initiatives that fail to deliver meaningful results risk alienating their audiences. To move forward, marketers must rethink their approach to addressing societal challenges and adopt frameworks that prioritize authenticity, systemic change, and universal human needs. DEI’s downfall illustrates the risk of reducing systemic issues to branding exercises. Marketers must avoid turning social challenges into shallow campaigns and instead focus on aligning messaging with meaningful internal action. Marketing efforts should reflect internal realities. Before launching campaigns, companies must align messaging with internal practices, like pay equity and workplace culture. When the internal foundation is strong, external efforts resonate more deeply with audiences. The future of corporate responsibility isn’t about hitting representation targets—it’s about addressing universal human needs like belonging, trust, and well-being. By focusing on systemic outcomes rather than identity-based metrics, marketers can create campaigns that resonate broadly and drive real impact. DEI’s demise wasn’t inevitable, but it was predictable. Structural flaws and poorly executed marketing turned a promising idea into a polarizing and ineffective framework. For marketers, this is a moment of reckoning — not just to avoid the mistakes of DEI, but to redefine how businesses tackle societal challenges. Marketing doomed corporate DEI by overpromising transformation and delivering superficial results. The way forward isn’t about abandoning the ideals behind DEI, but evolving them into frameworks that drive real impact. This shift is critical — not just for connecting with consumers, but for creating workplaces and communities where everyone can thrive. DEI may be dead, but its lessons offer marketers a blueprint for building trust and driving meaningful impact. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Sonos CEO Patrick Spence steps down after disastrous app launch
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342179/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-resignation-reason-app
Time Published: 2025-01-13T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the job today, effective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the role of interim CEO. It’s the most dramatic development yet in an eight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time in Sonos’ history. The company’s decision to prematurely release a buggy, completely overhauled new app back in May — with crucial features missing at launch — outraged customers and kicked off a monthslong domino effect that included layoffs, a sharp decline in employee morale, and a public apology tour. The Sonos Ace headphones, rumored to be the whole reason behind the hurried app, were immediately overshadowed by the controversy, and my sources tell me that sales numbers remain dismal. Sonos’ community forums and subreddit have been dominated by complaints and an overwhelmingly negative sentiment since the spring. In October, Sonos tried to get a handle on the situation, which, by then, had spiraled into a full-on PR disaster, by outlining a turnaround plan. The company vowed to strengthen product development principles, increase transparency internally, and take other steps that it said would prevent any mistake of this magnitude from ever happening again. I can also report for the first time that Sonos hired a crisis management public relations firm to help navigate the ordeal. But three months later, Sonos’ board of directors and Spence have concluded that those steps weren’t enough: the app debacle has officially cost Spence his job. No other changes are being made today, however. So for now, chief product officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, who some employees have privately told me deserves a fair share of the blame for recent missteps, will remain in his role. “We’re going to initiate a search for the next CEO, and we’ll work on finding a leader who’s going to continue to build on our legacy and work with the team to move the company forward,” Sonos spokesperson Erin Pategas told me by phone on Sunday afternoon. She described the leadership change as “turning a page on the chapter that we’re in and forging a path ahead that gets us in the direction that we want to be going for ourselves and our customers.” In case you were wondering, that direction will not include a return to the old Sonos app; Pategas said the company remains fully committed to the new software, which has received a slew of bug fixes and gradually added back previous features over the last several months. It’s gotten better, but even this far along, complaints remain about speakers randomly vanishing from the app and other problems. Spence joined Sonos in 2012 as chief commercial officer. As CEO, he oversaw a wide range of successful hardware products: Sonos released several impressive soundbars (including the still-new Arc Ultra), pushed into portable audio with the Move and Roam, and debuted the forward-looking Era 300 spatial audio speaker. But the app stumbles — and Spence’s failure to apologize in the immediate aftermath — ultimately soured his reputation with the company’s most loyal customers. There was no overcoming that. Spence will technically remain with Sonos until June 30th of this year, during which time he’ll receive a base salary of $7,500 per month for providing the company with “strategic advisory services.” And when that end date rolls around, he’ll be granted a severance of $1,875,000. Those numbers come from an 8K filing that Sonos made with the SEC regarding today’s news. In my time at The Verge, I’ve covered Sonos more comprehensively (and I’d like to think fairly) than any other company. Yes, that includes a long list of product leaks, but I’m far more interested in shining a light on all the frustrations caused by the new app — both for customers and staff — and the bad decisions that led Sonos off the tracks. Those choices have had repercussions for ordinary employees who gave their best to the brand. If you have more to share about the last year at Sonos, please reach out to me confidentially and securely over Signal at (845) 445-8455 or chriswelch.01. I can also be reached via DM on Bluesky, X, or Instagram. It now falls on Conrad, who joined the Sonos board in 2017, to rally disenchanted employees and make good on winning back consumer trust. Conrad’s career includes a 10-year tenure as chief technology officer at Pandora and two years as VP of product at Snapchat. He worked on Apple’s Finder software during the ’90s. Most recently, Conrad served as chief product officer for the ill-fated Quibi streaming service. Pategas believes he’s a great fit for the interim CEO position because he’s keenly aware of the company’s current predicament; Conrad and chief innovation officer Nick Millington have already been spearheading Sonos’ fix-the-app effort for months. Despite this seismic shift at the top, Sonos’ future product pipeline remains “full steam ahead,” Pategas told me. The company’s next major new product is rumored to be a streaming video player, which would pit it against the likes of Apple, Roku, Amazon, and Google in the living room. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Notable Business Negotiations of 2024

Time Published: 2025-01-13T10:00:38Z

PON – Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School - https://www.pon.harvard.edu By Katie Shonk — on January 13th, 2025 / Business Negotiations For corporate dealmakers, 2024 was a relatively slow year. Yet several notable business negotiations and conflict resolution decisions captured headlines and offered lessons for negotiators across sectors. Let’s take a look at 10 that stood out: Discover step-by-step techniques for avoiding common business negotiation pitfalls when you download a copy of the FREE special report, Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals, from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. 10. A failed succession plan. In December, a Nevada commissioner ruled against media mogul Rupert Murdoch in his efforts to cement control of his family trust with his eldest son, Lachlan. According to the commissioner, Edmund J. Gorman Jr., Murdoch and Lachlan acted in “bad faith” in their attempt to alter the irrevocable trust, which will divide control of Murdoch’s empire among his four oldest children—Lachlan, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence—upon his death. Murdoch, 93, was motivated to elevate Lachlan to a permanent leadership role to ensure that his media holdings will maintain their conservative bent. In December, Murdoch launched a long-shot effort to overturn the ruling. 9. Salaries lag in WNBA. Interest in women’s basketball has skyrocketed in recent years, thanks to the rise of superstar Caitlin Clark and other top players. Yet many were surprised to hear that Clark’s starting salary in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is only about $76,500, a small fraction of what male players earn in the NBA. While Clark earns the bulk of her income from endorsements, many WNBA players supplement their relatively low salaries by playing on foreign teams in the offseason. As profits rise in women’s basketball, it will become more difficult for WNBA teams to continue to justify low salaries. It’s one of many fields in which women face an uphill battle in salary negotiations. 8. Taking the salty with the sweet. In August, chocolate-maker Mars announced a planned $35.9 billion acquisition of snack-maker Kellanova, whose brands include Cheez-It, Pringles, and Eggo. Privately owned Mars, which produces M&M’s and Snickers candy bars, has been expanding beyond its core business with recent acquisitions, including the maker of KIND bars and pet food brand IAMS. The diversification deal comes amid volatility in the food market, as some consumers resist recent rises in grocery prices. 7. Boeing’s troubles mount. Boeing’s ongoing business and ethical crisis was exacerbated by a seven-week strike by 33,000 of its machinists in 2024. With the union workers on the picket lines, Boeing halted production of its 737, 777, and 767 jets at an estimated cost of $5 billion. The workers went on strike after rejecting a contract that promised a 25% pay raise over four years. After threatening mass layoffs, Boeing, led by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, ultimately offered the machinists a pay hike of 38% over four years. A majority of the workers voted to ratify the new contract. At year’s end, strikes by Amazon and Starbucks workers further highlighted workers’ attempts to gain leverage through collective action. 6. Upscale retail consolidates. Two 2024 deals aimed to help pull the luxury retail market out of its downward slide amid competition from fast-fashion leaders Walmart, Amazon, and others. In July, HBC, the parent company of department store Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed to acquire Neiman Marcus, which had filed for bankruptcy protection during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Times reports. The acquisition positions the new retail group, Saks Global, as the industry leader, with a total of 74 stores and 100 outlets. And in December, the Nordstrom family and a Mexican retail group cemented a $6.25 billion deal to purchase department store Nordstrom and take it private. With sales at Nordstrom having “flatlined” in the past decade, according to the Associated Press, the new owners plan to invest in the business without the pressure to show short-term profits. 5. Google under fire. In August, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 18 U.S. states that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly with its online search engine. Then in December, to open up Google’s Android app store to increased competition, Judge James Donato ordered Google to allow app developers to offer their own app stores on Android devices in exchange for a “reasonable fee.” The landmark decision could trigger a wave of antitrust lawsuits against tech companies. 4. Mixing business and politics. The rich and the powerful exerted their influence throughout the long and tumultuous U.S. presidential election of 2024. After Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance opposite Donald Trump on June 27, Democratic politicians, business leaders, and movie stars worked behind the scenes and in front of the camera to try to convince the president to bow out of the race. While their negotiation campaign succeeded, the switch in candidates to Kamala Harris failed to deliver Democrats a victory. After Trump was reelected, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of his biggest donors, and other Silicon Valley leaders successfully jockeyed to secure high-level positions in his administration. 3. An up-and-down media deal. In July, Paramount Global agreed to merge with entertainment studio Skydance in what DealBook called “the most tumultuous media deal in years.” Paramount’s business, which includes CBS and Viacom, had been on a “roller coaster” brought on by the loss of cable customers and significant debt, according to CNBC. On-again, off-again negotiations with Skydance culminated in an $8.4 billion deal, backed by private equity firms. The merger negotiations raised the issue of when to agree to an exclusivity period. 2. AI investments. In 2024, tech companies jostled to bring artificial intelligence (AI) tools to market. Amazon invested $12 billion in generative AI start-up Anthropic over 14 months, and Apple and Nvidia were in talks to back OpenAI as part of a deal that valued the AI leader at $100 billion. U.S. regulators are looking closely at the investments, which allow tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to “form deep ties with their smaller rivals while avoiding most government scrutiny,” according to the Times. But the White House actually played matchmaker in one deal, pushing Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in G42 after the Emirati AI company agreed to try to keep Chinese intelligence agencies from infiltrating its systems. 1. A sluggish year for mergers. Merger and acquisition (M&A) deals fell 18% in 2024, even as the dollar volume of deals rose 9% to $3 trillion, the London Stock Exchange Group reports. High interest rates and inflation kept deal financing costs high, and the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) tough antitrust enforcement put a damper on dealmaking. Court rulings blocked the merger of JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines, as well as Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of rival grocery chain Albertsons. Corporate dealmakers anticipated that Trump’s pick for FTC chief, Andrew Ferguson, would take a more hands-off approach to M&A negotiations than his predecessor, Lina Khan, though Ferguson is expected to crack down on Big Tech, DealBook reports.

Title: The Great Tech Reset: Unpacking The Layoff Surge Of 2024

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/12/2025 8:31:25 AM PST by wildcard_redneck In a stunning reversal, the tech industry—once the unstoppable engine of modern innovation—has laid off over 124,000 workers in 2024 alone. What’s driving this wave of layoffs, and what does it mean for the future of work in one of the world’s most dynamic sectors? The Layoff Landscape In August 2024, Intel sent shockwaves through the market by announcing a 15% reduction in its global workforce—roughly 15,000 jobs. Just days later, Cisco Systems announced plans to lay off 7% of its employees, marking its second round of job cuts this year as the company shifts focus to rapidly growing areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Earlier in February 2024, Cisco laid off more than 4,000 employees. These are not isolated incidents. According to Layoffs.fyi, 384 tech companies have laid off more than 124,000 employees in 2024, adding to the 428,449 tech workers who lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023. While the broader labor market has shown some resilience, the tech sector's cuts are particularly visible due to the sheer scale of these companies. Even a small percentage reduction translates to thousands of lives and families upended. (Excerpt) Read more at forbes.com ...

Corporations or businesses, do not exist for the purposes of just creating work. If DOGE is okay for government, the private sector equivalent should be just as welcome. When a business operates efficiently and the need for workers decreases, then, layoffs will occur. The need for H1Bs should also decrease; layoffs is not the same as replacing regular American workers with H1B workers. Reductions in staffs is a worldwide situation. Only government creates jobs for the sake of employing more people (while making the government leaders look good) and not because they're needed. 7 posted on 01/12/2025 8:45:36 AM PST by adorno ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Carry_Okie Eh, not so sure about AI. I do know that Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc. have spent over $100 BILLION in 2023-2024 on AI infrastructure. If they don’t start getting some astounding customer $$$ from using AI soon, all that money is going to be a total write-off. (Because Moore’s Law, and the next generation of chips having twice the price performance, your competitor can buy the next gen chips and undercut you on price...*if* even they can break even.) AI is plagiarism in the rear-view mirror, a solution looking for a problem. There are a few coding types which can trivailly be done by AI: but many simply cannot, and coders report increased time by 30% or so, trying to get the prompts “just right” so that the code will do what is actually required, or without hallucinations. But when all the low-hanging fruit is taken, will the lack of demand doom AI because of the costs?

Earlier in February 2024, Cisco laid off more than 4,000 employees. These are not isolated incidents.

While the broader labor market has shown some resilience, the tech sector's cuts are particularly visible due to the sheer scale of these companies.

According to Layoffs.fyi, 384 tech companies have laid off more than 124,000 employees in 2024, adding to the 428,449 tech workers who lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023. While the broader labor market has shown some resilience, the tech sector's cuts are particularly visible due to the sheer scale of these companies. Even a small percentage reduction translates to thousands of lives and families upended. (Excerpt) Read more at forbes.com ... It needs to end. Concur. An accurate assessment. A lot of these layoffs (this time...) is companies shedding the useless DEI hires and cutting staff bloat - see all the people so proud about working at a Silicon Valley company where they only had to work 4 hours a day and had this in-office wine bar that they hung out at for hours. Or worse, the above, but the 4 hours was spent on ensuring proper workforce diversity. Learn to code? Now AI will eat those careers alive. Capital replaces labor. To those who love low interest rates, making capital cheap to borrow has its consequences. I know it makes for more investments, but expensive borrowing does focus it upon those uses that provide a real profit. Capital replaces labor. To those who love low interest rates, making capital cheap to borrow has its consequences. I know it makes for more investments, but expensive borrowing does focus it upon those uses that provide a real profit. BFLR Eh, not so sure about AI. I do know that Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc. have spent over $100 BILLION in 2023-2024 on AI infrastructure. If they don’t start getting some astounding customer $$$ from using AI soon, all that money is going to be a total write-off. (Because Moore’s Law, and the next generation of chips having twice the price performance, your competitor can buy the next gen chips and undercut you on price...*if* even they can break even.) AI is plagiarism in the rear-view mirror, a solution looking for a problem. There are a few coding types which can trivailly be done by AI: but many simply cannot, and coders report increased time by 30% or so, trying to get the prompts “just right” so that the code will do what is actually required, or without hallucinations. But when all the low-hanging fruit is taken, will the lack of demand doom AI because of the costs? The tech bros are blinded by their own marketing copy. Americans have been replaced in Silicon Valley.

It fits a disgusting pattern. If America is so short of talent why aren’t they hiring on the laid off people? It’s because they want indentured servants, cheap labor, and to diminish the political power of native born American citizens of all colors. They drive like a-holes too. AI is excellent at giving you boilerplate code for the more mundane, day-to-day, cookie-cutter things an application needs. These are bits and pieces of code that are common to just about any project you'd work on, and not specific to your business. Of, that, there is no question, and it pays dividends there.What AI fails at, and sometimes spectacularly, is business-centric logic. That is to say, the bits of the applications where you have to have a full working knowledge of the business side of your business. Essentially, AI makes for a great "cowboy coder," But it does a pretty poor job where working knowledge of your business is needed to produce specific code for an application or website. It falls over pretty quickly once that's introduced. Also, can you be sure that AI-Generated code is secure? You still need people who can look at the generated code to make sure it doesn’t have any security holes. .. “ in-office wine bar ”? . Heck this isn’t the 80’s, man….

In fact, for all of India, more jobs are being created,” Chandok added. There have been reports of the company cutting a small percentage (less than 1 per cent) of jobs across departments globally, based on performance. The company has around 20,000 employees in India, out of a total of 2,28,000 people worldwide. Microsoft’s latest job cuts are lower compared to past downsizing exercises. The company laid off 10,000 employees in early 2023. In January 2024, the company’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap, just three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. The news of job cuts started doing the rounds during the recent two-day visit to India by Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft. Nadella announced his company’s $3 billion investment plans for cloud and AI infrastructure over the next two years. “India is rapidly becoming a leader in AI innovation, unlocking new opportunities across the country,” Nadella had said, adding that the investments in infrastructure and skilling that he announced reaffirmed Microsoft’s commitment to making India AI-first. He said the company aims to build a thriving AI ecosystem in India by supporting the government and industry in fostering AI innovation and enhancing productivity, efficiency, and accessibility. For the same purpose, Microsoft tied up with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) under the IndiaAI Mission and also announced partnerships with companies like RailTel, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Finserv, Mahindra Group, and upGrad to accelerate AI-driven transformations in India. “We will continue to use AI to unlock possibilities for the next few decades and ensure that communities across the country have access to the compute they need to prosper in the AI era,” Chandok added. In 2023, not only Microsoft but other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Accenture, and Dell also announced job cuts of 10,000, 27,000, 19,000, and 6,650, respectively.

Title: Amazon Prime will shut down its clothing try-on program

By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Amazon will be winding down its Prime Try Before You Buy program, which let Prime members try on clothes before paying for them, reports The Information. It will shutter on January 31st, according to a banner at the top of the service’s landing page. Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in a statement emailed to The Verge that the company is discontinuing the service because it only worked for a “limited number of items” and customers have been “increasingly using our new AI-powered features” to decide what to buy. Tagay gave examples like Virtual Try-On AR feature that puts 3D renders of shoes from certain brands on your feet using your smartphone’s camera. She also mentioned the company’s LLM-powered “personalized size recommendations” that tweak size recommendations based on customer reviews. Prime Try Before You Buy launched in 2018 for all Prime subscribers as Amazon Wardrobe before the company later changed its name. Through it, Prime members can order up to six items, try them for seven days, then pay for what works and send back the rest — like a very basic version of Stitch Fix’s curated clothing service. But a big part of that is returns, which is something the company has been trying to cut back on. The discontinuation of Prime Try Before You Buy comes after years of cost-cutting at the company, as CNBC points out. That’s included massive layoffs and shuttering physical stores, as well as scaling back some of its efforts in the grocery industry. Here is the full statement Tagay provided to The Verge: Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025. Of course, customers will continue to enjoy fast, free shipping, with easy, free returns on our full apparel selection. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.
