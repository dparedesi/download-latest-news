The first Game Changers award winner says "disturbing" comments about him and his family have followed his acceptance speech. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amir Satvat, the recipient of the first "Game Changers" award at this year's Game Awards, says he's received "countless hateful messages" as well as "disturbing comments" following his acceptance of the award last week, including antisemetic remarks about his wife. "I am continuing to do my best to tune this out but it is quite extreme," Satvat said in a LinkedIn post. During the event, Geoff Keighley admitted that he's "struggled" to know how best to address the unprecedented rash of games industry layoffs we've seen over the past few years. It was the first time the host and producer directly addressed layoffs at the awards, and the solution he came up with was to honor Satvat, a figure well-known in the games business for his efforts to help laid-off developers find new work. A brief video segment described how Satvat's project has helped "place nearly 3,000 people in jobs," and Satvat accepted the award with a tearful speech in which he challenged the crowd to make the industry better. Many viewers responded positively to the segment, including viewers in the industry, but some have criticized it as a cynical attempt to keep up the appearance of caring while celebrating the very people responsible for the poor state of the business—the executives in the audience whose companies ultimately fund The Game Awards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who oversaw Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the subsequent layoffs, is on the show's advisory board, for example. Some critics went well beyond denouncing the awards, however: After the ceremony, Satvat himself came under attack for his job at Tencent, where he's been a business development director for about a year and a half. The suggestion going around social media is that Satvat was presented as a kind of folk hero, but is actually part of the problem—or even a sinister "industry plant" whose heartwarming story was entirely manufactured. Satvat says that his job wasn't mentioned during the show because it's irrelevant. He began providing games industry job hunting resources before he started work at Tencent last year, and says that he doesn't deal with mergers there, didn't at his previous job at Amazon, and has never laid anyone off. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. "I've never signed a contract or personally been part of a deal that led to job losses in my career," wrote Satvat. "In fact, in some instances, like at [Amazon Web Services], I put great effort into making sure hundreds of peoples' jobs were saved during moments of restructuring. "I've also been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into,' usually by people who spent all of 8 seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across 5 different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know." I was aware of Satvat prior to the awards because, in the course of covering the industry's layoffs over the past couple years, his name has repeatedly come up in the aftermath of job cuts as the person out-of-work developers should seek out. I've understood him to be a well-liked figure whose efforts are genuinely appreciated by game developers who've lost their jobs over the past two years. That impression is reflected in the many positive comments posted about Satvat following his acceptance speech, such as in the replies to this post on BlueSky. "Amir got me a union job in Game Dev in 2024," reads one. "He deserves the world." The criticism, insults, and accusations Satvat is otherwise receiving don't appear to come from any one perspective—good faith criticism of The Game Awards is mixed in with shouting about China, antisemitism, and other staples of internet discourse most associated today with X. "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry—this is the 'reward' for two years of service," Satvat wrote. "...I did not want to say anything but there have been too many comments about my family, about my wife, about her religious background, and other things that are way over the line for me not to say anything." Satvat says that the post will be his last word on the negative comments, and that he will continue to pursue "positive, public service." Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League. In what will surely come as no surprise at all, the end of Suicide Squad means layoffs at Warner Bros. The Game Awards 2024 results: All the winners Fallout's Tim Cain spent 6 years working on defunct MMO WildStar, twice as long as any other game, and thinks that might have something to do with why it failed PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Atlassian Take the annual Work Life survey – your insights really help. Adapting to Change: How Key Trends in Data, AI, and Design-Led Innovation Will Shape the Future of Products Head of Design, Growth In today’s fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Globally, we are witnessing a profound transformation in how technology and design come together to address real human problems in powerful ways. As designers, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to shape this next decade of evolution—not just responding to change, but actively leaning into it. Two decades ago, product design was often an afterthought—a cosmetic touch-up to existing ideas. This was the “Lipstick-on-the-Pig” era when designers were brought in at the end to “make it pretty,” focusing solely on typography, color, and layout without considering the deeper problems. Design was disconnected from business/product strategy, and the most exciting work was typically found in agencies, leaving in-house design a distant second. Everything changed in 2007 with the iPhone. It wasn’t just another product; it was a seismic shift that redefined the importance of intuitive user experience and sophisticated design. Apple’s meticulous focus on the end-to-end journey—from unboxing to the seamless integration of hardware and software set a new benchmark. The App Store revolutionized how we accessed consumer products, establishing a new standard that required a structured approach with Apple’s human interface guidelines as the foundation for consistency. This era proved that good design is indeed good business, transforming the roles of designers, engineers, product managers, and marketers in ways we couldn’t have imagined. The iPhone didn’t just revolutionize mobile devices—it democratized access to information, opening the door for an entirely new generation of digital products. The 2010s were a transformative decade for design as we saw the rise of iconic platforms like Airbnb, Instagram, and Uber, which quickly became essential parts of our daily lives. These disruptors proved that innovative product experience, driven by user-centric thinking, could reshape entire industries. Meanwhile, companies that failed to adapt—like Blockbuster, Kodak, and Borders were left behind, overtaken by nimble upstarts like Netflix, Instagram, and Amazon – who leveraged technology and design to deliver superior experiences and enduring value. Another key milestone in the evolution of craft-focused, small-“d” “design” was the mainstream adoption of Design Thinking, championed by institutions like IDEO and Stanford’s d.school. This inclusive approach expanded the role of strategy-driven, capital-”D” “Design” beyond aesthetics, involving non-designers in crafting user experiences. Enterprise companies began to realize the transformative power of Design, reimagining their clunky enterprise software into consumer-grade experiences that became a competitive advantage. I was fortunate to be part of this movement at SAP, co-founding the AppHaus (a think-take innovation center) that transformed enterprise products. SAP, along with companies like IBM, Cisco, and Google, reimagined the design of enterprise products and elevated it from second-class citizen to a critical driver of business success. This decade was a remarkable period for Design innovation, with breakthroughs like responsive and mobile-first Design redefining user interaction across devices. The emergence of Design systems streamlined experiences, allowing for scalable, unified interfaces. And the rise of minimalism and flat Design made me, for one, particularly glad to bid farewell to skeuomorphic Design. Wearable technology began to integrate into our daily routines, and voice UI marked the beginning of hands-free, natural language interactions. While technology and engineering often steal the spotlight in discussions around these types of innovation, it’s essential to recognize that Design has been in the driver’s—or at least co-driver’s—seat in generating these disruptive transformations that have reset expectations for acceptable product experiences. As Designers, we’ve broadened and elevated our skillsets beyond our core design craft to encompass Systems Thinking, Design Thinking, User Research, Content Design and overlapping aspects of cross-functional collaboration (roadmapping, QA testing, etc.). As a result, we cemented our roles as integral partners alongside Engineering and Product teams. This shift established the expectation that Designers now influence and contribute throughout the entire product lifecycle. Fast forward to the 2020s, and it’s clear that Design has firmly established itself as a core competency in product development. We’ve reached a point where shipping a product without embedded Design would be unthinkable. The EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) triad is now industry standard, not because it’s a trend, but because we have tangible proof that it works. The real litmus test? Design literacy among roles like product managers, engineers, data scientists, and researchers has significantly increased, thanks to the collective effort we’ve made to demonstrate Design’s impact. In short, Product Design is here to stay. Looking back on the past two decades, I see incredible progress, but that doesn’t mean we can rest on our achievements. Like waves in the ocean, there’s always another one coming—a set of new challenges and opportunities that will require us to continue evolving and pushing the boundaries. Key trends shaping the future of Product Design are like waves—building momentum and power as they approach. We need to be ready to catch and ride them. Before diving in, let me offer a few disclaimers: this is not an exhaustive list, but these are the trends that stand out to me as being particularly impactful for the future of Design. I didn’t invent these ideas; many brilliant minds in tech are constantly looking around the corner, and I’ve synthesized a lot of that thinking here. These trends may seem obvious, but the value lies in how we position ourselves to harness their potential. The first trend shaping the future of Product Design is what I think of as The Data Tsunami in the age of affordable quantum computing. This isn’t just a wave—it’s a tidal force, with data being generated at unprecedented levels from every interaction, both active and passive, across all aspects of life. As quantum computing becomes more accessible, the instrumentation of everything we touch becomes the norm, flooding us with deep, complex data. The challenge for us as designers is to navigate this flood of information with intentionality. It’s no longer about simply collecting data; we must blend analytical understanding with creative intuition, ensuring our decisions are data-informed rather than blindly data-driven. As Adam Grant recently said, “The hallmark of expertise is no longer how much you know. It’s how well you synthesize.” In an age of information overload, the ability to recognize patterns and connect the dots is far more critical than just accumulating facts. The future of design will demand this deeper understanding—knowing how to ask the right questions, combine qualitative insights with quantitative data, and refine our instincts to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape. The next wave shaping product Design is The AI Effect. This one is no rogue wave; we’ve seen it building with increasing force. And it’s here for good. AI, combined with the explosion of data, is unlocking groundbreaking creative possibilities that were unimaginable just a few years ago. AI-driven tools are also revolutionizing productivity by cutting production time from months to minutes, significantly accelerating workflows and transforming how knowledge workers manage day-to-day tasks. The impact on productivity is unprecedented. AI is also democratizing product creation—people without Design or engineering backgrounds are now able to build 0-to-1 products with ease. This will necessitate as designers to be better taste makers by differentiate through experience, brand, and storytelling. But here’s the key: AI is just another tool—one that enhances, rather than replaces, our creative capabilities. As designers, we MUST embrace AI for the acceleration it offers, using it to craft the next generation of products that stand out in a crowded marketplace. How do you get started? Though it may seem daunting, it’s actually quite simple: Go play! There’s a tool for every interest! Dive into an AI powered tool in a space that you are passionate about, and explore how capabilities are evolving. Start crafting experiences whether at work or for your personal creativity. By embracing these tools and integrating them into your toolkit and your daily workflow, you’ll unlock productivity and new ways to innovate and push the boundaries of design. The next trend builds on the power of data and AI: The Interconnectedness of Products. As tools continue to proliferate, there will be a growing need for a layer that makes sense of and connects these products—a layer of true interconnectedness. This is where AI assistants or agents come in, seamlessly integrating and managing information across all the products we interact with, creating a unified experience for our personal, professional, and family lives. These AI-driven systems are set to become indispensable, enhancing productivity and embedding themselves into our everyday routines in ways that once seemed like science fiction. However, this shift also brings challenges: privacy concerns, ethical dilemmas, and the risk of over-reliance on AI could impact our cognitive abilities and social dynamics, manifesting as critical user experience problems to be solved. Despite these challenges, the adoption of AI assistants is a trend that cannot be overlooked. The global market for AI assistants is projected to reach $71.42 billion by 2031, growing at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.18%​. This growth underscores the urgency for designers and technologists to harness AI’s potential while addressing its complexities, shaping it into a tool that empowers rather than overwhelms. In today’s fast-paced world, design is no longer just about aesthetics—it’s the driving force behind innovation and survival. Countless technological trends are set to shape the future of product design, each redefining user experiences. Immersive technologies like AR/VR and mixed reality will transform how we engage with digital spaces. Universal digital currencies will enable seamless, borderless transactions, while advancements like 3D bioprinting and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will revolutionize healthcare, shifting the focus from treating illness to enhancing wellness. Smart city solutions and green technology integration are set to improve urban living and drive sustainability. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. At the core of next generation innovations lies one crucial factor – the user experience solving real human problems or opportunities that will ultimately determine the adoption and impact of these technologies. The reality we must face is that tech layoffs and the displacement of some roles by AI are indeed happening. But even as we navigate these challenges, we can’t lose sight of the opportunities ahead. For designers, Creativity remains our most valuable asset. This moment presents an incredible chance to play to our strengths to craft the next generation of experiences. One of the most exciting trends shaping the future of product Design is The Designpreneur Boom—a wave of designers redefining entrepreneurship by founding successful startups. We’ve already seen industry giants like Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia (Airbnb), Evan Sharp (Pinterest) and Char Hurley (co-founder of Youtube) demonstrate the incredible potential of Design-led companies. These founders didn’t just focus on design craft; they broadened their skills to include marketing, engineering, research, and business acumen. Some of these designpreneurs co-founded with others who had these important complementary skills. Take Dylan Field, for example. He gathered hands-on knowledge across disciplines (product design, engineering, marketing, data analytics, research etc.) that gave him a powerful holistic understanding and toolkit to build Figma into a billion-dollar company. This is super inspiring! This trend highlights a key takeaway—designers who expand their skill sets beyond traditional craft are uniquely positioned for entrepreneurial success. If we want to see more Design-founded startups, our educational institutions need to evolve, integrating interdisciplinary learning that includes technology, business, and leadership training. But don’t wait for formal education to catch up—self-education and hands-on experiences are just as critical. As the future unfolds, I hope we’ll see even more designpreneurs shaping the next generation of innovation. Let’s turn mockups into unicorns. The future of product design is filled with both exciting opportunities and inevitable challenges. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, it’s clear that some jobs will be replaced or redefined. As designers, we can approach these changes from an empowered place. Instead of fearing the shifts, we can embrace them knowing that we have exciting possibilities to influence and drive the next generation of product experience. The need for thoughtful, impactful design will only grow, and those of us willing to adapt will be at the forefront of this transformation. Siva Sabaretnam Head of Design, Growth Embrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections – and have fun along the way. Navigating and celebrating the complexities of our individuality. How you work is just as important as the work you're doing. By Atlassian Culture, tech, teams, and tips, delivered twice a month

Title: Move Over 'Rage Applying' And 'Quiet Quitting,' 2025 Will Be The Year Of 'Revenge Quitting'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Over the past few years, people’s feelings about their jobs have changed dramatically. Initially, there was “rage applying,” where employees who were angry about their jobs applied for dozens of other jobs. Then there was “quiet quitting,” in which people chose to work as little as possible while still staying employed and probably applying for other positions. As 2025 approaches, a new trend emerges: “revenge quitting.” Revenge quitting is all about leaving loudly, deliberately and with purpose instead of quietly disengaging or passively browsing job listings. People are quitting loudly because they're fed up with feeling undervalued, overworked and stuck in unhealthy workplaces. Don't Miss: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. “The job market is starting to loosen up and for those who have been simmering with frustration, this might be the year they finally quit – not just quietly but loudly,” Edel Holliday-Quinn, a business psychologist, told Business Insider. For many, the seeds of this trend were planted during the chaotic shifts of the pandemic. Employees felt overworked and alienated due to layoffs, increased workloads and ongoing back-and-forth arguments on hybrid work arrangements. Toxic workplaces, which are still too prevalent, added to these annoyances. In fact, according to a Businessolver survey, 52% of CEOs and 42% of employees said their workplace culture was toxic. For many, the frustration is no longer bearable. Amazon's recent return-to-office mandate is a prime example of how these frustrations are coming to a head. CEO Andy Jassy's decision to require employees to work in the office full-time starting in 2025 has caused an uproar. See Also: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? According to a Blind survey, 73% of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers are thinking about leaving because of the policy and 80% of them claim they know coworkers who feel the same. Although Amazon defends the action to encourage creativity and teamwork, many employees view it as a strict and tone-deaf decision that disregards the reality of the current workplace and are prepared to leave. Younger workers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, are also playing a big role in revenge quitting. They're less willing to put up with old-fashioned rules or work environments that clash with their values. A poll by Indeed showed that nearly 40% of younger workers might quit their jobs over political disagreements with their bosses. The intense political climate amplifies these tensions, especially during election cycles, leaving employees feeling disrespected and alienated in workplaces where they're expected to coexist with opposing views. For them, walking away is less about a paycheck and more about integrity.

Join 30,000+ shareholders and invest at $0.26/share today. Even industries like cryptocurrency, which once seemed exciting, are seeing people lose interest. Travis Kling, Chief Investment Officer at Ikigai Asset Management, discussed a “quiet quitting” trend in crypto. Many workers in the industry feel let down by broken promises and poor leadership. When industries don't live up to their hype, workers feel betrayed and leave – sometimes dramatically. Revenge quitting shows how the balance of power between workers and employers is shifting. Workers aren't just putting up with bad jobs anymore; they're rejecting them loudly. As Holliday-Quinn explained, “Dissatisfaction has been quietly brewing. The disconnect between leadership and the workforce isn't just a communication issue – it's a retention crisis waiting to happen.” Businesses should take note of this trend. If they don’t adjust, they risk losing their finest employees. They need to create healthier workplace cultures, provide flexibility and demonstrate empathy to maintain their teams’ satisfaction. Employees are more inclined to stay or at least depart amicably when they feel valued, which improves the transition. Read Next: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Every year has its share of PR disasters, headline-grabbing hacks, and puzzling product launches. In 2024, we saw a chip giant struggle for relevance, an AI exec get in over his head, and a faulty software update brick millions of PCs. And let's not forget Elon's antics. Here are some of the top fails from the year and a few honorable mentions for notable 2024 facepalms. This will go down as Intel’s worst year in recent memory. The board booted out CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was once hailed as Intel’s savior. The chip maker was also forced to lay off 15,000 employees. And it’s struggled to respond to demand for AI GPUs, a market Nvidia has been dominating. On top of all this, Intel’s reputation for PC desktop chips took a serious hit after admitting that its “Raptor Lake” processors suffered from a voltage bug capable of damaging the silicon. Although Intel pledged to replace the affected processors, many PC builders flocked to rival AMD and its Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming processor. Here’s hoping Team Blue makes a comeback in 2025; the industry could use more competition in PC chips and graphics cards.—Michael Kan It looks like China has the power to spy on your phone calls, texts, and possibly more. A Chinese-linked hacking group known as “Salt Typhoon” breached at least eight US telecommunications companies in a campaign that’s potentially been going on for two years, according to White House officials. What makes the hack especially disturbing is that Salt Typhoon hackers likely remain in US networks as federal investigators try to uncover the full scope of the scheme. The only good news is that Salt Typhoon is focused on high-profile politicians, including Donald Trump, rather than average Americans. But it could take months or even years for the US to sort out the extent of the hack, and to shore up the country’s telecom networks. —Michael Kan It was never a good idea to allow any company to buy and sell people’s personal data. Unfortunately, the woeful state of data privacy in the US was on full display in 2024 when a little-known background check company called National Public Data lost as many as 272 million Social Security numbers to a hacker. The stolen database, which also included full names, addresses, and dates of birth, was leaked on a hacking forum this summer, giving scammers a valuable trove of data to exploit for identity theft schemes and other kinds of fraud. The company behind National Public Data has since shut down and is facing investigations and class-action lawsuits from across the country. But the damage is done. Millions of Americans now have another reason to worry about their privacy.—Michael Kan In July, we learned just how reliant the world is on a handful of companies in the tech space when cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a faulty kernel-level update. It crashed 8.5 million Windows PCs, which displayed the “blue screen of death” and unleashed global chaos. Over 2,700 flights were cancelled, US border checkpoints had to temporarily ditch their digital systems, FedEx and UPS packages were delayed, Social Security offices and DMVs came to a standstill, and healthcare facilities switched to manual operations. It also delayed some transit systems, caused brief 9-1-1 outages, and took down some payment systems. Delta Air Lines and CrowdStrike shareholders have since sued CrowdStrike over the faulty update. And Microsoft is prepping a Windows “Quick Machine Recovery” mode that will let IT administrators remotely fix a Windows machine even if it's unable to boot.—Kate Irwin At its Build developer conference this spring, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered “Recall” feature for Windows PCs that takes snapshots of your activity so you can easily return to it at a later date. But it prompted concern that Recall could be compromised to expose user data or record passwords and financial data. Microsoft clarified that Recall is stored locally, but it still delayed the launch, beefed up Recall’s settings options, and made the feature opt-in by default for business users. In late November, Microsoft finally launched the feature for Windows 11 Insiders only, to gather feedback and potentially make more tweaks. But failing to address those security concerns upfront was an embarrassing black eye for Redmond.—Kate Irwin The archival Internet Archive platform experienced a DDoS attack in October that may have exposed 31 million users and took down the site for days. And the site didn’t restore full functionality right away when it came back online. A hacker who claimed responsibility for the attack said he did it because the US supports Israel and the Internet Archive is a US site. The hacker also called the US government “horrendous and hypocritical” in a statement. Thankfully, the Internet Archive’s operator, Brewster Kahle, has said that “the data is safe,” but the fact that the DDoS attack took the entire platform offline was an ominous fail that did little to calm concerns about our ability to preserve internet history.—Kate Irwin For a brief moment amid this year’s AI hype, a few startups imagined a new way to use it, and quickly crashed and burned. Rabbit and Humane both developed hardware with an AI-powered voice assistant inside. The idea? Free us from staring at cell phone screens by offering a more intuitive, always-available way to interact with the tech. The devices immediately garnered negative reviews. We gave the Rabbit R1 a 2/5 rating, finding that it couldn’t compete with or replace the widely available smart assistants that are already in our pockets. The Humane AI Pin, meanwhile, was slow to respond in our hands on at MWC, and the company was reportedly looking for a buyer shortly after launch. Apple may have a better shot with its revamped version of Siri, coming in 2026.—Emily Forlini EV owners were blindsided when one of the most popular home charger companies suddenly pulled the plug on its US business in October. EU-based JuiceBox posted a message to its website that basically said: “Sorry, but the hardware installed in your garage will no longer be supported in a few weeks. It’ll still charge the vehicle, but forget about any mobile app monitoring or over-the-air updates. And that public JuiceBox charger in your local grocery store parking lot? That’s just not going to work at all.” After some serious backlash, JuiceBox parent company EnelX signed a deal to prolong software support, but the ordeal underscores how you never truly own a software-defined piece of hardware.—Emily Forlini We don’t typically write about celebrities, but then Sam Altman ticked off Scarlett Johansson. The OpenAI CEO marketed the company’s Voice Mode feature as a real-life version of the 2013 movie Her, in which Johansson plays the voice of an AI named Samantha. But after a May demo of the tech featured a voice that sounded a lot like Johansson, the actress claimed that she declined Altman’s request to train the model on her voice. OpenAI denied using Johansson’s voice; it said it hired a separate voice actor for the role of "Sky." Still, the company disabled that voice option, and Sky was not one of the voice options when Advanced Voice Mode rolled out this fall.—Emily Forlini Days after he announced plans to acquire Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk argued that the platform needed to be “politically neutral” in order for it to “deserve public trust.” This approach, he said, “effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.” In March 2024, he also pledged to not donate to either US presidential candidate, but by July, he’d changed his tune dramatically, swapping neutrality for MAGA hats. “If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win,” Musk tweeted in September. He seized the @America X handle to promote Trump, donated millions to his campaign, shared doctored and misleading clips of VP Kamala Harris, and is now working closely with the president-elect on an effort to cut government spending, which is most certainly a conflict of interest given his government contracts. The shift sent many X users to alternatives like Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon in the days after the US election.—Chloe Albanesius Check out our masthead to see who we are, and what we do.

Title: Never Forgive Them
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last year, I’ve spent about 200,000 words on a kind of personal journey where I’ve tried again and again to work out why everything digital feels so broken, and why it seems to keep getting worse, despite what tech’s “brightest” minds might promise. More regularly than not, I’ve found that the answer is fairly simple: the tech industry’s incentives no longer align with the user. The people running the majority of internet services have used a combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I’m stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from customers, but also by the insidious way they’ve gradually degraded their products. To be clear, I don’t believe that this gradual enshittification is part of some grand, Machiavellian long game by the tech companies, but rather the product of multiple consecutive decisions made in response to short-term financial needs. Even if it was, the result would be the same — people wouldn’t notice how bad things have gotten until it’s too late, or they might just assume that tech has always sucked, or they’re just personally incapable of using the tools that are increasingly fundamental to living in a modern world. You are the victim of a con — one so pernicious that you’ve likely tuned it out despite the fact it’s part of almost every part of your life. It hurts everybody you know in different ways, and it hurts people more based on their socioeconomic status. It pokes and prods and twists millions of little parts of your life, and it’s everywhere, so you have to ignore it, because complaining about it feels futile, like complaining about the weather. It isn’t. You’re battered by the Rot Economy, and a tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value. A death cult has taken over the markets, using software as a mechanism to extract value at scale in the pursuit of growth at the cost of user happiness. These people want everything from you — to control every moment you spend working with them so that you may provide them with more ways to make money, even if doing so doesn’t involve you getting anything else in return. Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and a majority of tech platforms are at war with the user, and, in the absence of any kind of consistent standards or effective regulations, the entire tech ecosystem has followed suit. A kind of Coalition of the Willing of the worst players in hyper-growth tech capitalism. Things are being made linearly worse in the pursuit of growth in every aspect of our digital lives, and it’s because everything must grow, at all costs, at all times, unrelentingly, even if it makes the technology we use every day consistently harmful. This year has, on some level, radicalized me, and today I’m going to explain why. It’s going to be a long one, because I need you to fully grasp the seriousness and widespread nature of the problem. You have, more than likely, said to yourself sometime in the last ten years that you “didn’t get tech,” or that you are “getting too old,” or that tech has “gotten away from you” because you found a service, or an app, or a device annoying. You, or someone you love, have convinced yourself that your inability to use something is a sign that you’re deficient, that you’ve failed to “keep up with the times,” as if the things we use every day should be in a constant state of flux. The tools we use in our daily lives outside of our devices have mostly stayed the same. While buttons on our cars might have moved around — and I’m not even getting into Tesla’s designs right now — we generally have a brake, an accelerator, a wheel, and a turn signal. Boarding an airplane has worked mostly the same way since I started flying, other than moving from physical tickets to digital ones. We’re not expected to work out “the new way to use a toilet” every few months because somebody decided we were finishing too quickly. Yet our apps and the platforms we use every day operate by a totally different moral and intellectual compass. While the idea of an update is fairly noble (and not always negative) — that something you’ve bought can be maintained and improved over time is a good thing — many tech platforms see it as a means to further extract and exploit, to push users into doing things that either keep them on the app longer or take more-profitable actions. We as a society need to reckon with how this twists us up, makes us more paranoid, more judgmental, more aggressive, more reactionary, because when everything is subtly annoying, we all simmer and suffer in manifold ways. There is no digital world and physical world — they are, and have been, the same for quite some time, and reporting on tech as if this isn’t the case fails the user. It may seem a little dramatic, but take a second and really think about how many little digital irritations you deal with in a day. It’s time to wake up to the fact that our digital lives are rotten. I’m not talking about one single product or company, but most digital experiences. The interference is everywhere, and we’ve all learned to accept conditions that are, when written out plainly, are kind of insane. Back in 2023, Spotify redesigned its app to, and I quote The Verge, be “part TikTok, part Instagram, and part YouTube,” which in practice meant replacing a relatively clean and straightforward user interface with one made up of full-screen cards (like TikTok) and autoplaying video podcasts (like TikTok), which CEO Daniel Ek claimed would, to quote Sky News, make the platform “come alive” with different content on a platform built and sold as a place to listen to music. The tech media waved off the redesign without really considering the significance of the fact that at the drop of a hat, hundreds of millions of people’s experience of listening to music would change based on the whims of a multi-billionaire, with the express purpose being to force these people to engage with completely different content as a means of increasing engagement metrics and revenue. By all means try and pretend this is “just an app,” but people’s relationships with music and entertainment are deeply important to their moods and motivations, and adding layers of frustration in an app they interact with for hours a day is consistently grating. And no matter how you feel, this design was never for the customer. Nobody using Spotify was saying “ah man, I wish I could watch videos on this,” but that doesn’t matter because engagement and revenue must increase. It’s clear that Spotify, a company best-known for exploiting the artists on its platform, treats its customers (both paying and otherwise) with a similar level of contempt. It’s far from alone. Earlier in the year, smart speaker company Sonos released a redesign of its app that removed accessibility features and the ability to edit song queues or play music from your phone in an attempt to “modernize” the interface, with WIRED suggesting that the changes could potentially open the door to adding a subscription of some sort to help Sonos’ ailing growth. Meta’s continual redesigns of Facebook and Instagram — the latest of which happened in October to “focus on Gen Z” — are probably the most egregious example of the constant chaos of our digital lives. As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. Every experience demands our email address, and giving out our email address adds another email to inboxes already stuffed with two types of spam — the actual “get the biggest laser” spam that hits the junk folder automatically, and the marketing emails we receive from clothing brands we wanted a discount from or newspapers we pay for that still feel it’s necessary to bother us 3 to 5 times a day. I’ve basically given up trying to fight back — how about you? Every app we use is intentionally built to “growth hack” — a term that means “moving things around in such a way that a user does things that we want them to do” so they spend more money or time on the platform — which is why dating apps gate your best matches behind $1.99 microtransactions, or why Uber puts “suggestions” and massive banners throughout their apps to try and convince you to use one of its other apps (or accidentally hit them, which gives Uber a chance to get you to try them), or why Outlook puts advertisements in your email inbox that are near-indistinguishable from new emails (they’re at the top of your inbox too), or why Meta’s video carousels intentionally only play the first few seconds of a clip as a means of making you click. Our digital lives are actively abusive and hostile, riddled with subtle and overt cons. Our apps are ever-changing, adapting not to our needs or conditions, but to the demands of investors and internal stakeholders that have reduced who we are and what we do to an ever-growing selection of manipulatable metrics. It isn’t that you don’t “get” tech, it’s that the tech you use every day is no longer built for you, and as a result feels a very specific kind of insane. Every app has a different design, almost every design is optimized based on your activity on said app, with each app trying to make you do different things in uniquely annoying ways. Meta has hundreds of people on its growth team perpetuating a culture that manipulates and tortures users to make company metrics improve, like limiting the amount of information in a notification to make a user browse deeper into the site, and deliberately promoting low-quality clickbait that promises “one amazing trick” because people click those links, even if they suck. It’s everywhere. After a coup by head of ads Prabhakar Raghavan in 2019, Google intentionally made search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times that people would search for something on the site. Ever wonder why your workplace uses Sharepoint and other horrible Microsoft apps? That’s because Microsoft’s massive software monopoly meant that it was cheaper for your boss to buy all of it in one place, and thus its incentive is to make it good enough to convince your boss to sign up for all of their stuff rather than an app that makes your life easier or better. Why does every website feel different, and why do some crash randomly or make your phone burn your hand? It’s because every publisher has pumped their sites full of as much ad tracking software as possible as a means of monetizing every single user in as many ways as possible, helping ads follow you across the entire internet. And why does everybody need your email? Because your inbox is one of the few places that advertisers haven’t found a consistent way to penetrate. It’s digital tinnitus. It’s the pop-up from a shopping app that you downloaded to make one purchase, or the deceptive notification from Instagram that you have “new views” that doesn’t actually lead anywhere. It is the autoplaying video advertisement on your film review website. It is the repeated request for you to log back into a newspaper website that you logged into yesterday because everyone must pay and nothing must get through. It is the hundredth Black Friday sale you got from a company that you swear you unsubscribed from eight times, and perhaps even did, but there’s no real way to keep track. It’s the third time this year you’ve had to make a new password because another data breach happened and the company didn’t bother to encrypt it. I’m not writing this to complain, but because I believe — as I hinted at a few weeks ago — that we are in the midst of the largest-scale ecological disaster of our time, because almost every single interaction with technology, which is required to live in modern society, has become actively adversarial to the user. These issues hit everything we do, all the time, a constant onslaught of interference, and I believe it’s so much bigger than just social media and algorithms — though they’re a big part of it, of course. In plain terms, everybody is being fucked with constantly in tiny little ways by most apps and services, and I believe that billions of people being fucked with at once in all of these ways has profound psychological and social consequences that we’re not meaningfully discussing. The average person’s experience with technology is one so aggressive and violative that I believe it leaves billions of people with a consistent low-grade trauma. We seem, as a society, capable of understanding that social media can hurt us, unsettle us, or make us feel crazed and angry, but I think it’s time to accept that the rest of the tech ecosystem undermines our wellbeing in an equally-insidious way. And most people don’t know it’s happening, because everybody has accepted deeply shitty conditions for the last ten years. Now, some of you may scoff at this a little — after all, you’re smart, you know about disinformation, you know about the tricks of these companies, and thus most people do, right? Wrong! Most people don’t think about the things they’re doing at all and are just trying to get by in a society that increasingly demands we make more money to buy the same things, with our lives both interfered with and judged by social networks with aggressive algorithms that feed us more things based on what we’ll engage with, which might mean said things piss us off or actively radicalize us. They’re nagged by constant notifications — an average of 46 a day — some useful, some advertisements, like Apple telling us there’s a nailbiter college football game regardless of whether we’ve ever interacted with anything football related, or a Slack message saying you haven’t joined a group you were invited to yet, or Etsy letting you know that you can buy things for an upcoming holiday. It’s relentless, and the more time you invest in using a device, the more of these notifications you get, making you less likely to turn them off. After all, how well are you doing keeping your inbox clean? Oh what’s that? You get 25 emails a day, many of them from a company owned by William Sonoma? Your work software veers between “shit” and “just okay,” and never really seems to get better, nor does any part seem to smoothly connect to another. Your organization juggles anywhere from five to fifteen different pieces of software — Slack or Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom for communication, Asana or Monday or Basecamp for project management, or Jira, or Trello, or any number of other different ways that your organization or team wants to plan things. When you connect with another organization, you find they’re using a different product, or perhaps they’re using the same one — say, Slack — and that one requires you to join their organization, which may or may not work. I’m not even talking about the innumerable amount of tech infrastructure products that more-technical workers have to deal with, or how much worse this gets if you’ve got a slower device. Every organization does things differently, and some don’t put a lot of thought into how they do so. Yet beyond the endless digital nags there’s the need to be constantly aware of scams and outright misinformation, both on social networks that don’t really care to stop it and on the chum box advertisements below major news publications — you know, the little weird stories at the bottom promising miracle cures. It’s easy to assume that it’s natural that you’d know there are entities out there trying to scam you or trick you, and I’d argue most people don’t. To most, a video from Rumble.com may as well be the same thing as a video from CNN.com, and most people would believe that every advertisement on every website is somehow verified for its accuracy, versus “sold at scale all the time to whoever will pay the money.” And when I say that, I’m really talking about CNN.com, a website that had 594 million visitors in October 2024. At the bottom is the “Paid Partner Content” section, including things from publications ‘like “FinanceBuzz” that tell you about the “9 Dumbest Things Smart People Waste Money On.” FinanceBuzz immediately asks for you to turn your notifications on — you know, so it can ping you when it has new articles — and each bullet point leads to one of its affiliate marketing arms trying to sell you car insurance and credit cards. You’re offered the chance to share your email address to receive “vetted side hustles and proven ways to earn extra cash sent to your inbox,” which I assume includes things like advertorial content telling you that yes, you could make money playing online bingo (such as “Bingo Cash”) against other people. Papaya Games, developer of Bingo Cash, was sued in March by rival gaming company Skillz for using bots in allegedly skill-based games that are supposed to be between humans, and the Michigan Gaming Control Board issued a cease-and-desist order against the company for violating multiple gaming laws, including the Lawful Internet Gaming Act. To quote the lawsuit, “Papaya’s games are not skill-based and users are often not playing against live, actual opponents but against Papaya’s own bots that direct and rig the game so that Papaya itself wins its users’ money while leading them to believe that they lost to a live human opponent.” This is a website and its associated content that has prime placement on the front page of a major news outlet. As a normal person, it’s reasonable to believe that CNN would not willfully allow advertisements for websites that are, in and of themselves, further advertisements masquerading as trustworthy third party entities. It’s reasonable that you would believe that FinanceBuzz was a reputable website, and that its intentions were to share great deals and secret tricks with you. If you think you’re not this stupid, you are privileged and need to have more solidarity with your fellow human beings. Why wouldn’t you think that the content on one of the most notable media outlets in the entire world is trustworthy? Why wouldn’t you trust that CNN, a respected media outlet, had vetted its advertisers and made sure their content wasn’t actively tricking its users? I think it’s fair to say that CNN has likely led to thousands of people being duped by questionable affiliate marketing companies, and likely profited from doing so. Why wouldn’t people feel insane? Why wouldn’t the internet, where we’re mostly forced to live, drive most people crazy? How are we not discussing the fact that so much of the internet is riddled with poison? How are we not treating the current state of the tech industry like an industrial chemical accident? Is it because there are too many people at fault? Is it because fixing it would require us to truly interrogate the fabric of a capitalist death cult? Nothing I am writing is polemic or pessimistic or describing anything other than the shit that’s happening in front of my eyes and your eyes and the eyes of billions of people. Dismissing these things as “just how it is” allows powerful people with no real plan and no real goals other than growth to thrive, and sneering at people “dumb enough” to get tricked by an internet and tech industry built specifically to trick them suggests you have no idea how you are being scammed, because you’re smug and arrogant. I need you to stop trying to explain away how fucking offensive using the internet and technology has become. I need you to stop making excuses for the powerful and consider the sheer scale of the societal ratfucking happening on almost every single device in the world, and consider the ramifications of the difficulty that a human being using the internet has trying to live an honest, dignified and reasonable life. To exist in modern society requires you to use these devices, or otherwise sacrifice large parts of how you’d interact with other people. You need a laptop or a smartphone for work, for school, for anything really. You need messaging apps otherwise you don’t exist. As a result, there is a societal monopoly of sorts — or perhaps it’s more of a cartel, in the sense that, for the most part, every tech company has accepted these extremely aggressive, anti-user positions, all in pursuit of growth. The stakes are so much higher than anyone — especially the tech media — is willing to discuss. The extent of the damage, the pain, the frustration, the terror is so constant that we are all on some level numb to its effects, because discussing it requires accepting that the vast majority of people live poisoned digital lives. We all live in the ruins created by the Rot Economy, where the only thing that matters is growth. Growth of revenue, growth of the business, growth of metrics related to the business, growth of engagement, of clicks, of time on app, of purchases of micro-transactions, of impressions of ads, of things done that make executives feel happy. I’ll give you a more direct example. On November 21, I purchased the bestselling laptop from Amazon — a $238 Acer Aspire 1 with a four-year-old Celeron N4500 Processor, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 128GB of slow eMMC storage (which is, and I’m simplifying here, though not by much, basically an SD card soldered to the computer’s motherboard). Affordable and under-powered, I’d consider this a fairly representative sample of how millions of people interact with the internet. I believe it’s also a powerful illustration of the damage caused by the Rot Economy, and the abusive, exploitative way in which the tech industry treats people at scale. It took 1 minute and 50 seconds from hitting the power button for the laptop to get to the setup screen. It took another minute and a half to connect and begin downloading updates, which took several more minutes. After that, I was faced with a licensing agreement where I agreed to binding arbitration to use Windows, a 24 second pause, and then got shown a screen of different “ways I could unlock my Microsoft experience,” with animations that shuddered and jerked violently. Throughout, the laptop’s cheap trackpad would miss every few clicks. At this point, I was forced to create a Microsoft account and to hand over my cellphone number — or another email address — to receive a code, or I wouldn’t be able to use the laptop. Each menu screen takes 3-5 seconds to load, and I’m asked to “customize my experience” with things like “personalized ads, tips and recommendations,” with every option turned on by default, then to sign up for another account, this time with Acer. At one point I am simply shown an ad for Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage product with a QR code to download it on my phone, and then I’m told that Windows has to download a few updates, which I assume are different to the last time it did that. It has taken, at this point, around 20 minutes to get to this screen. It takes another 33 minutes for the updates to finish, and then another minute and 57 seconds to log in, at which point it pops up with a screen telling me to “set up my browser and discover the best of Windows,” including “finding the apps I love from the Microsoft Store” and the option to “create an AI-generated theme for your browser.” The laptop constantly struggles as I scroll through pages, the screen juddering, apps taking several seconds to load. When I opened the start bar — ostensibly a place where you have apps you’d use — I saw some things that felt familiar, like Outlook, an email client that is not actually installed and requires you to download it, and an option for travel website Booking.com, along with a link to LinkedIn. One app, ClipChamp, was installed but immediately needed to be updated, which did not work when I hit “update,” forcing me to go to find the updates page, which showed me at least 40 different apps called things like “SweetLabs Inc.” I have no idea what any of this stuff is. I type “sweetlabs” into the search bar, and it jankily interrupts into a menu that takes up a third of the screen, with half of that dedicated to “Mark Twain’s birthday,” two Mark Twain-related links, a “quiz of the day,” and four different games available for download. The computer pauses slightly every time I type a letter. Every animation shudders. Even moving windows around feels painful. It is clunky, slow, it feels cheap, and the operating system — previously something I’d considered to be “the thing that operates the computer system” — is actively rotten, strewn with ads, sponsored content, suggested apps, and intrusive design choices that make the system slower and actively upset the user. The reason I’m explaining this in such agonizing detail is that this experience is more indicative of the average person’s experience using a computer than anybody realizes. Though it’s tough to gauge how many of these things sold to make it a bestseller on Amazon, laptops in this pricepoint, with this specific version of Windows (Windows 11 Home in “S Mode” as discussed above), happen to dominate Amazon’s bestsellers along with Apple’s significantly-more-expensive MacBook Air and Pro series. It is reasonable to believe that a large amount of the laptops sold in America match this price point and spec — there are two similar ones on Best Buy’s bestsellers, and as of writing this sentence, multiple different laptops of this spec are on the front of Target’s laptop page. And if I haven’t made it completely clear, this means that millions of people are likely using a laptop that’s burdensomely slow, and full of targeted advertisements and content baked into the operating system in a way that’s either impossible or difficult to remove. For millions of people — and it really could be tens of millions considering the ubiquity of these laptops in eCommerce stores alone — the experience of using the computer is both actively exploitative and incredibly slow. Even loading up MSN.com — the very first page you see when you open a web browser — immediately hits you with ads for eBay, QVC and QuickBooks, with icons that sometimes simply don’t load. Every part of the operating system seems to be hounding you to use some sort of Microsoft product or some sort of product that Microsoft or the laptop manufacturer has been paid to make you see. While one can hope that the people buying these laptops have any awareness of anything, the reality is that they’re being dumped into a kind of TJ Maxx version of computing, except TJ Maxx clothes don’t sometimes scream at you to download TJ Maxx Plus or stop functioning because you used them too fast. Again, this is how most people are experiencing modern computing, and it isn’t because this is big business — it’s because laptop sales have been falling for over a decade, and manufacturers (and Microsoft) need as many ways to grow revenue as possible, even if the choices they make are actively harmful to consumers. At that point, said person using this laptop can now log onto the internet, and begin using websites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, all of which have algorithms we don’t really understand, but that have been regularly proven to be actively — and deliberately — manipulative and harmful. Now, I know reading about “algorithms” and “manipulation” makes some people’s eyes glaze over, but I want you to take a simpler approach for a second. I hypothesize that most people do not really think about how they interact with stuff — they load up YouTube, they type something in, they watch it, and maybe they click whatever is recommended next. They may know there’s an algorithm of sorts, but they’re not really sitting there thinking “okay so they want me to see this,” or they may even be grateful that the algorithm gave them something they like, and reinforce the algorithm with their own biases, some of which they might have gotten from the algorithm. To be clear, none of this is mind control or hypnosis or voodoo. These algorithms and their associated entities are not sitting there with some vast agenda to execute — the algorithms are built to keep you on the website, even if it upsets you, pisses you off, or misinforms you. Their incentive isn’t really to make you make any one choice, other than one that involves you staying on their platform or interacting with an advertisement for somebody else’s, and the heavy flow of political — and particularly conservative — content is a result of platforms knowing that’s what keeps people doing stuff on the platform. The algorithms are constantly adapting in real time to try and find something that you might spend time on, with little regard for whether that content is good, let alone good for you. Putting aside any moral responsibility, the experiences on these apps are discordant. Facebook, as I’ve written about in detail, is a complete nightmare — thousands of people being actively conned in supposed “help groups,” millions of people being scammed every day (with one man killing himself as a result of organized crime’s presence on Facebook), and bizarre AI slop is dominating feeds with Mark Zuckerberg promising that there’s more to come. That’s without mentioning a product experience that continually interrupts you with sponsored and suggested content, as these platforms always do, all algorithmically curated to keep you scrolling, while also hiding content from the people you care about, because Facebook thinks it won’t keep you on the platform for as long. The picture I am trying to paint is one of terror and abuse. The average person’s experience of using a computer starts with aggressive interference delivered in a shoddy, sludge-like frame, and as the wider internet opens up to said user, already battered by a horrible user experience, they’re immediately thrown into heavily-algorithmic feeds each built to con them, feeding whatever holds their attention and chucking ads in as best they can. As they browse the web, websites like NBCnews.com feature stories from companies like “WorldTrending.com” with advertisements for bizarre toys written in the style of a blog, so intentional in their deceit that the page in question has a huge disclaimer at the bottom saying it’s an ad. As their clunky, shuddering laptop hitches between every scroll, they go to ESPN.com, and the laptop slows to a crawl. Everything slows to a crawl. “God damnit, why is everything so fucking slow? I’ll just stay on Facebook or Instagram or YouTube. At least that place doesn’t crash half the time or trick me.” Using the computer in the modern age is so inherently hostile that it pushes us towards corporate authoritarians like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Meta — and now that every single website is so desperate for our email and to show us as many ads as possible, it’s either harmful or difficult for the average person to exist online. The biggest trick that these platforms played wasn’t any one algorithm, but the convenience of a “clean” digital experience — or, at least as clean as they feel it needs to be. In an internet so horribly poisoned by growth capitalism, these platforms show a degree of peace and consistency, even if they’re engineered to manipulate you, even if the experience gets worse seemingly every year, because at least it isn’t as bad as the rest of the internet. We use Gmail because, well, at least it’s not Outlook. We use YouTube to view videos from other websites because other websites are far more prone to crash, have quality issues, or simply don’t work on mobile. We use Google Search, despite the fact that it barely works anymore, to find things because actually browsing the web fucking sucks. When every single website needs to make as much money as possible because their private equity or hedge fund or massive corporate owners need to make more money every year without fail, the incentives of building the internet veer away from providing a service and toward putting you, the reader, in silent service of a corporation. ESPN’s app is a fucking mess — autoplaying videos, discordantly-placed scores, menus that appear to have been designed by M.C. Escher — and nothing changes because Disney needs you to use the app and find what you need, versus provide information in anything approaching a sensible way. It needs your effort. The paid subscription model for dating apps is so aggressive that there’s a lawsuit filed against Match Group — which owns Tinder and Hinge, and thus a great deal of the market — for “gamifying the platforms to transform users into gamblers locked in a search for psychological rewards,” likely as a means of recouping revenue after user numbers have begun to fall. And if you’re curious why these companies aren’t just making their products less horrible to use, I’m afraid that would reduce revenue, which is what they do care about. If you’re wondering who else is okay with that, it’s Apple. Both Bumble and Tinder are regularly featured on the “Must-Have Apps” section of the App Store, most of which require a monthly fee to work. Each of these apps is run by a company with a “growth” team, and that team exists, on some level, to manipulate you — to move icons around so that you’ll interact with the things they want you to, see ads, or buy things. This is why HBO Max rebranded to Max and created an entirely new app experience — because the growth people said “if we do this in this way the people using it will do what we want.” Now, what’s important to accept here is that absolutely none of this is done with any real consideration of the wider effects on the customer, as long as the customer continues doing the things that the company needs them to. We, as people, have been trained to accept a kind of digital transience — an inherent knowledge that things will change at random, that the changes may suck, and that we will just have to accept them because that’s how the computer works, and these companies work hard to suppress competition as a means of making sure they can do what they want. In other words, internet users are perpetually thrown into a tornado of different corporate incentives, and the less economically stable or technologically savvy you are, the more likely you are to be at the mercy of them. Every experience is different, wants something, wants you to do something, and the less people know about why the more likely they are to — with good intentions — follow the paths laid out in front of them with little regard for what might be happening, in the same way people happily watch the same TV shows or listen to the same radio stations. Even if you’re technologically savvy, you’re still dealing with these problems — fresh installs of Windows on new laptops, avoiding certain websites because you’ve learned what the dodgy ones look like, not interacting with random people in your DMs because you know what a spam bot looks like, and so on. It’s not that you’re immune. It’s that you’re instinctually ducking and weaving around an internet and digital ecosystem that continually tries to interrupt you, batting away pop-ups and silencing notifications knowing that they want something from you — and I need you to realize that most people are not like you and are actively victimized by the tech ecosystem. As I said a few weeks ago, I believe that most people are continually harmed by their daily lives, as most people’s daily lives are on the computer or their smartphones, and those lives have been stripped of dignity. When they look to the media for clarity or validation, the best they’ll get is a degree of “hmm, maybe algorithm bad?” rather than a wholehearted acceptance that the state of our digital lives is obscene. Yet it’s not just the algorithms — It’s the entirety of the digital ecosystem, from websites to apps to the devices we use every day. The fact that so many people likely use a laptop that is equal parts unfit for the task and stuffed full of growth hacked poison is utterly disgraceful, because it means that the only way to escape said poison is to simply have more money. Those who can’t afford $300 (at least) phones or $600 laptops are left to use offensively bad technology, and we have, at a societal scale, simply accepted that this is how things go. Yet even on expensive devices you’re still the victim of algorithmic and growth-hacked manipulation, even if we’re aware of it. Knowing allows you to fight back, even if it’s just to stop yourself being overwhelmed by the mess, and means you can read things that can tell you what new horror we need to avoid next — but you are still the target, you are still receiving hundreds of marketing emails a week, you are still receiving spam calls, you are still unable to use Facebook or Instagram without being bombarded by ads and algorithmically-charged content. I’ve written a lot about how the growth-at-all-costs mindset of The Rot Economy is what directly leads big tech companies to make their products worse, but what I’ve never really quantified is the scale of its damage. Everything I’ve discussed around the chaos and pain of the web is a result of corporations and private equity firms buying media properties and immediately trying to make them grow, each in wildly different ways, all clamouring to be the next New York Times or Variety or other legacy media brand, despite those brands already existing, and the ideas for competing with them usually being built on unsustainably-large staffs and expensive consultants. Almost every single store you visit on the internet has a massive data layer on the background that feeds them data about what’s popular, or where they’re spending the most time on the site, and will in turn change things about their design to subtly encourage you to buy more stuff, all so that more money comes out, no matter the cost. Even if this data isn’t personalized, it’s still powerful, and turns so many experiences into subtle manipulations. Every single weird thing that you’ve experienced with an app or service online is the dread hand of the Rot Economy — the gravitational pull of growth, the demands upon you, the user, to do something. And when everybody is trying to chase growth, nobody is thinking stability, and because everybody is trying to grow, everybody sort of copies everybody else’s ideas, which is why we see microtransactions and invasive ads and annoying tricks that all kind of feel the same in everything, though they’re all subtly different and customized just for that one app. It’s exhausting. For a while, I’ve had the Rot Economy compared to Cory Doctorow’s (excellent) enshittification theory, and I think it’s a great time to compare (and separate) the two. To quote Cory in The Financial Times, Enshittification is “[his] theory explaining how the internet was colonised by platforms, why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, why it matters and what we can do about it.” He describes the three stages of decline: “First, platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.” I agree with Cory on some levels, but I believe he gives far more credit to the platforms in question than they deserve, and sees far more intention or strategy than really exists. I fundamentally disagree about the business customers even being some elevated class in the equation — as we’ve seen with the Google Ads trial, Google didn’t really give a shit about its business customers to begin with, has always sought a monopoly, and made things worse for whoever it needed to as a means of increasing growth. Perhaps that’s semantics. However, Cory’s theory lacks a real perpetrator beyond corporations that naturally say “alright we’re gonna do Enshittification now, watch this.” Where The Rot Economy separates is that growth is, in and of itself, the force that drives companies to enshittify. While enshittification neatly fits across companies like Spotify and Meta (and their ad-focused business models), it doesn’t really make sense when it comes to things where there isn’t a clear split between business customers and consumers, like Microsoft or Salesforce — because enshittification is ultimately one part of the larger Rot Economy, where everything must grow forever. And I believe the phenomenon that captures both is a direct result of the work of men like Jack Welch and Milton Friedman. The Rot Economy is selfish and potently neoliberal — corporations are bowed down to like gods, and the powerful only seek more, at all times, at all costs, even if said cost is “the company might eventually die because we’ve burned out any value it actually has” or “people are harmed every time they pick up their phone.” The Rot Economy is neoliberalism’s true innovation: a kind of economic cancer that with few reasons to exist beyond “more” and few justifications beyond “if we don’t let it keep growing then everybody’s pensions blow up.” To be clear, Cory is for the most part right. Enshittification successfully encapsulates how the modern web was destroyed in a way that nobody really has. I think it applies in a wide-ranging way to a wide range of tech companies and effects. I, however, believe the wider problem is bigger, and the costs are far greater. It isn’t that “everything is enshittified.” It’s that everybody’s pursuit of growth has changed the incentive behind how we generate value in the world, and software enables a specific kind of growth-lust by creating virtual nation states with their own digital despots. While laws may stop Meta from tearing up people’s houses surrounding its offices on 1 Hacker Way, it can happily reroute traffic and engagement on Facebook and Instagram to make things an iota more profitable. The Rot Economy isn’t simply growth-at-all-costs thinking — it’s a kind-of secular religion, something to believe in, that everything and anything can be more, should be more, must be more, that we are defined only by our pursuit of more growth, and that something that isn’t growing isn’t alive, and is in turn inferior. No, perhaps not a religion. Religions are, for the most part, concerned with the hereafter, and contain an ethical dimension that says your present actions will affect your future — or your eternity. The Rot Economy is, by every metric, defined by its short-termism. I’m not just talking about undermining the long-term success of a business to juice immediate revenue numbers. I’m thinking in broad ecosystem terms. The onslaught of AI-generated content — facilitated, in no small part, by Google and Microsoft — has polluted our information ecosystems. AI-generated images and machine-generated text is everywhere, and it’s impossible to avoid, as there is no reliable way to determine the provenance of a piece of content — with one exception, namely the considered scrutiny of a human. This has irreparably damaged the internet in ways I believe few fully understand. This stuff — websites that state falsehoods because an AI hallucinated, or fake pictures of mushrooms and dogs that now dominate Google Images — is not going away. Like microplastics or PFAS chemicals, they’re with us forever, constantly chipping away at our understanding of reality. These companies unleashed generative AI on the world — or, in the case of Microsoft, facilitated its ascendency — without any consideration of what that would mean for the Internet as an ecosystem. Their concerns were purely short-term. Fiscal. The result? Over-leverage in an industry that has no real path to profitability, burning billions of dollars and the environment - both digital and otherwise - along with it. I’m not saying that this is how everybody thinks, but I am convinced that everybody is burdened by The Rot Economy, and that digital ecosystems allow the poison of growth to find new and more destructive ways to dilute a human being to a series of numbers that can be made to grow or contract in the pursuit of capital. Almost every corner of our lives has been turned into some sort of number, and increasing that number is important to us — bank account balances, sure, but also engagement numbers, followers, number of emails sent and received, open rates on newsletters, how many times something we’ve seen has been viewed, all numbers set by other people that we live our lives by while barely understanding what they mean. Human beings thrive on ways to define themselves, but metrics often rob us of our individuality. Products that boil us down to metrics are likely to fail to account for the true depth of anything they're capturing. The change in incentives toward driving more growth actively pushes out those with long-term thinking. It encourages hiring people who see growth as the driver of a company's success, and in turn investment, research and development into mechanisms for growth, which may sometimes be things that help you, but that isn't necessarily the reason they're doing it. Organisational culture and hiring stops prioritising people that fix customer problems, because that is neither the priority nor, sadly, how one makes a business continue to grow. We are all pushed toward growth — personal growth, professional growth, growth in our network and our societal status — and the terms of this growth are often set by platforms and media outlets that are, in turn, pursuing growth. And as I've discussed, the way the terms of our growth is framed is almost entirely through a digital ecosystem of warring intents and different ways of pursuing growth — some ethical, many not. Societal and cultural pressure is nothing new, but the ways we experience it are now elaborate and chaotic. Our relationships — professional, personal, and romantic — are processed through the funhouse mirror of the platforms, changing in ways both subtle and overt based on the signals we receive from the people we care about, each one twisted and processed through the lens of product managers and growth hackers. Changes to these platforms — even subtle ones — actively change the lives of billions of people, and it feels like we talk about it like being online is some hobbyist pursuit rather than something that many people do more than seeing real people in the real world. I believe that we exist in a continual tension with the Rot Economy and the growth-at-all-costs mindset. I believe that the friction we feel on platforms and apps between what we want to do and what the app wants us to do is one of the most underdiscussed and significant cultural phenomena, where we, despite being customers, are continually berated and conned and swindled. I believe billions of people are in active combat with their devices every day, swiping away notifications, dodging around intrusive apps, agreeing to privacy policies that they don’t understand, desperately trying to find where an option they used to use has been moved to because a product manager has decided that it needed to be somewhere else. I realize it’s tough to conceptualize because it’s so ubiquitous, but how much do you fight with your computer or smartphone every day? How many times does something break? How many times have you downloaded an app and found it didn’t really do the thing you wanted it to? How many times have you wanted to do something simple and found that it’s actually really annoying? How much of your life is dodging digital debris, avoiding scams, ads, apps that demand permissions, and endless menu options that bury the simple things that you’re actually trying to do? You are the victim of a con. You have spent years of your life explaining to yourself and others that “this is just how things are,” accepting conditions that are inherently exploitative and abusive. You are more than likely not deficient, stupid, or “behind the times,” and even if you are, there shouldn’t be multi-billion dollar enterprises that monetize your ignorance. And it’s time to start holding those responsible accountable. I’m fairly regularly asked why this all matters to me so much, so as I wrap up the year, I’m going to try and answer that question, and explain why it is I do what I do. I spent a lot of time alone as a kid. I didn't have friends. I was insular, scared of the world, I felt ostracised and unnoticed, like I was out of place in humanity. The only place I found any kind of community — any kind of real identity — was being online. My life was (and is) defined by technology. Had social networking not come along, I am not confident I’d have made many (if any) lasting friendships. For the first 25 or so years of my life, I struggled to make friends in the real world for a number of reasons, but made so many more online. I kept and nurtured friendships with people thousands of miles away, my physical shyness less of an issue when I could avoid the troublesome “hey I’m Ed” part that tripped me up so much. Without the internet, I’d likely be a resentful hermit, disconnected from humanity, layers of scar tissue over whatever neurodivergence or unfortunate habits I'd gained from a childhood mostly spent alone. Don't feel sorry for me. Technology has allowed me to thrive. I have a business, an upcoming book, this newsletter, and my podcast. I have so many wonderful, beautiful friends who I love that have come exclusively through technology of some sort, likely a social network or the result of a digital connection of some kind. I am immensely grateful for everything I have, and grateful that technology allowed me to live a full and happy life. I imagine many of you feel the same way. Technology has found so many ways to make our lives better, perhaps more in some cases than others. I will never lie and say I don't love it. However, the process of writing this newsletter and recording my podcast has made me intimately aware of the gratuitous, avaricious and intentional harm that the tech industry has caused to its customers, the horrifying and selfish decisions they’ve made, and the ruinous consequences that followed. The things I have watched happen this year alone — which have been at times an enumeration of over a decade of rot — have turned my stomach, as has the outright cowardice of some people that claim to inform the public but choose instead to reinforce the structures of the powerful. I am a user. I am a guy with a podcast and a newsletter, but I am behind the mic and the keyboard a person that uses the same services as you do, and I see the shit done to us, and I feel poison in my veins. I am not holding back, and neither should you. What is being done to us isn't just unfair — it's larcenous, cruel, exploitative and morally wrong. Some may try to dismiss what I'm saying as "just social media" or "just how apps work" and if that's what you truly think, you're either a beaten dog or a willing (or unwilling) operative for the people running the con. I will never forgive these people for what they’ve done to the computer, and the more I learn about both their intentions and actions the more certain I am that they are unrepentant and that their greed will never be sated. I have watched them take the things that made me human — social networking, digital communities, apps, and the other connecting fabric of our digital lives — and turned them into devices of torture, profitable mechanisms of abuse, and find it disgusting how many reporters seem to believe it's their responsibility to thank them and explain why it's good this is happening to their readers. These are the people in charge. These are the people running the tech industry. These are the people who make decisions that affect billions of people every minute of every day, and their decisionmaking is so flagrantly selfish and abusive that I am regularly astonished by how little criticism they receive. These men lace our digital lives with asbestos and get told they’re geniuses for doing so because money comes out. I don’t know — or care — whether these men know who I am or read my work, because I only care that you do. I don't give a shit if Sam Altman or Mark Zuckerberg knows my name. I don't care about any of their riches or their supposed achievements, I care that when given so many resources and opportunities to change the world they chose to make it worse. These men are tantamount to war criminals, except in 30 years Mark Zuckerberg may still be seen as a success — though I will spend the rest of my life telling you the damage he's caused. I care about you. The user. The person reading this. The person that may have felt stupid, or deficient, or ignorant, all because the services you pay for or that monetize you have been intentionally rigged against you. You aren't the failure. The services, the devices, and the executives are. If you cannot see the significance of the problems I discuss every week, the sheer scale of the rot, the sheer damage caused by unregulated and unrepentant managerial parasites, you are living in a fantasy world and I both envy and worry for you. You're the frog in the pot, and trust me, the stove is on. 2025 will be a year of chaos, fear and a deficit of hope, but I will spend every breath I have telling you what I believe and telling you that I care, and you are not alone. For years, I’ve watched the destruction of the services and the mechanisms that were responsible for allowing me to have a normal life, to thrive, to be able to speak with a voice that was truly mine. I’ve watched them burn, or worse, turned into abominable growth vehicles for men disconnected from society and humanity. I owe my life to an internet I've watched turned into multiple abuse factories worth multiple trillions of dollars and the people responsible get gladhandled and applauded. I will scream at them until my dying fucking breath. I have had a blessed life, and I am lucky that I wasn't born even a year earlier or later, but the way I have grown up and seen things change has allowed me to fully comprehend how much damage is being done today, and how much worse is to come if we don't hold these people accountable. The least they deserve is a spoken or written record of their sins, and the least you deserve is to be reminded that you are the victim. I don't think you realise how powerful it is being armed with knowledge — the clarity of what's being done to and why, and the names of the people responsible. This is an invisible war — and a series of invisible war crimes — perpetuated against billions of people in a trillion different ways every minute of every day, and it's everywhere, a constant in our lives, which makes enumerating and conceptualising it difficult. But you can help. You talking about the truth behind generative AI, or the harms of Facebook, or the gratuitous destruction of Google Search will change things, because these people are unprepared for a public that knows both what they’ve done and their sickening, loathsome, selfish and greedy intentions. I realize this isn’t particularly satisfying to some, because you want big ideas, big changes that can be made. I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t know how to fix things. To quote Howard Beale in the movie Network, I don’t want you to write your Congressman because I don’t know what to tell you to write. But what I can tell you is that you can live your life with a greater understanding of the incentives of those who control the internet and have made your digital lives worse as a means of making themselves rich. I can tell you to live with more empathy, understanding and clarity into the reasons that people around you might be angry at their circumstances, as even those unrelated to technology are made worse by exploitative, abusive and pernicious digital manipulation. This is a moment of solidarity, as we are all harmed by the Rot Economy. We are all victims. It takes true opulence to escape it, and I'm guessing you don't have it. I certainly don't. But talking about it — refusing to go quietly, refusing to slurp down the slop willingly or pleasantly — is enough. The conversations are getting louder. The anger is getting too hard to ignore. These companies will be forced to change through public pressure and the knowledge of their deeds. Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative works because he's desperate for power. Every time you do this, you destabilise them. They have succeeded in a decades-long marketing campaign where they get called geniuses for making the things that are necessary to function in society worse. You can change that. I don't even care if you cite me. Just tell them. Tell everybody. Spread the word. Say what they've done and say their names, say their names again and again and again so that it becomes a contagion. They have twisted and broken and hyper-monetised everything — how you make friends, fall in love, how you bank, how you listen to music, how you find information. Never let their names be spoken without disgust. Be the sandpaper in their veins and the graffiti on their legacies. The forces I criticize see no beauty in human beings. They do not see us as remarkable things that generate ideas both stupid and incredible, they do not see talent or creativity as something that is innately human, but a commodity to be condensed and monetized and replicated so that they ultimately own whatever value we have, which is the kind of thing you’d only believe was possible (or want) if you were fully removed from the human race. You deserve better than they’ve given you. You deserve better than I’ve given you, which is why I’m going to work even harder in 2025. Thank you, as ever, for your time. Subscribe today. It's free.

As Big Tech invests billions into the expansion of their cloud infrastructure for A.I., companies are struggling to find workers with the skills needed for cloud computing roles. Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) seeks to address this talent gap through its AWS Skills Centers, offering a stepping stone for entry-level roles like IT support technicians, systems administrators, developers and engineers with salaries starting at $73,000 a year. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. AWS Skills Centers provide free, in-person training for local community members exploring cloud careers. Introduced in 2021, AWS’s learning hubs offer hands-on classes, workshops, exhibitions, immersive virtual reality experiences and certification programs as part of Amazon’s goal to train over two million people with A.I. skills by 2025. Courses range from introductory classes on generative A.I. to training for cloud practitioner roles, which are gaining traction. As of October, more than 145,000 students have participated in these programs across its three locations in Cape Town in South Africa and Amazon’s U.S. home bases in Seattle, Wash. and Arlington, Va., according to AWS. The global cloud computing market generated $602 billion in revenue in 2023 and is projected to grow 21.2 percent annually through 2030 as companies seek additional compute capacity to run A.I. workloads, according to Grand View Research. IDC forecasts that global annual spending on cloud services will reach $805 billion by the end of 2024 and double by 2028. That’s good news for AWS, which owns half of the global cloud market. Observer spoke with Jenni Troutman, director of AWS Training and Certification Products and Services, about the AWS Skills Centers and how they prepare students for cloud careers in an A.I.-driven world. Before joining AWS in 2017, Troutman held various leadership roles at New Relic, VMware and Accenture. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Observer: What was the impetus behind the AWS Skills Lab? How has the program evolved since its inception? Jenni Troutman: The original idea for the Skills Centers was to establish locations in high-traffic areas where there’s a significant need for cloud skills. That way, people curious about the cloud but unfamiliar with it could drop by, have a coffee, explore opportunities and decide if they’re interested in learning more. From there, they could begin a journey that might extend into other programs at the Skills Center or elsewhere. The first Skills Center opened at our headquarters in Seattle. It was a natural starting point because our executives and training team were already there, allowing us to test the concept. The response was strong—not just from learners but also from nonprofits and government organizations interested in helping their communities develop cloud skills. Now, we’ve expanded to locations in Arlington and Cape Town, South Africa. How does the AWS Skills Lab differ from college degrees in computer science or typical workforce development programs like coding boot camps? Does it offer any unique value to job seekers exploring alternative pathways into cloud computing? The Skills Centers offer hands-on classroom experiences led by AWS experts, where students can see how the skills they learn apply to industries like robotics and gaming. Additionally, we host sessions featuring employers and other organizations that share insights about careers in the cloud. Representatives from outside AWS discuss the skills they look for in employees for various roles. And importantly, all of this is free. What do you think is the advantage of AWS Skills instructors over computer science professors at universities? One key advantage is their real-world experience in understanding how AWS customers use our services. Another is their deep expertise in AWS tools and services. Students also have the chance to work directly with our service teams, getting a first-hand look at the types of projects they might work on at AWS. What misconceptions do students have about the AWS Skills programs? When I first heard about them, I assumed they were career development programs designed to land people jobs at AWS, but I’m sure they’re more nuanced than that. You’re right—it’s not solely about getting people job-ready. The Skills Centers are more focused on introducing students to the types of cloud jobs available and getting them started on their learning journey. For those who discover they have an aptitude for and interest in the cloud, we guide them toward next-level programs, like AWS Restart and AWS Cloud Institute, that prepare them for employment. The tech job market is tough right now, with many struggling post-layoffs and fierce competition. Does AWS tailor its skills programs to align with in-demand jobs? Despite challenges in the overall job market, there’s still a significant shortage of cloud professionals. The fastest-growing demand is for A.I.-adjacent roles like data scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers. Over the last two years, we’ve seen accelerated demand for skills in A.I., machine learning, big data and security, which have become some of our most popular courses. There’s also a notable wage premium for A.I. skills—up to 45 percent higher pay for roles in finance, HR, marketing, and sales that require proficiency with A.I.-powered tools. Job seekers often worry that A.I. automation will replace jobs. How does the AWS Skills Lab prepare students to remain employable in the face of these trends? A.I. will undoubtedly change jobs, but it will also create new ones. Existing roles will become more productive with A.I., as it allows for automation of routine tasks, giving people more time to focus on creativity and innovation. The Skills Centers help students understand these changes, demystify A.I., and show what’s possible. This is just the next major technological shift, similar to the rise of the internet. What specific skills taught at AWS are less likely to be replaced by A.I.? Creativity and innovation are irreplaceable. A.I. is a tool, but humans must define the application, solve problems, and generate ideas. Additionally, effectively using A.I. tools requires foundational skills. For instance, with coding companions like the Amazon Q Developer (formerly known as CodeWhisperer), you need to know how to craft prompts to get the desired results. Learning prompt engineering can significantly boost productivity. What’s next for the AWS Skills Lab? We’ll continue to refresh and adapt our training to ensure it remains relevant. This includes introducing new in-person experiences and programs. The cloud and tech landscape evolves daily, so it’s crucial for people to keep building and updating their skills to stay competitive.

Title: Logging Off: The Tech That Died in 2024
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/news/27525/logging-off-the-tech-that-died-in-2024
Time Published: 2024-12-16T13:00:00Z

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

It looks like we won’t have Cruise to kick around in this space anymore with the news that General Motors is pulling the plug on its woe-beset robotaxi project. Cruise, which GM acquired in 2016, fielded autonomous vehicles in various test markets, but the fleet racked up enough high-profile mishaps (first item) for California regulators to shut down test programs in the state last year. The inevitable layoffs ensued, and GM is now killing off its efforts to build robotaxis to concentrate on incorporating the Cruise technology into its “Super Cruise” suite of driver-assistance features for its full line of cars and trucks. We feel like this might be a tacit admission that surmounting the problems of fully autonomous driving is just too hard a nut to crack profitably with current technology, since Super Cruise uses eye-tracking cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead when automation features are engaged. Basically, GM is admitting there still needs to be meat in the seat, at least for now. Speaking of accidents, the results of the first aircraft accident investigation on another world were released this week, and there were a few surprises. Ingenuity, the little helicopter that hitched a ride to Mars in the belly of the Perseverance rover in 2021, surpassed all expectations by completing 71 flights successfully and becoming an integral part of the search for ancient life on Mars. But flight 72 proved to be a bridge too far and ended with a hard landing that terminally damaged its rotor system. At the time it was speculated that the relatively bland terrain it was flying over at the time of the accident was the root cause. This was confirmed by analysis of the flight logs, but the degree to which the flight computer’s down-looking navigation camera was confused by the featureless dunes is new information. As for why the rotor blades broke, it doesn’t appear that it was because they impacted the surface. Rather, as Scott Manley points out, the blades appear to have broken at their weakest point due to extreme flexing induced by the high vertical speed while touching down on a slope, which caused one set of legs to hit the surface before the others. Also roughly in the realm of space-based failures comes the story of a hapless senior citizen in New York who has been issued thousands of dollars in traffic tickets because of her love for Star Trek. Years ago, Long Island resident Beda Koorey got a New York vanity license plate for her car emblazoned with “NCC-1701,” the registration number of the USS Enterprise. She turned in those plates years ago when she gave up driving, but in the meantime, novelty NCC-1701 plates began popping up on Amazon and other sites. They were clearly not intended to be used on cars, but that didn’t stop some people from putting them on over their real plates in an attempt to defeat traffic cameras. It worked, at least from their point of view, since it left poor Beda with a collection of tickets for speeding and red light violations from as far away as Chicago. She even got a ticket for a violation committed by a motorcycle with a phony plate, which you think would not map to the registration for an automobile, but there you go. We always knew it was hard to be a Trekkie, especially back in the ’70s, but at least it never cost us much money. It did cost us a lot of dates, though. We featured plenty of stories of start-up tech companies with the next must-have IoT device that fold up shop after a few years and abandon their users by effectively bricking their widgets. Heck, we’ve even suffered that fate ourselves; curse you, Logitech, for killing the SqueezeBox. However, one company recently took IoT bricking to a new low by ending support for a line of AI-powered companion bots for kids. The company was called Embodied, and they hawked $800 AI bots for kids called Moxie, with a cute face and a huggable form factor that kids couldn’t help falling in love with. Embodied couldn’t make a go of it financially and since Moxie uses a cloud-based LLM to interact with kids, the bots are now bricked. This leaves parents who invested in these devices with the quandary of having to explain to young kids that their robot pal is dead. Some of the TikToks of parents breaking the news are heartbreaking, and we can’t help but think that this is a perfect opportunity for someone in our community to reverse-engineer these things and bring them back to life. And finally, the burning of the Yule Log is an ancient tradition, one that reminds us of the time our grandfather brought an entire telephone pole that had washed up on the beach home and burned it for days on end, feeding it slowly into the fireplace in the living room through the open front door. Good times. Not everyone is blessed with a fireplace in their abode, though, which has given rise to the popularity of video Yule Logs that you can just play on your TV. And now NASA is in on the action with an eight-hour 4K video of the SLS main engines and boosters. Framed by a lovely stone fireplace and replete with crackling wood sound effects over the subdued roar of the four RS-25 engines and twin solid-fuel boosters, it’ll make a nice addition to your holiday festivities. Although given that NASA just announced that the next Artemis missions are delayed until at least 2026, we’re not sure that it’s a great idea to show a rocket that never lifts off. You’ll also want to be careful that the neighbors don’t see the action. CGI fireplace, NASA, you can do better than that. They tried it with a real fireplace but it melted the house. Not just CGI, but really bad AI-generated fireplace. I just love a fireplace with a comforting basket of amorphous beige shapes in front, and a lumpy grate…thing… glued to the wall. The actual video footage is also only about three seconds being looped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-YhsEcQo Last year they did one that was just 45 minutes of RS-25 test footage with generic holiday music, which was honestly better. It seems like NASA has fired enough engines that it shouldn’t be hard to find a rocket engine filmed at a ridiculously high framerate so they could stretch a ten-second test into an hour or two of slow-motion. Could the air accident investigation be considered complete if JPL hasn’t recovered the “black box”? Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, so they just have to get it all out of thin air :o) You win. I was in SF a little while ago and was surprised to see that what seemed like every third car was a driverless Waymo or whatever they are called. So full driverless is absolutely still a thing and not at all impossible with current tech. Which really surprised me because I thought California banned all driverless cars.

Title: What You Need To Know If You're Considering A Job Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/12/15/considering-a-job-change-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-15T21:30:00Z

A growing number of employees are ready to make a job change. Recent Gallup data reveals that more Americans are considering a job change than at any point in the last 10 years. U.S. employees feel increasingly frustrated and detached from their work—something Gallup calls the "Great Detachment." Even more interesting, a PwC survey conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries shows that 28% of respondents are likely to change companies within the next 12 months. A growing number of employees are planning a job change due to increased workloads and the desire to improve their skills. “Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor...,” said Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK. Other reasons to consider a job switch are fewer promotions, smaller raises and impending layoffs. Despite feeling stuck in dissatisfying roles, many people are waiting to make a move until they feel more confident about their future prospects. In the meantime, a number of workers have already started job searching. The perfect time to switch jobs may be just around the corner. If you’re restless in your current role and ready to make a job change, here’s what you need to know. With the U.S. election over, companies that paused planning have the clarity they need to make budget and hiring decisions for 2025. Some experts predict a slow resurgence with a more robust jobs market in Q3. “My expectation is that by Q2 we will start to see a slight pickup, and, by Q3, we will be in a pretty robust jobs market,” says Rajesh Namboothiry, SVP at Manpower. Recruiters also remain optimistic, with seven in 10 remaining confident about job growth and hiring demand in the next 12 months, according to a recent Recruiter.com and Findem survey. That’s great news for those individuals planning a job change. In ManpowerGroup’s 2024 Global Talent Shortage report, 75% of companies globally report having difficulty finding skilled talent. The skills shortage is caused mainly by rapid technological advancements, like generative AI. With innovative technological solutions emerging, new skills are required to operate them. As a result, organizations in various industries like healthcare, technology and engineering are turning to new-collar workers to fill critical skill gaps. A new-collar job refers to positions prioritizing skills over a traditional four-year college degree. People often develop these specialized skill sets through non-traditional education paths like boot camps, certification programs or on-the-job training. Some employers are even training their current workforce to fill these positions. While some high-profile organizations like Starbucks, Amazon and others issue return-to-office mandates, others are open to more flexible options. Research and advisory firm Metrigy recently released their Employee Engagement Optimization 2025 study, indicating that employers are modifying their strategies to strike the right balance between on-site and remote work. In 2025, over half of those surveyed plan to adjust their requirements to balance the need for internal collaboration with what employees want. In fact, structured hybrid models following a predefined schedule continue to grow in popularity. According to the Flex Index Q4 2024 Flex Report, 43% of U.S. firms now have a structured hybrid model—up from 20% in 2023. As AI and other technologies reshape industries, leaders increasingly recognize the importance of hiring professionals with soft skills. In LinkedIn’s recent Global Talent Trends report, 69% of U.S. executives say they plan to prioritize hiring candidates with these skills. Unlike technical skills, soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI and are highly transferable across functions and industries. These assets are also a powerful differentiator during job interviews. When hiring managers are choosing between two strong candidates with equal technical skills, soft skills are often the deciding factor. Workplace advisory platform meQuilibrium predicts that there will be a “manager crash” or a significant decline in manager performance and well-being in 2025. Over the past several years, companies have been engaged in reducing headcount, particularly middle managers. For example, Citigroup reduced 13 management layers to eight, while Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. Most companies don’t intend to fill those roles, making it challenging for the remaining supervisors. The managers left behind take on much larger workloads and become increasingly disengaged. In addition, the lack of adequate company support puts managers at a higher risk of burnout and turnover than the people they supervise. If you intend to make a job change, focus on developing technical skills in high-demand areas. Also, prioritize building critical soft skills like adaptability, creative problem solving and collaboration. Stay updated on industry trends, network with thought leaders and evaluate your personal brand to give yourself a competitive edge.

But Jassy's messaging on an increased ratio of individual contributors to managers raises a much bigger question about organizational structure: What is the right balance between individual workers and managers in overall headcount? It's a question that corporations have long struggled to define with anything but anecdotal findings. With companies now firmly in a post-Covid world, organizational experts say Amazon may be leading the way in a new look at efficiency gains related to corporate bloat, and especially middle management bloat. "We have grown our teams quickly and substantially," said an Amazon spokesperson, echoing the message in Jassy's note: "When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years … Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B)." That growth, the spokesperson said, inevitably led to adding a lot of managers. Comparing Amazon's plan to Meta's recent year of efficiency, the spokesperson said the company ended up adding more layers than it had before due to its growth and now is the right time to bring the structure "closer to our customers" and reinforce Amazon's "culture of ownership." Over the past few years, layoffs have been as prominent as hiring in the tech sector. In 2022-2023, the sector was in what could be called the years of the layoff. While that headcount trimming continues, the Amazon thinking involves a broader rethink of how to rightsize the largest corporations. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested that Amazon could cut as many as 14,000 management positions, with the corporate efficiencies accounting for $2 billion-$4 billion in savings. Morgan Stanley's forecast was based on an assumption that Jassy made in the note that Amazon is targeting an increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers "by at least 15% by the end of 1Q25, across all divisions." Jassy pointed to "artifacts" of headcount growth, such as the "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings," and has created a "Bureaucracy Mailbox" for employees to share processes that slow down decision-making and that he said "crept in and we can root out." This is not a process that is unique to Amazon, said Joseph Roh, professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Rapid growth can lead to the rapid addition of "management layers without reassessing whether these roles are necessary," he said. In general, the flatter structure is in, and there is now greater emphasis on individual contributors across corporations. There is no exact formula, no "golden ratio" for contributor-to-manager. "My understanding is that the ideal ratio of individual contributors to managers depends largely on the nature of the work," Roh said, but he added that it is generally in the neighborhood of 7 to 10 individual contributors per manager. Investor and economic pressure play a role, and at a time when technology giants are spending billions on AI without being able to deliver to Wall Street immediate proof of the return on investment, a conscious effort to rein in other costs will be rewarded. And despite the fact that companies like Amazon want everyone back in the office, spit-balling ideas around the proverbial whiteboard or watercooler, there is a sense that AI already may be playing a role in a more direct way, with some middle management positions redundant. "Digital transformation plays a significant role," Roh said, "as automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software." "What you saw from Amazon is just the beginning," said Naeem Zafar, a professor at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Northeastern University, with the downsizing of the managerial layer a larger trend set to play out across corporate America. Technology companies that have dominated the economy and grown rapidly are leading the way, preaching the return to an approach of being nimble and innovative, but Zafar said there are also cultural factors at work. "The new generation of employees are different and work differently," he said, citing growing use of communication tools and a general work culture ethos that privileges freedom and balks at micro-management. According to Roh, organizations are adapting to the preferences of a younger workforce that "values less hierarchy and more autonomy in their roles." Zafar said the rise of AI alongside a new generation of workers reinforces this evolving view of managers. "Amazon's slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost-cutting; it's a glimpse into the future of work. Technology is eating away at the traditional corporate ladder, and middle management is feeling the bite," Zafar said. For decades, managers have been seen as "the glue holding companies together" and a key to translating strategy into action. But today, Zafar said, "AI-powered tools can analyze data, assign tasks, and track performance with unprecedented efficiency." That makes it inevitable that the question will arise, "Why pay for a middleman when a machine can do it better?" he added. Roh said Amazon's growth may make it an extreme example, but it is perhaps also a leading indicator. "Amazon's rebalancing reflects a broader corporate trend toward leaner, more efficient organizational structures, driven by the need for cost control, innovation, and competitiveness in rapidly evolving markets," he said. From health care to finance, companies are realizing that flatter hierarchies mean faster decisions and potentially bigger profits. As with any effort to improve efficiency and the bottom line, there are risks in an era of corporate flattening. Sacrificing employee well-being and the crucial human elements of leadership and innovation are challenges that will be at the center of this reshuffling in corporate America, Zafar said. But he added, "The future belongs to companies that can build lean, agile structures, empowering employees to thrive in a world where machines do the heavy lifting." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Media Insider: Omnicom and IPG – advertising’s global mega-merger and the impact on the New Zealand industry and clients
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/media-insider/media-insider-omnicom-and-ipg-advertisings-global-mega-merger-and-the-impact-on-the-new-zealand-industry-and-clients/GKZUJ2BWPVDZVMU7RY5RYS274E/

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The work of Kiwi creatives in global advertising firms has been world-class, including campaigns such as 'Ghost Chips', 'Driving Dogs' and 'Togs, Undies'. New Zealand’s advertising industry is in for a shake-up – amid fears of staff cutbacks, concerns about client conflicts, and broader market impacts – as two of the world’s biggest agencies merge to form a global behemoth. Omnicom’s (OMG) planned US$13 billion acquisition of IPG – announced in the US this week – is a seismic shift that will reverberate around the world, including in New Zealand, where major OMG brands such as PHD, OMD, Colenso, DDB, Clemenger, TBWA, Hearts & Science and Dynamo will be now housed under the same umbrella as IPG agencies such as FCB and Initiative. The OMG-IPG giant will become the world’s biggest advertising holding company, surpassing Publicis and WPP. The move and its market impacts are likely to be carefully monitored by the anti-competitive watchdog Commerce Commission as well as smaller, New Zealand-owned independent agencies and the broader industry. Sources say OMG agencies already lay claim to more than 50% of media spend in New Zealand; the new mega-merger will only reinforce that dominance. “As a result, OMG will command significant buying power which may place pressure on both media owners, who will likely be pushed to deliver the best price and value to OMG clients, and independent agencies, who may struggle to compete with these pressures,” said one source. “Managing conflict will be OMG’s main priority as clients may have concerns at how their businesses will be managed. At an initial glance, a newly consolidated OMG would have the three main telco clients (Spark, One NZ and 2degrees), almost all of the major banks and various other clashing clients.” But while big might seem beautiful, there will be plenty of nervous staff in the various agencies. “Behind the celebratory headlines and executive statements lies a stark reality for employees at Omnicom and IPG,” reported CEO Today. “The announcement’s promise of $750 million ($NZ1.3 billion) in cost synergies has sparked fears of widespread layoffs, particularly among overlapping functions and agencies.” One advertising analyst told the website: “Consolidation is the name of the game right now. This merger sets a new benchmark and signals that scale is no longer optional in an industry dominated by big tech platforms like Google and Amazon.” New Zealand sources believe it will still take some time for big changes, such as cutbacks, to filter to the local market. Even so, there would be broader market impacts. “The concentration of market power is quite a significant issue,” said one source. “You could ostensibly have DDB, FCB, Colenso and Clemenger all pitching for the same Government account, for instance. This might create the impression of different companies, but all essentially feed into the same mothership. From a procurement perspective, this could pose an interesting ethical dilemma for government departments. “How comfortable should a government department feel knowing that all those businesses are owned by the same organisation?” Client clashes and conflicts within agencies were also flagged as an industry concern. “Ad agencies have always been pretty good at managing this,” said one source. “It wasn’t that long ago that DDB had Westpac, Colenso BBDO had BNZ and TBWA had ANZ, despite all these agencies being owned by Omnicom. We’re going to see much more of that happening as even more brands are brought under the same umbrella. It now becomes a question of how comfortable clients feel about this – especially in the event that we do see some consolidation.” Independent Media Agencies of New Zealand (IMANZ) general manager Kath Mitchell said her members were resilient, quoting latest industry data showing 49% had expanded in the past 12 months and a further 28% had been stable. “However, we need to consider how far that resilience can stretch. Mergers like this mean we will see a concentration of greater market power in a single holding company. We should, at the very least, be having conversations about what impact that has.” She said data also showed 45% of IMANZ members did not have a single government client. “I would hope that the news of this merger helps to draw attention to how the industry is structured and how much power is concentrated in a small group of holding companies. “My advice to those who work in government procurement is to look deeper at agency ownership and often they will find they feed into one of those holding companies sending their profits offshore.” A Commerce Commission spokeswoman said the organisation had not received any material at this stage about the proposed global transaction, “but we are aware of it”. “We assess mergers using the substantial lessening of competition test. This test asks whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition by comparing the likely state of competition if the merger proceeds with the likely state of competition if the merger does not proceed. “We will give clearance to a proposed merger if we are satisfied that the merger is unlikely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a New Zealand market.” Omnicom chief executive John Wren said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” The deal is expected to be in place by the second half of next year. It perhaps seems questionable whether New York executives will be too bothered about seeking permission in this part of the world. The Commerce Commission spokeswoman acknowledged that filing for a merger clearance in New Zealand was voluntary. “The commission cannot require parties to file for clearance,” she said. “However, if parties do not file for clearance, and the commission forms the view that their transaction may have or may have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition, the commission can open an investigation into the transaction and ultimately take enforcement action which could result in significant penalties or a court reversing the transaction.” “It’s important to understand that the impact of this flows through to some of the best ad agency brands in this country,” says former NZ Herald advertising and marketing columnist Damien Venuto, now a senior account director at One Plus One. “If you look at the likes of DDB, FCB, TBWA, Colenso BBDO and Clemenger, you’re talking about the companies that have given us some of the most loved ads in the history of New Zealand. “Driving Dogs, the Lotto Pirate Ship, Togs-Undies and Ghost Chips are just some of the campaigns to have emerged from these brands. What you’re talking about here is talent and cultural history in our creative sector.” The deal meant that all profits that flowed through these companies would ultimately end up in the newly merged US-listed entity. “This, of course, isn’t new,” said Venuto. “As long as there have been holding companies, advertising money spent in New Zealand has flowed through to those global juggernauts. The difference now is that we have one less holding company competing for a cut of an even more consolidated pie. “I expect independent agencies, which New Zealand has in abundance, will look for ways to capitalise on this opportunity and play up their point of difference.” Mitchell said: “While our independent media agencies cannot compete with the scale of global holding companies, we bring agility, adaptability and innovation to the table to create bespoke strategies for clients. She said independent media agencies were able to implement innovative strategies that larger firms might be slower to adopt. The independents could “push creative boundaries without corporate constraints”, she said. Furthermore, independent media agencies were willing and prepared to collaborate with the global agencies when it made commercial sense for all parties involved, especially the client. “When you invest in a local independent media agency, you know every cent of that is staying in New Zealand. IMANZ members processed an estimated $570 million in annual billings last year and employ over 760 employees across the country – there’s a great opportunity for local to support local.” Meanwhile, Omnicom and some of their agency executives in this part of the world are not keen to comment at this stage. “Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any commentary at this moment. Thank you for your understanding,” said OMG APAC chief communications and talent experience officer Justin Low.

However, despite Siemiatkowski’s bullishness on AI, the company is not relying entirely on AI to replace human workers who leave, as open job listings — for more humans — and the company’s own statements confirm. “We stopped hiring about a year ago. We were 4,500, now we’re 3,500,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg TV. “We have a natural attrition, as [does] every tech company. People stay about 5 years — so 20% leave every year — and by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking.” The company’s CEO also said he believes AI can effectively replace workers. “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do,” said Siemiatkowski. “We’re gonna give some of the improvements [from] the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases.” Siemiatkowski often makes this variety of comments. To start 2024, the Klarna CEO said ChatGPT was doing the work of 700 human employees. At another point, he said that Klarna was dropping Salesforce as a CRM provider and replacing it with AI, a comment Marc Benioff expressed skepticism about. Just this week, the Klarna CEO made an AI deepfake of himself to report his financial results, attempting to prove that even a CEO can be replaced by AI. But in practice, while Klarna has significantly reduced its workforce in the last year, the buy now, pay later company has not completely stopped hiring. Klarna is currently hiring for more than 50 roles around the globe, according to the job postings page on its website. Furthermore, Klarna’s managers have said they are actively hiring or growing their teams at least half a dozen times throughout 2024, according to posts on LinkedIn viewed by TechCrunch. Klarna also hired several new employees in the last year to fill roles on its policy, software engineering, and global partnerships teams, according to LinkedIn posts from recently hired Klarna employees. Klarna’s global press lead, John Craske, tells TechCrunch that Siemiatkowski’s comments about hiring are directionally true but says the CEO was “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.” “When you look at it historically, we were hiring between one to one and a half thousand people a year from 2019 to 2022,” said Craske in an email. “Now, we’re not actively recruiting to expand the workforce but only backfilling some essential roles, predominantly engineering.” In other words, not every job can be replaced with AI today. While AI may be helping Klarna do more work with fewer people, it’s worth noting that Klarna has the same number of employees today as it did in 2021. Like most tech companies, Klarna was hiring a lot during the pandemic. Many companies, including Meta and Amazon, have reduced their workforces in the last few years, either by slowing down hiring or having layoffs. It’s also worth pointing out that Klarna is looking to IPO soon. Siemiatkowski could be trying to convince investors that his company is aggressively incorporating generative AI into its workflows and that the benefits are already showing up. But for most companies these days, AI adoption and implementation are happening at a much slower rate.
