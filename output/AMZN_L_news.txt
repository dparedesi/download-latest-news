Layoffs at firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have sharply focused on artificial intelligence as a catalyst for workforce reduction. Executives admit that automation will trim head counts in coming years, leaving many employees unsure whether experience offers better protection. Some predict that entry-level staff will be first to go because their routine duties automate easily; Anthropic’s chief executive even warned that half of all junior white-collar roles could disappear within five years. Others argue that older, well-paid employees who rely on long-established workflows are more exposed, especially if they fail to adapt. Early field data points toward pressure on newcomers. ADP payroll figures show employment for workers with less than two years’ tenure in computing roles fell about a quarter after peaking in 2023. Customer service jobs follow the same pattern. A temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy produced similar data: junior coders finished tasks slightly faster. However, mid-level developers used the tool to oversee peers and work across unfamiliar languages, raising their overall value. The threat to seasoned professionals is real, however. AI systems can now draft legal briefs and write production code, eroding the premium once attached to deep domain expertise. Law firms that deploy generative models report using roughly half as many contract attorneys and major tech companies continue to cut experienced managers and engineers while betting heavily on automation. As companies hire mostly junior workers boosted by AI and a handful of senior overseers, mid-level roles could disappear. That shift would shrink tax revenues and put more strain on unemployment benefits and other support programs. Lawmakers are already looking at ways to retrain displaced staff and make sure everyone shares in AI’s productivity gains. NY Times (in English)

Title: Big Tech Is Making Big Money. Time for More Layoffs?

Early this month, Microsoft confirmed it was axing 9,000 employees, or about 4 percent of its workforce, in its third staffing cut of 2025. One might suppose a company that’s been laying people off for three years straight isn’t performing well or is under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs and return to profitability. But that’s not the case here: In April quarterly earnings, Microsoft reported $25.8 billion net income on $70.1 billion in revenue, with optimistic guidance for Q2. Analysts have since improved their forecasts, and on Wednesday, the company’s stock hit an all-time high. Microsoft isn’t alone in cutting workers while things are going great. Since 2022, and most recently in January, Meta has been letting thousands of employees go; it, too, has been beating expectations and reporting massive profits. Google, after layoffs in 2023 and 2024, is now offering buyouts. But the Microsoft example might be the starkest. As recently as five years ago, America’s largest tech companies represented stable, lucrative, and futureproof employment. Collecting just the right qualifications might land you a role at Google or Facebook, where you’d have some of the best and broadest prospects in the entire job market, much of which was starting to look dreary in comparison. (They made an entire movie about being Google interns! Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were terrible in it!) Microsoft, the oldest of the bunch, represented stability twice over: a massive organization with a foot in the future, but also a place where you’d meet people who’d worked there for 30 years. As former employee Daniel Sada writes, some employees saw an implied pact. Microsoft didn’t quite pay as much as some of its peers, but it paid fine, and in exchange, “you [got] stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs.” Now, he says, “the pact is fundamentally broken.” At Microsoft — and across formerly safe big-tech firms — it’s been replaced with new feelings of precarity. From outside the industry, one might see this as an inevitable regression to the American employment mean: an industry where workers were temporarily distracted from, or just mistaken about, the true nature of their relationship with their employers. Things were good, workplace organizing was unnecessary, and everyone was on the same team, until they weren’t, and it was too late. Your job was just another job. From inside the industry — and Microsoft — the transition has been sudden and jarring. After the last round of layoffs, an executive producer at Xbox, where cuts were especially deep, posted a message from light-years outside any imagined “pact”: Matt Turnbull, Executive Producer at Xbox Game Studios Publishing - after the Microsoft layoffs - suggesting on Linkedin that may maybe people who have been let go should turn to AI for help. He seriously thought posting this would be a good idea. As he implies, the specter of AI hangs over these layoffs and others in the industry in unsettling ways. (One major wrinkle in the story of tech-employment exceptionalism is that programming might be one of the most AI-exposed job categories of all.) And while the last few years of layoffs can be understood substantially as a consequence of massive COVID-era overhiring and executive backlash, that excuse is starting to feel insufficient. Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which are still in cost-cutting mode, are major players in AI. Amazon’s CEO warned that, after it all nets out, AI deployment within the company will probably result in cuts; Meta and Google are bragging about how much code they’re already generating with AI. For now, they’re not connecting cuts with automation, but they’re getting close: Microsoft, while touting quantifiable savings and efficiency gains from AI, is also claiming that AI was “not a predominant factor” in recent layoffs. Given the types of jobs being targeted by the company — staffers in gaming, where the company is shifting focus for other reasons, and managers whose roles aren’t particularly exposed to current AI tools — this is probably true, narrowly speaking. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t connected. Big tech may be harvesting record profits, but it’s also collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars betting on AI (Microsoft committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures this fiscal year alone). Microsoft might not be LLMing its current employees out of their jobs today, but it’s making a massive and very public bet on its ability — and the ability of others, using its tools — to do so tomorrow. For now, maybe big tech is just looking for some extra cash for the cause. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: As tech CEOs predict AI will replace humans in just 5 years, this Fortune 500 boss says taking the focus off real people is a ‘recipe for failure’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. AI is already leaving its mark on corporate America, with tech layoffs hitting 75,000 this year alone as companies prepare for the technology to rival humans in just five years time. While this may fuel dreams of a two-day workweek—or fear an AI-fueled apocalypse—James Zallie, CEO of Fortune 500 food ingredient company Ingredion, has a clear answer: People—and culture—still come first. “If you take your eye off either the customer or the employee and you get very internally focused, it’s a recipe for failure,” said Zallie in an appearance on the Inside the Ice House podcast, hosted by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. And while Zallie’s $8.7 billion company has embraced technology like AI in part to predict supply chain issues, refine recipe formulations, and keep up with regulations—letting anything distract from people and culture could backfire, the baby boomer said. “I think in society today that if you don’t have a strong culture, your business will suffer. And if you don’t focus on people, you will also,” Zallie added. “People will see through whether you’re really living your values and whether you have a care for people in general.” At a time when some companies like Meta and Target have rolled back DEI initiatives, Ingredion still includes “Everybody Belongs” as one of its five core values. And while serving as CEO is the dream job title for most business leaders, Zallie said in reality, he more so sees his job as a chief clarity officer of sorts—the messenger of what the company is doing—and why. “We in positions of leadership and management have a responsibility and accountability to (employees) to continuously try to figure out on their behalf how they can have fulfilled careers, be motivated,” he said. “I look at my job as CEO as chief clarity officer.” Fortune reached out to Zallie for further comment. While Ingredion has made it clear that people are their priority, other companies are rather confident they can do more with less people. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said that his $2 trillion company would be shedding members of its corporate workforce thanks to generative AI’s enhanced capabilities. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote in an internal memo last month. Microsoft has already put some of this into action by laying off 15,000 employees this year alone. And while the company cited the changes as a means to “best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the cuts hint at prioritization of automation. Last year, AI saved the company $500 million in its call center alone, reports Bloomberg. And while some CEOs like Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Google’s Sundar Pichai have increasingly touted AI automation as somewhat of a flex, its replacement of workers has left many, such as software engineers, feeling helpless. Instead of using layoffs as a means to create a more leaner operation, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said the wiser move is to double down on talent. “The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,” Dohmke said to The Silicon Valley Girl Podcast late last month. “Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Flagship Will Shutter Its Marketplace, Citing Creator Disinterest

Creator tech firm Flagship quietly revealed it’s shutting down its core ecommerce platform, according to an FAQ initially posted on its website. The final day of sales on the platform is July 16. The company originated with that platform in 2023 and bet that creators would want to curate product recommendations and earn affiliate revenue using its platform. Over the past year, more than 1,000 creators and 500 brands used the Flagship marketplace to drive sales, cofounder and CEO Youssef Ahres told ADWEEK in an email. He added that some creators earned more than $200,000 a year through Flagship. But that wasn’t enough to sustain Flagship’s core platform. “Most creators—even highly effective ones—prefer creating content over running a storefront, and it was harder than expected to get them excited about promoting new or unfamiliar brands,” Ahres, said, adding it was difficult for creators to drive consistent sales. When Flagship launched, it set out to compete with affiliate giants like LTK. The startup is now pivoting its business around an AI-powered search engine connecting brands with creators called Radar. The company’s website was redesigned last week to promote Radar. Ahres did not respond if the pivot will result in layoffs. “We’re committed to building tools that help creators earn from their influence,” said Ahres. Flagship launched in 2023 and raised an undisclosed amount in seed and Series A funding. The company’s investors include VC firms Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures, and both will continue to back the company as it transitions away from its ecommerce platform product, according to Ahres. He did not respond when asked how much Flagship had raised in total. Flagship’s ecommerce platform attracted a community of creators looking to earn affiliate commission outside of Amazon. One such creator is Caroline Moss, the writer and host of the popular shopping newsletter and podcast, Gee Thanks, Just Bought It! Her newsletter and podcast storefront lived on Flagship, and she appeared on Flagship’s website and in promotional videos. Moss announced the shuttering of Flagship on the Gee Thanks Instagram account and expressed her sadness about its closure in a blog post. She praised the platform’s ability to connect her audience to small businesses and wrote, “it gave us a home that aligned with our values.” Moss didn’t respond to ADWEEK’s request for comment. Flagship’s closure hints that startups that specialize in affiliate linking might be under threat as major platforms like TikTok launch their own ecommerce features like TikTok Shop, and integrate Amazon shopping directly into the platforms. While investors’ interest in influencer marketing firms has grown over the past year, marketers increasingly look for more specialized tools that streamline manual processes like ad buying and managing creators.

Title: Job anxiety has workers misreading everyday signals

Good morning. It's the last day of Amazon's Prime Day sale, so time is running out to snag some of the best deals of the summer. The Reviews team at BI has gathered the best discounts for your home, kitchen, closet, and more — and they've tested all the items, too. In today's big story, welcome to the age of office paranoia, where layoffs, AI, and job insecurity are terrorizing workers. What's on deck: Markets: JPMorgan says retail investors will lead a stock-buying spree in the second half of 2025. Tech: A new city is vying to steal San Francisco's Big Tech crown. Business: Dear Starbucks, please don't force baristas to write on cups. But first, we need to talk. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. They think they're next. The company snacks are worse. The office air conditioning goes out. An unexpected meeting appeared on your calendar. The signs all point toward one thing: looming layoffs. Or not. Sometimes, things are just as mundane as they appear. It's what experts call "paranoid attribution," when employees read negative meaning into regular workplace occurrences. It's occurring in workforces across America. It's not hard to understand why: AI is threatening to take jobs, strict RTO orders are becoming more common, and the Great Flattening is coming for middle management. "Workers are feeling disempowered," said Michele Williams, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa. "They're looking for these social cues and overinterpreting social cues because of that insecurity." Meanwhile, the reality is that layoff rates are still low — relative to historic levels — and remain concentrated in white-collar sectors, especially at big-name companies that dominate headlines. In other words, things may not be as bad as they seem. But the paranoia is still reshaping the workplace. The fear isn't good for anyone, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. When employees are anxious about their career security, they probably aren't doing their best work. One worker that BI spoke with has completely changed her perspective on her career after getting laid off twice in two years. The first time was the day that she had arranged a return-to-office party for the workers reporting to her. "It's really hard to go to work every day and to know that you may not have a future here no matter how hard you work," she said. On the other hand, fear can be terribly efficient. When companies shift toward a more "hardcore" management style, they are generally banking on employees clinging to well-worn adages about becoming indispensable at work. Employees were supposed to become hyper-focused, not hyper-concerned. Now, staffers are looking at the corporate world a little differently — and some are turning their back on it altogether. Last chance of the year to observe "Manhattanhenge," when the sun sets in perfect alignment with the Manhattan street grid. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: TikTok poached Amazon employees to jump-start its US business. Now it's doubling down on its Chinese roots.

"Always day 1" is one of six core cultural principles at TikTok. The slogan, meant to inspire agility and urgency, might sound familiar. It was coined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Business principles aren't the only thing TikTok has taken from Amazon. When TikTok officially launched its e-commerce platform Shop in the US in 2023, it went on a hiring spree, poaching dozens of Amazon staffers to work in its Bellevue, Washington, offices, located a few blocks from some Amazon offices. By the end of 2024, TikTok had 1,700 employees there, according to the city's estimates. So many TikTok Shop employees came from Amazon that its early staff meetings sometimes felt like Amazon alumni reunions, current and former staffers told Business Insider. "It was Amazon left, right, and center," said one employee who came from Amazon. Another ex-Amazonian estimated that 75% of their 2023 TikTok Shop orientation group had previously worked at the e-commerce giant. Amazon showed up in operations, too. TikTok team members routinely shared insights about Amazon's business strategies, sometimes walking through documents taken directly from their former employer, two current staffers and one former TikTok staffer said. And just like at Amazon, employees crafted narrative memos to share products or ideas and allocated dedicated time for people to read them. Some tried to infuse TikTok with other Amazon strategies like customer obsession or single-person ownership of projects from start to finish. TikTok didn't want to be exactly like Amazon — its secret sauce was its social app with popular videos and an influencer network. But it really wanted Amazon's brand partners, and to replicate the customer shopping experience that had turned Amazon into a $2 trillion behemoth. Amazon controls about 40% of the total US e-commerce market, which could cross $100 billion in 2026, according to EMARKETER. If TikTok could peel away even a small percentage of customers, the opportunity would be huge. In some ways, TikTok never fully embraced a local-first approach to the US market. Despite hiring so many people in the US, its key e-commerce leaders continued to largely direct the business from China and Singapore. Then, last year, the US team began to fall short of its goals. Chinese leadership at ByteDance, TikTok's owner, began stripping some US executives' autonomy through changes to their reporting structures. A parade of US team managers left the company, and in their place, TikTok's parent company installed new leaders who weren't tapped into the Amazon playbook. Gone are the days of draining knowledge from America's most iconic e-commerce retailer. TikTok Shop leaders are focused on a different North Star: its Chinese sister app, Douyin. The changes on the Shop team mirror a broader shift within TikTok, which, even as it seeks an American buyer, has given more strategic power to leaders from China and Singapore. Some TikTok insiders feel the shift was inevitable. ByteDance leaders "weren't willing to listen to what strategies worked for Amazon that were relevant for TikTok," a former Shop staffer who worked with sellers said. They said leaders had a fixation on livestream selling — a big sales driver in China that did not translate as successfully to the US market. Leadership wanted "US representation and experience, but they didn't want to take a US strategy," this person continued. "It was a constant struggle between 'copy Amazon' and 'copy Douyin,'" a second former Shop worker said. TikTok and Amazon did not provide comment on this story. In 2023, TikTok recruited Nicolas Le Bourgeois, a nine-year Amazon veteran, to run TikTok Shop's US operations. Other Amazonians soon joined TikTok to boost sales in key product categories and staff roles like seller relationships, trust and safety, governance, operations, and logistics. Like Amazon, TikTok launched its own "Fulfilled by TikTok" business in 2023. It pushed sellers to ship products to US customers faster and established six US warehouses by October 2024, Le Bourgeois told BI last year. Amazon wasn't the only company where TikTok Shop sourced talent, but it was a big focus. The company hired people who had relationships with "US brands, heritage brands, household names, because they wanted us to basically convince those brands to get on platform," the former staffer who worked with sellers said. Some team members studied Amazon's product pages, its checkout process, and other core elements of its shopping experience. By early 2024, TikTok seemed to be making progress. Despite some users grumbling about seeing too many e-commerce videos, it was making strides in key metrics like customer retention. Some brands were reporting seven-figure hauls from TikTok Shop livestreams. But executives at ByteDance weren't happy. The app's sales were minuscule compared to Douyin, a dominant player in China that drives hundreds of billions in annual sales there. Bob Kang, ByteDance's e-commerce leader, called out the US team for missing 2024 goals in a February 2025 all-hands. The company was struggling with recruiting those "household name" brands in some product categories, and instead finding a lot more success with smaller sellers, often based out of China. ByteDance leadership began removing power from local US leaders in 2024, current and former staffers said. Then came a series of restructurings, two rounds of layoffs, and review-cycle exits over the first half of 2025. Many of the early ex-Amazon workers exited, replaced by executives with expertise working on Douyin. In April, Le Bourgeois was moved under former Douyin executive Mu Qing, no longer reporting directly to Kang. The next month, Le Bourgeois left the company, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Le Bourgeois did not respond to a request for comment. With Le Bourgeois gone, one staffer said it's become harder for US employees to communicate with ByteDance leadership. ByteDance leaders are now betting TikTok Shop's future on leaders with Douyin expertise. Douyin's e-commerce business is a crown jewel for ByteDance, and replicating its strategies in the US and other markets could pay off big if the rest of the world follows Chinese consumers in embracing social shopping. As TikTok Shop expands into additional markets, it's running many operations centrally out of China and Singapore. In April, the company heavily restructured its moderation team in Latin America to give control to Chinese and Singaporean leaders rather than local managers, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. In May, it flew Chinese staffers to São Paulo to support the rollout of TikTok Shop in Brazil. The company's swing back to its Chinese roots in the US may seem counterintuitive, as TikTok's ties to China prompted a 2024 US law that requires it to divest from its owner. But TikTok does not appear to be under imminent danger of shutting down; Trump has extended its divestment deadline three times since January. And TikTok may soon separate its US users into a country-specific app, The Information reported. The road ahead for TikTok Shop, as it faces business and political obstacles, will require embodying the "always day 1" agility the company lists as a core principle. After months of leadership changes, TikTok Shop is grappling with volatile sales in 2025 amid Trump's tariffs on China and the removal of a key import exemption, BI previously reported. While weekly order volume slumped in May compared to April after tariffs went into effect, the company wrote in a blog post last month that platform sales were up 120% year-over-year for the first two weeks of June. ByteDance is betting it can meet its e-commerce ambitions by leaning heavily on the expertise that made Douyin a leader in China. Some insiders say this could risk missing the US market nuances that local e-commerce workers might more easily spot. In many ways, they never committed to a local US strategy, the third staffer said. "It has always been 'rebuild Douyin' for the western market." Jump to

Title: How to Survive a Million-Dollar Loss

This year I’ve sprinkled occasional “Ecommerce Conversations” episodes with real-life master classes from Beardbrand, my company. To date I’ve addressed hiring, branding, profit-building, priority-setting, and exiting. For this installment, I’ll share Beardbrand’s experience of losing nearly $1 million across 2023 and 2024. I’ll recap how we managed to survive our worst years in business while remaining 100% bootstrapped. It got bad. Our cash levels dropped to where they were in year one, 2014. We were hemorrhaging money. But we’re still here — still building and still learning. We made it through without outside funding. Here’s what the future holds for Beardbrand. My entire audio dialog is embedded below. The transcript is condensed and edited for clarity. A big portion of our loss came from Target. The company had been a seven-figure account for us for years, and we thought the relationship was solid. Every year, we pitched Target our plans. Historically, the staff there provided us with clear feedback — what worked, what didn’t, and where there was room for growth. In 2023, Target had a sustainability initiative. We revamped our packaging, switching from glass and plastic to aluminum. It’s lighter, more recyclable, and aligns with eco-conscious goals. At the same time, we increased the size of our beard oil packaging from 1 oz. bottles to occupy more shelf space and stand out. We committed early, produced inventory, and delivered Target’s purchase orders on time. Then silence. Nothing. After years of working with us, the staff ghosted us. No feedback, no responses. Worse, they dropped us and left us with nearly $200,000 of unpaid product. We erred by giving Target exclusivity, which meant we weren’t selling on Amazon or Walmart. That killed our ability to move leftover inventory quickly when they dropped us. By the time we finally got on Amazon, the products had already aged out. We destroyed a large quantity that had expired. We’ve always run Beardbrand conservatively. That means keeping a decent amount of capital in reserve — not because we’re paranoid, but because you never know when a black swan event might hit. Having that runway lets you make clear, intentional decisions rather than panicking. It gives you time to explore solutions, test channels, and get a better night’s sleep. Thankfully, during our stronger years, we built up a solid cushion. And that cushion is what kept us afloat during the downturn. We essentially burned through all of it. But we never dipped below zero, which meant we didn’t have to take out high-interest loans, open lines of credit, or bring in outside investors. We did have conversations just in case. I even considered withdrawing money from my personal savings. But that’s a hard decision when things aren’t going well. When you’re in the middle of the storm, it doesn’t feel like a temporary dip — it feels like a freefall. You start wondering: Is this the bottom, or is there more pain ahead? Writing another personal check to the business, especially after years of building wealth from it, was not something I wanted to do. And neither did my partners. We were determined to find a way forward that didn’t involve doubling down with personal capital or giving up control. In addition to losing Target, we experienced a series of setbacks. First, the state of Texas audited us. We cooperated fully, waited for the final numbers, and instead got slapped with a tax lien. That lien triggered Brex, our corporate credit card provider, to freeze our account, despite our perfect payment history. Thankfully, American Express stood by us and kept things moving. Then came an ADA lawsuit, a leaked 100% off coupon code, and a $20,000 air conditioner repair at our barbershop. We also faced regulatory changes that forced us to reformulate key fragrances. We had internal missteps, such as losing a key growth team member and coasting when we should’ve pushed harder. We focused on profitability, but the business slowly declined. We simplified our product line to meet a manufacturer’s needs, which, in hindsight, proved to be a mistake. The lesson? Partner with vendors who value your business. You don’t want to be too small to matter, or too big to be managed. That relationship needs to be just right. We also lowered prices to drive volume, but it backfired. Loyal customers just paid less, and those who thought we were expensive still did. Meanwhile, larger packaging reduced purchase frequency, and killing off beloved fragrances hurt loyalty. Top-line revenue got cut in half. Furthermore, when your business shrinks, fixed costs such as office leases and payroll can become overwhelming. Our $10,000 per month lease that once felt small became a big deal. The good news? Beardbrand is alive. We’ve weathered the storm and slowly started turning things around. It hasn’t been a dramatic rebound — it’s been steady, slow progress. We have focused on improving operations, addressing inventory issues, resolving stock-outs, tightening pricing, and enhancing product quality. We now have the right fulfillment provider, manufacturing partners, and systems in place. Instead of existential crises, we’re dealing with everyday stuff — shipping issues, ad performance, and the occasional bad product batch. That’s a massive shift. It’s not glamorous, but it’s no longer a matter of survival. We cut costs aggressively — even eliminating $15 per month software. We reestablished healthy margins. Our customer service, returns, and product quality all depend on having room to breathe financially. The Target fallout is behind us, the tax lien is resolved, and the ADA plaintiff dropped the bogus lawsuit. My business partner stepped out of day-to-day operations, and some team members transitioned to part-time roles, which helped improve our cash flow. We’ve managed all of this without layoffs. My team is the same one that helped us grow, and they’re still incredibly talented and dedicated. I’ve also cut my own salary and lived off personal savings to keep things afloat. But I’m optimistic. With the business stabilizing, we can rebuild our savings and start exploring new growth opportunities again. July 30, 2021 Survival mode means focusing on making it through the day. Some entrepreneurs try to grow their way out of problems. For us, it started with stabilizing operations. We can finally think long-term again. We’ve begun reinvesting in growth, supporting our paid media and Meta efforts, and expanding our creative team to produce more content and ads. More creative output means more chances to connect with customers and fuel a rebound. We’re also rethinking channels beyond direct-to-consumer. Target was a strong retail partner for years. Retail as a channel still holds potential — perhaps it’s independent salons, boutique pharmacies, and grocery stores. The goal is to diversify. Beardbrand.com will always be our home base, but we’re a business that sells to people, not just an ecommerce brand. It’s exciting to think ahead instead of looking back. We’re aiming for 7% profitability this year — that’s breakeven in my book. It provides us with a buffer for unpredictable events, such as lawsuits, audits, and air conditioning failures. The real goal is 17% profit — that’s when we can fund growth, hire employees, and breathe easier. Anything beyond that is the sweet spot where the stress and sacrifice start to feel worth it. I’m excited again — for the team, for the future, and what we’re building. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

Title: There’s a rumor that Jeff Bezos will ‘buy’ Conde Nast for Lauren Sanchez

Full Content:
For weeks now, people have theorized about Anna Wintourâs sudden decision to step down as editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Considering her decision came right around Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchezâs wedding – and Laurenâs digital Vogue cover – many people (including me) connected the two. I theorized that Wintour felt forced into putting Lauren on the cover in some way, and she basically had enough and perhaps rage-quit that bitch. But what if it was much more complicated than that? This week, the Daily Mail had an odd exclusive – thereâs a theory being bandied around the media world that Bezos will soon purchase Conde Nast as a âgiftâ for Lauren. Bezos already owns the Washington Post, and perhaps he wants to âgiveâ Vogue to Lauren? Fashion ‘bible’ Vogue could soon be owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, sources say. Staff are convinced the world’s fourth-richest man is preparing to buy parent company Conde Nast as a wedding gift for his bride Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist. Many believe it’s no coincidence that the new Mrs Bezos is this month’s digital Vogue cover star and graces its pages wearing a Dolce & Gabbana wedding gown hand-picked by Dame Anna Wintour. Last month Dame Anna announced she was stepping down as Vogue Editor-in-Chief after 37 years in the role but remains in control of global operations. The Newhouse family, who have owned Conde Nast since 1959 and continue to hold it privately under their media empire Advance Publications, insist their titles are not on the market. And last night, a source close to Mr Bezos said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he was considering buying Conde Nast. But with a recent swathe of global redundancies and UK staff now operating from an uninspiring WeWork space near Waterloo station â after Vogue’s Hanover Square HQ was sold â not everyone is convinced. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rumour that Jeff is going to buy Conde Nast is all anyone’s talking about in the fashion industry and inside Vogue. Lauren Sanchez is such an unlikely cover star, and the word is that she landed the July issue partly because the Newhouse family want to butter up Bezos. In New York they’re slimming down the business which is exactly what companies do before a sale.’ The source added: ‘Anna is said to be the one brokering the deal so that’s why Lauren was put on the cover. Anna has equity in the business so has a lot to gain from a sale.’ Mr Bezos is no stranger to publishing. In 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million in cash, ending the Graham family’s four-generation ownership. Another source said: ‘He’s one of the very few people with deep enough pockets. And Lauren is no airhead. She’s a sharp cookie. There have been conversations.’ Insiders say several clues point to something big in the offing. Natalia Gamero Del Castillo, MD of Vogue’s European operations, suddenly ‘disappeared’ from the office last week, prompting her colleagues to suggest she had either quit or fallen victim to the global redundancy drive. The source added: ‘There have been redundancies almost every week in Europe and New York. The UK has had a whole round too. ‘What they’re doing is aligning every publication globally so the structure is uniform across all titles. Anna was the anomaly, she was the only Editor-in-Chief left. GQ has a Global Editorial Director, Glamour has one, Vanity Fair too. So she had to give up the title. I don’t think she was thrilled but she accepted it, probably because she knows the company is getting ready to sell. She still has huge influence but she’s no longer Editor-in-Chief. That title is gone. They’re streamlining everything. Either we’re about to go under or we’re being sold. But something is up and everyone’s talking about Bezos.’ [From The Daily Mail] Unlike most of the Mailâs unhinged reporting, I actually think there could be something here, regardless of the denials from Bezosâ camp. When you think about it, Conde Nast would be something which would interest Bezos, especially as a âgiftâ for Lauren. That being said, the Conde Nast layoffs and streamlining are mostly about the death of print media. Conde Nast is taking a lot of losses and they have been for years. Whichâ¦ makes them ripe for a buyout from a deep-pocketed billionaire. Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos essentially rented out Venice and likely paid celebrities to attend their wedding festivities.

The right wing media ecosystem is already vast, but they want to make it more vast. They have to keep people stupid and brainwashed in the right wing way or theyâll begin to notice things like, ohâ¦ the idiot right wing residents of Kerr County, Texas, encouraging the county to turn down âBidenâsâ money that could have gone to something like, maybe, a flood warning system. (In the end the county took the money but used it for other emergency service communications upgrades. Probably a fine use of the money, but in retrospect they probably had something for that that already worked and they didnât have a unified flood warning system). Print media wouldnât have problems if they actually cared about their readers. I buy magazines to read them and the actual reading part has been getting slimmer and slimmer for years as the price of the magazines have continued to rise, making it pointless.

No. If the economy really tanks, he isn’t as wealthy as people assume he is because most of his wealth is tied to the stockmarket and most of his products aren’t essential and are obtainable from other sources. How many businesses can he have with the intent of losing money? WAPO was calculated to some extent because he was buying his piece of the president/politics. (Doubtful he thought an organized boycott would take place and he would lose millions though). If he buys CN he will lose big money because he is approaching Muskrat levels of brand toxicity. The idea of Lauren’s blow-up doll tackiness being further normalized is disheartening . Rich people have completely lost the f#cking plot.

Title: 8BitDo updates its fantastic phone controller with an Xbox-inspired design

Time Published: 2025-07-11T10:44:34Z

Daryl Baxter Published: Jul 11, 2025 Another week means another Xbox partnership, this time with 8BitDo. So far this year, we've seen Microsoft work with manufacturers like Backbone and Meta, as well as with Asus for its upcoming Xbox handheld. We're definitely in a transition of seeing Xbox branch out beyond just its consoles and Game Pass offerings, but now it's 8BitDo's moment. Having released its mobile controller for iPhone and Android devices in October last year, you can now buy an Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller, which also comes with some software updates. Available now via Amazon for $49.99, the Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller comes in black or white and can fit most Apple iPhones and Android devices. Instead of slotting these phones into a USB-C port, the controller connects to them via Bluetooth, so the controller can also connect to your Apple Mac or Windows PC. The triggers and joysticks have been upgraded to be Hall effect, meaning they'll be more precise and more reliable over long periods. However, as this is Xbox-branded, there's a dedicated Xbox button that brings up its Cloud Gaming service when pressed, instead of 8BitDo's native app. It's another extension of Xbox's 'Play Anywhere' ethos, bringing another option to Xbox fans with the best gaming phones. As an owner of an 8BitDo Pro 2 Controller for several years, which is now paired to my Nintendo Switch 2, I've always found the peripherals to be great. From the designs to the long-lasting battery, I've never had an issue with 8BitDo. It was a natural step for the company to bring out a mobile controller last year for iPhone and Android devices. While I use a Backbone One Halo Edition controller for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I'd definitely consider 8BitDo's take if it ever gave up the ghost. With Backbone's Halo Edition controller and the Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition, it's yet another effort from Microsoft to reassure customers that its gaming business is here to stay, despite recent layoffs that have led to the cancellation of games like the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, as well as the shutting down of some studios. Still, we'll be more convinced when we finally get our hands on the much-anticipated new Fable game. If you've been an Xbox fan since the early days and want to have something that fits with your smartphone when playing games like Fortnite and PUBG Mobile, the Xbox Edition of 8BitDo's Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller will be a great option. In the meantime, check out our guides to the best gaming tablets and the best mobile controllers if you're thinking of an upgrade for both.

Title: 2025 Trump jobs report shows historic labor shift: Native-born gains hit 2 million as foreign-born employment plummets

U.S.-born workers gained 2.056 million jobs since January 2025; foreign-born employment dropped 543,000. Trump administration attributes gains to immigration enforcement and economic policies favoring native workers. June 2025 data marks fourth consecutive month of job growth exceeding forecasts. Sector growth concentrated in healthcare, education and government; private sector sectors lagged.

Critics warn of labor shortages in construction and agriculture as foreign-born workers exit workforce. The U.S. Department of Laborâs June Employment Situation Report revealed a seismic shift in the labor market under President Donald Trumpâs administration: Native-born workers have earned 2.056 million jobs since January 2025, while foreign-born employment fell by 543,000. The Household Survey data, highlighting a stark demographic divergence, has become a focal point of the Trump White Houseâs narrative of prioritizing American workers amid tightening immigration policies. In June alone, native-born Americans added 830,000 jobs, pushing their total labor-force participation to a record high of 132.65 million. By contrast, foreign-born workersâwhich include both legal and unauthorized immigrantsâreported a 348,000 drop in June and a 543,000-year-to-date decline. The turnaround contrasts sharply with 2024, when foreign-born employment rose 1.025 million under the Biden administration, nearly matching native-born gains of 1.099 million. âThis economy is booming again,â declared White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on July 9. âAmerican-born workers have accounted for ALL of the job gains since President Trump took office, and wage growth continues climbing. These numbers prove our policies are working.â The report solidified a trend Trumpâs team has emphasized since reclaiming the White House: dismantling policies perceived as disadvantaging U.S. workers. White House communications have repeatedly framed the data as proof of fulfilling promises to prioritize native-born labor force participation, long a cornerstone of Trumpâs political identity. Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks. White House officials argue this has incentivized businesses to hire native-born Americans, who now dominate job growth. The report coincided with record-monthly deportations: 188,000 unauthorized immigrants removed in June, a 55% increase over Januaryâs totals. Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 147,000 in June, led by the nearly 200,000-worker surge in healthcare and educational servicesâa trend attributed to federal spending mandates for clinics and public schools. Yet the expansion was uneven. Private sectors outside healthcare faltered, with manufacturing and technology firms announcing 18,000 layoffs in June. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, near historic lows, but broader Labor Department metrics show rising hardship for foreign-born workers: about 820,000 filed for unemployment claims since January, many citing workplace crackdowns as cause. Soutbay Research analysts warned of fragility: âJuneâs strong headline numbers depend largely on volatile sectors,â including government jobs and public education. âA harsh winter season or federal funding lull could unravel progress.â Public sector dominance has also drawn scrutiny, with critics questioning the sustainability of government-linked employment in a 13th consecutive month of economic expansion. The road ahead: Legislative hopes and theÂ âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ early test The Biden-era Paycheck Protection Programâs expiration and a contentious debate over the âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ loom large over Trumpâs economic agenda. The proposed law would formalize policies to restrict foreign labor and expand vocational training for Americans, a pillar of the administrationâs jobs strategy. âOnce Congress passes the One Big Beautiful Bill, these numbers will explode,â Leavitt declared, predicting a 30% acceleration in job creation by 2026. The act faces fierce opposition, notably from Republican moderates wary of labor shortages stifling economic growth. As the 2026 elections approach, the reportâs triumphs and tensions reflect deeper ideological divisions. For the Trump team, the 200,000-plus monthly native-born gains since January 2025 vindicate the central campaign pledges of an economy âbuilt for Americans first.â Yet as sectors like agriculture reel, the debate over whether that approach serves all Americans continues apace. A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce. These measures, which prioritize domestic labor over outsourcing and restrictive trade deals, signal a vital step toward reversing decades of wage stagnation and job displacement caused by flawed immigration practices and globalist agreements. As Congress advances the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the labor marketâs evolution underscores the imperative to prioritize U.S. sovereignty and fairness for working families. By curbing reliance on foreign worker visas, securing borders and renegotiating trade terms that favor American industries, policymakers have laid the groundwork for a economy that rewards hardworking Americansâensuring long-term prosperity rests on a foundation of domestic strength, equitable wages and a clear focus on who matters most: the people of this nation.

Sources for this article include: YourNews.com FoxBusiness.com FastBull.com Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks. White House officials argue this has incentivized businesses to hire native-born Americans, who now dominate job growth. The report coincided with record-monthly deportations: 188,000 unauthorized immigrants removed in June, a 55% increase over Januaryâs totals. Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses.

July 10, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Forbes Daily: Nvidia Reaches A $4 Trillion Milestone

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI juggernaut Nvidia just crossed another milestone: a $4 trillion valuation, the largest in history. The firm, which was worth just over $10 billion a decade ago, now outranks household names like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in training advanced artificial intelligence programs. It’s hard to grasp just how much money $4 trillion is, but for some context: The company of less than 40,000 people is now worth more than 97% of the world’s economies, the entire New York area real estate market and the combined net worth of the 30 richest people in the world. Linda Yaccarino X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation Wednesday, just one day after Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok made a series of antisemitic comments on the social media platform—though a source told NBC News that the exit has been in the works for over a week. On X, Musk wrote: “Thank you for your contributions,” in response to the former advertising executive’s departure after a two-year stint leading the company. It’s unclear who will succeed her. MORE: Later Wednesday night, xAI launched the latest and most advanced version of its AI model: Grok 4. In a nearly hour-long livestream, Musk and xAI staffers demoed the new model, which Musk said was “smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously.” The billionaire did not address Grok’s recent controversial posts. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Good news for investors eagerly awaiting lower borrowing costs: Most Federal Reserve officials still expect interest rate cuts this year, according to minutes released from its recent meeting, but tariffs could complicate the Fed’s efforts to fight price increases. Still, many members of the central bank’s rate-setting panel noted that the inflationary impacts of tariffs could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon. As President Donald Trump suggested he’d implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, the price of the metal skyrocketed in its largest intraday surge since the 1980s, before paring back some of its gains Wednesday. The levies would likely increase prices for copper in the U.S., analysts predicted, as just over half of the total refined copper consumed in the U.S. is imported. MORE: Higher copper costs could also lead to an increase in crime, as the metal would become a valuable target for thieves. It’s the third-most consumed metal in the U.S., with uses ranging from electrical wiring in buildings to computers and cars, and is often stolen from construction sites. Critics of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” argue that it takes from the poor to benefit the wealthy, but not all billionaires are celebrating its passage. Some of the bill’s measures are more likely to help multi-millionaires than billionaires, and a number of the world’s richest people are concerned about the expected $3.4 trillion that will be added to the deficit by 2034 as a result of the legislation. One estate planning attorney told Forbes some of his billionaire clients are moving more of their wealth offshore to “more stable economies.” Adam Valkin, who helped grow General Catalyst into a global venture capital powerhouse, wants to help Israeli founders break into the U.S. market in his new role at Vine Ventures. Valkin will help the firm invest in the country known as “Startup Nation,” as—despite experiencing a drop in investments after the October 7 attack—Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion so far in 2025. After Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital received swift backlash for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a letter supporting the venture capital firm partner garnered hundreds of signatures. The letter defending Maguire claims his remarks, including accusing Mamdani of being an “Islamist,” did not constitute hate speech, even as nearly 1,000 tech founders demanded Sequoia take disciplinary action. Carlo Ancelotti Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been sentenced to one year in prison and will pay a hefty fine after being found guilty of tax fraud. He had been accused of failing to pay over $1.1 million in Spanish taxes related to image rights. Managing Real Madrid is a big deal in the world of professional sports—the team topped Forbes’ list of The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams in 2025, the fourth year in a row it ranked No. 1. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s wildcard entry into the Hall of Fame Open tennis tournament ended in swift defeat Wednesday, drawing criticism from fans and officials who questioned whether the hedge fund manager had earned his spot in the professional event. Participants in the tournament are typically selected based on ATP rankings, wildcard entries and qualifiers. Randy Walker, the director for the Vero Beach Futures tennis tournament, posted on X after the match: “I just watched the absolute worst professional tennis match I have ever seen.” Photo by Matt Roth for The Washington Post via Getty Images Even as child care remains a major hurdle for many working parents, few companies are taking advantage of a federal tax break given to firms that provide child care for their employees, according to IRS data. But the just-signed tax and budget bill includes a little-known provision that more than triples the Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit, and data shows that child care benefits are helping companies’ bottom lines. Les Wexner Five years ago, Ohio’s most revered entrepreneur Les Wexner stepped down as chairman of L Brands and soon began to sell off his stake in the Victoria’s Secret parent company amid controversy over his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Many believed that Wexner, then age 82, would quietly retire. Instead, the fashion mogul has more than doubled his fortune thanks in large part to some savvy bets in a different industry: technology. Over just the past three months, his net worth—which includes assets held in his children’s and wife Abigail’s names—has soared to $10.1 billion from $7.9 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates. The biggest driver of this increase: a 4% stake in CoreWeave, one of the buzziest artificial intelligence companies. On Monday, CoreWeave announced it is buying crypto miner Core Scientific in a roughly $9 billion all-stock deal. CoreWeave’s market capitalization has almost tripled since its March IPO to nearly $73 billion today, and Wexner’s stake is now worth $2.8 billion. The eight-year-old CoreWeave helps companies build data centers and loans out cloud access to much-sought-after graphics processing units, or GPUs, which firms like Microsoft, IBM and Meta pay to use to build AI models. With no shortage of customers, the company recorded $982 million in revenue during the first quarter of this year, a 420% increase versus the same quarter last year. However, it’s yet to turn a profit and reported a net loss of $315 million during the same period. WHY IT MATTERS “After originally making a fortune in fashion, Wexner has become one of the biggest (and most unlikely) winners of the AI gold rush,” says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. “In addition to becoming an early backer of the $73 billion (market cap) CoreWeave, one of the buzziest AI companies around, Wexner's real estate development firm has played a crucial role in bringing big tech players like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel to Central Ohio.” MORE How Victoria’s Secret Billionaire Owner Accidentally Scored A $800 Million Stake In An AI Unicorn Millions of borrowers will soon be on the hook for thousands of extra dollars as the Trump Administration is slated to start charging interest next month on student loans under the Biden-era SAVE plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have had their loans in forbearance since last summer while it’s been held up in court: About 7.84 million: The number of borrowers with loans under the SAVE plan that will be affected by the change $3,500: The amount in additional interest per year that the average borrower enrolled in the SAVE plan will be charged, which works out to about $300 per month 1.5 million: How many applicants for income-driven repayment plans were yet to be processed, the Education Department said in a June court filing Many employees have experienced “quiet firing,” where a manager makes a work environment so unpleasant that it pushes people to quit. Sometimes quiet firing occurs because a boss isn’t doing their job, or it could just be part of the company culture—it’s an easier way for firms to reduce headcount without very public layoffs. If you’ve been silently pushed out, try not to take it personally: You deserve a workplace that supports your growth.

After massive layoffs across Microsoft and its gaming studios, there hasn't been a lot of good news for the Xbox team. It's small comfort to those who lost their jobs, but Microsoft had a dominant month in May 2025 with four out of the top five best-selling games in the US. Circana has shared its report for video games sold in May, and the only game in the top five that wasn't published by Microsoft was Elden Ring Nightreign, which debuted on the list at No. 1. Doom: The Dark Ages had a strong debut at No. 2 for Microsoft and Bethesda, with Forza Horizon 5, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 rounding out the top 5. These cross-platform releases on PS5 have apparently made a sizable impact. Microsoft's perennial best-seller, Minecraft, slipped to the seventh slot in May. The only other new additions to chart in May were EA's F1 25 at No. 15, and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 at No. 19. Most of the other titles have been placing in the top 20 for months, although Star Wars Battlefront 2 made a surprising leap from No.135 to No. 12 in just a single month as fans continue to make the case for Star Wars Battlefront 3.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

Title: Challenge of predicting Texas floods and SCOTUS allows for mass federal layoffs: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Meteorologists and forecasting experts say the severity of the deadly Texas floods couldn’t have been predicted. The Supreme Court allows Donald Trump to move forward with mass firings. And more pet owners are opting into insurance for their furry family members. Here’s what to know today. At least 161 people are missing after catastrophic floods tore through the Texas Hill Country, Gov. Greg Abbott said yesterday, as the desperate search for survivors continues. The death toll rose to at least 110 people. Meanwhile, scrutiny and questions are mounting about how and when people in the area received flash flood alerts. Among those questions: What actions were taken to notify residents? Were emergency alerts adequate, and who issued them? It was also unclear whether alerts were received on all phones. At a news conference yesterday, local officials and law enforcement in Kerr County couldn’t provide basic details of the emergency response. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. While National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding ahead of time, the best weather models could not have predicted precisely where the most intense rainfall would land, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin, meteorologists and forecasting experts said. Texas state climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon called such a prediction “next to impossible.” What did happen was that “all the ingredients came together at the wrong place, at the wrong time, at night on a holiday weekend,” said David Gagne, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. Though NOAA is working to build better weather models, that research is on the chopping block. As science reporter Evan Bush explains, a succession of thunderstorms fed by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry hit the region. Weather charts showed that the south fork of the Guadalupe River took a direct and prolonged hit. Then, instead of moving on, the storms stalled and dumped 10-12 inches of rain over six hours. Making matters worse, the area — consisting of steep hills and narrow canyons that rapidly funnel water from smaller creeks into swollen rivers — was filled with campers near the river’s edge. If the storm had been even five miles in another direction, it would not have produced as much destruction, Nilsen-Gammon said. Read the full story here. The Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump, at least temporarily, to move ahead with plans to impose mass firings of the federal workforce and reorganize various government agencies. The decision affects 19 federal agencies, as well as the White House-adjacent Office of Management and Budget, Office of Personnel Management and U.S. DOGE Service. The court’s decision yesterday was a response to a ruling from California-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who blocked Trump’s plans in May, saying that while the president can seek to make changes to the workforce, there are limits when they are done wholesale. The Trump administration, however, argued that the president does not need permission from Congress to carry out his duties as stated in the Constitution. The justices made clear that their order is not about the legality of any individual agency reduction in force or reorganization plan, only the legality of Trump’s executive order and an administration memo related to workforce plans. Ketanji Brown Jackson, the only justice to provide a written dissent, sharply criticized the decision as “hubristic and senseless.” Read the full story here. Small-town hospitals are buckling under strain from Trump’s sprawling domestic policy bill, signed into law last week. It includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and could result in millions of Americans losing health care coverage. The package includes $50 billion for rural hospitals, though it won’t be enough to offset the Medicaid and ACA cuts, one expert said. Now, hospitals are already considering how to adapt to a shifting budget, even if some of the Trump bill’s changes won’t take effect for a few years. Some smaller hospitals are already closing their doors due to growing financial strain. The Nebraska-based Community Hospital said last week that it’s shutting down its medical center in Curtis, a town of around 900 people. In Hugo, Colorado, Kevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital and Care Center, said he may soon have to start cutting services for patients at the 25-bed rural hospital. And in Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, said he’s evaluating how the only hospital for many residents of South Central Kansas will be able to keep offering all of its services, which include hospice and home care, women’s health and pediatric care. Read the full story here. My cat Macaroni is pretty unusual, and not only because he can whine loud enough to be heard two floors down or because he’s missing a back left paw — but because he’s insured. Most pet owners don’t buy coverage for their animals. Of the nearly 90 million dogs and almost 74 million cats in the U.S., both species’ insured rates remain in the single digits. But that’s changing fast, as business intern Evie Steele reports. Spending on pet insurance has grown by at least 20% each year since 2020, hitting more than $4.7 billion last year, according to one industry estimate. Evie found consumers have strong opinions on whether pet insurance is worth it — most policies don’t cover pre-existing conditions — but analysts broadly expect the market to keep growing. — Rich Bellis, senior business editor The discounts are just starting on the second day of Amazon Prime Day.

Title: Sweeping Layoffs Hit Tech And Media Giants Citing AI Take Over

ByMartine Paris ByMartine Paris, Contributor. Learning to work with AI. With AI being credited for doing half the work at Salesforce by CEO Marc Benioff, a growing number of companies have been firing teams in response to the rise in AI adoption. Here’s a running list of layoffs. Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos space venture, is axing 1,000 jobs, nearly 10% of its workforce, to restructure for automation. Bumble is laying off 30% of its team, about 240 people, to better compete with AI-powered dating apps like Hinge. Business Insider is cutting 21% of its team as it goes all-in on AI to respond to the decline in Google search traffic. Dropbox downsized by 20% at the end of last year in its transition to AI offerings. Google, whose AI summaries are accelerating the demise of search traffic, has offered early retirement to its Search, Ads and Commerce teams. IBM slashed nearly 9,000 jobs, mostly in human resources as AI agents automate administrative tasks. Intel plans to layoff up to 20% of its factory workers as it pivots to AI. The company had over 100,000 employees at the end of last year. JPMorganChase is expecting a 10% reduction in operations staff as the company tells managers to do more with less, lean into AI, and focus on efficiencies. Meta is cutting 4,000 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, while doubling down on AI, poaching talent from OpenAI and hiring former Github CEO Nat Friedman to co-head its new Super Intelligence Labs with Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang. Microsoft eliminated 15,000 jobs this year, nearly 7% of its workforce, despite strong earnings, with CEO Satya Nadella citing 20% to 30% of its code now being written by AI tools. Company-wide sales, marketing, product and engineering teams, gaming divisions including Xbox, and management layers across the board are getting slashed. Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI will wipe out half of all white collar jobs in the coming years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said AI could spike unemployment by 20%. Goldman Sachs is testing an AI full-stack engineer named Devin, from Khosla-backed Cognition, a startup estimated to be valued at $4-$5 billion, and Nvidia just became the first-ever $4 trillion company. Clearly, this is just the beginning. Companies announcing AI-first strategies, including Duolingo, Klarna and Shopify, have been met with sharp criticism for suggesting contractors could be replaced by AI. Others have been scrambling with messaging. Amazon, which just celebrated deploying its 1 millionth robot in fulfillment centers, told Fast Company that despite widely reported rumors, it did not put 14,000 positions on the chopping block. And although Block, formerly known as Square, is eliminating 1,000 jobs, about 8% of staff, its co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said the move is not to replace workers with AI. Despite mass layoffs, one engineer, Soham Parekh, managed not only to land several tech jobs, but work them simultaneously. He became a meme last week when his skill at beating the recruiting machine went viral. Amid the frenzy of posts were prominent AI investors Reid Hoffman and Mark Cuban. Box CEO Aaron Levie opined, “If Soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend.” Updated with Nvidia $4 billion market cap news and Goldman Sachs AI staffing.

Title: IROBOT ALERT: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Announces that a Class Action Lawsuit Has Been Filed Against iRobot Corporation and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

July 08, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: After Amazon's Hit Show, New Fallout Rumor Makes A Lot More Sense

Time Published: 2025-07-09T00:00:20Z

Although the franchise has always been an iconic pillar of the RPG genre, Amazon's Fallout show helped bring the series to a much wider audience of new viewers. Not only was the record-breaking series a hit with plenty of fans, but it also caused a massive spike in player counts for Bethesda's older Fallout games. Despite the show's significant success, Bethesda seemed somewhat unprepared to take advantage of the spike in popularity, which thankfully might be changing this second time around. While it will likely be a long wait until the highly anticipated Fallout 5 makes its appearance, official confirmation of a third season for Fallout means there won't be a content drought for too long. If its first season was anything to go by, the show's follow-ups are likely to be another smashing success for Amazon, which could have some significant benefits for Fallout players. Whether we'll be getting a look at the next entry in the series or some surprise projects, a recent report is a great sign of things to come. As reported by ComicBook, Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler made some significant claims regarding the future of the Fallout series after the recent layoffs at Xbox. As a guest on an episode of the Friends Per Second podcast, Middler claimed that "There are multiple Fallout projects in development," which he says includes "that one I'm sure you're all wanting". While the vague statements don't explicitly confirm any specific hopes for future Fallout content, it would honestly be more of a surprise if Bethesda didn't have more Fallout projects in the works. Although the vague rumor isn't too much to go on, the idea that we could see a new major release for the Fallout series following the second or third season of the Fallout show would be a more than welcome surprise. Even if Middler says that we're "not going to be playing this game anytime soon" regarding the biggest project from the studio, it's only a part of what's coming to the series in the future. Bethesda has confirmed the upcoming Fallout 5 won't be released until some time after the next Elder Scrolls game, so it's much more likely that the next big project for the series will be in the form of a remaster. Much like Bethesda's latest The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it's not hard to see a modern overhaul of Fallout New Vegas or the heavily rumored remake of Fallout 3 being a massive success for the studio. Even if Fallout 3 would be the more likely candidate given its in-house development at Bethesda, Fallout New Vegas is easily the more popular choice among fans, given its cult classic nature and significant ties to the show. Oblivion Remastered has been massively successful, and if a Fallout 3 remaster wants to achieve the same result, some changes will need to be made. While Bethesda may not be quite ready to announce a new sequel or even a remake by the time Fallout's second season rolls around, there's still plenty of room to take advantage of its popularity. Even mobile games like Fallout Shelter show just how much potential the series can have in other mediums, not to mention the Fallout 76 MMO still going strong years after release to show there's still plenty of love to be had for the Fallout franchise.

The best game of all time, according to Metacritic’s aggregated rankings, is overdue for a dethroning - but it probably won’t happen anytime soon. James Gunn's Superman perfectly sets up 2025's next DCU project in a few exciting ways, now that this brand-new universe has truly begun. Emmy-winning design expert Bobby Berk returns as host of HGTV’s new junk-flipping show, launching fresh content amid network’s recent cancellations. Boston Blue recasting the character of Sean Reagan shines a light on Danny's post-Blue Bloods life, & refocuses the principle theme of the franchise. Doctor Who's Ncuti Gatwa provides a shocking response about the 16th Doctor's casting following the divisive Billie Piper casting twist. The upcoming Hunger Games prequel, Sunrise on the Reaping, will see the return of one key aspect from the early installments with a new cast. The Dark Urge is a fantastic origin to choose in Baldur's Gate 3, but there's one companion character that provides an even better experience.

Title: David Ellison’s $8B Paramount Takeover Inches Forward as Drama Surrounds Deal

A second 90-day extension on Paramount Global’s proposed merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media was triggered yesterday (July 7), giving regulators, company executives and the Federal Communications Commission more time to finalize and agree on the deal’s terms. One key hurdle remains: the FCC’s approval to transfer CBS’s broadcast licenses to Skydance, which must come from a commission currently led by Trump-appointed Republican Brendan Carr. Importantly, any ongoing negotiations will now play out against what’s presumed to be a more favorable regulatory climate, following Paramount’s controversial $16 million settlement with President Trump announced last week.

You can opt out anytime. That legal clash with the President stemmed from Trump’s lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been unfairly edited. The settlement, which has drawn sharp scrutiny, is just the latest twist in what’s been perhaps Paramount’s most turbulent year in recent memory—a saga that’s seen the company shift from Redstone family control to the edge of a new era under David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. For decades, Paramount embodied everything old Hollywood stood for, from its air of glamour to its dynastic leadership. This is the studio that gave moviegoers The Godfather and Top Gun and TV audiences hits like Cheers and Frasier. But with a merger in motion to hand the reins to Skydance, Paramount is now poised to become something very different: a tech-forward brand working to reinvent itself in an industry that’s long since moved on from the old rules. Needless to say, the road to this moment hasn’t been smooth. If anything, the story of how Paramount got here reads less like a typical business evolution and more like one of Taylor Sheridan’s soapy dramas on Paramount+, this one featuring a media dynasty clinging to power as its empire is carved up by outsiders. The $16 million settlement with Trump wasn’t just about clearing a legal hurdle; it was also seen as a way to neutralize a potential political threat. Inside Paramount, there were real fears that Trump could use regulatory leverage to derail the Skydance merger. That concern now seems far from hypothetical. On July 3, Trump appeared to confirm the existence of a “side deal” with Ellison that’s worth between $32 million and $35 million. He was referencing what Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino first reported as a private commitment by Ellison to run PSAs supporting Trump-aligned causes. Paramount has denied any knowledge of such an arrangement, but Trump’s comments are likely to intensify worries about editorial independence within CBS News. “What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king,” said Jon Stewart, whose The Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central, during a recent appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Stewart added that he, too, is bracing for whatever comes next: “I’m in a spot where I can do [The Daily Show] on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.” South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whose series streams on both Comedy Central and Paramount+, took to social media to slam the merger’s fallout for their show. “This merger is a [expletive] and it’s [expletive] up South Park,” they wrote in a post circulating on Instagram, responding to a delayed premiere announcement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.” The wheels for much of this were set in motion back in late 2023, when Skydance first began exploring a merger with Paramount Global. At the time, cord-cutting was accelerating, streaming losses were mounting, and Wall Street had largely lost faith in Paramount’s long-term strategy. Then–CEO Bob Bakish was holding merger talks with several potential partners, including Warner Bros. Discovery. But it was Skydance’s interest that kicked everything into gear. From the start, the deal was complicated by one name: Redstone. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, owns the family firm that effectively holds the keys to the company. Any buyer had to make her whole first, setting the stage for months of boardroom drama, internal power struggles and shareholder confusion. Skydance’s original offer, roughly $2 billion in cash and stock, triggered immediate backlash. Investors balked at the terms. Paramount’s special committee stalled. And in April 2024, Bakish was pushed out reportedly over disagreement with Redstone. The deal collapsed, and rival bidders began circling. Redstone seemed open to anything—until she wasn’t. Then, in a quiet but dramatic reversal, the Skydance talks were revived. This time, the restructured deal offered shareholders a better payout and a more straightforward path forward. By July 2024, an agreement was finalized: Skydance would merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction, ending the Redstone family’s decades-long grip on the studio. For many, the Redstones were synonymous with Paramount. Sumner Redstone built a sprawling media empire with ruthless focus. His daughter Shari spent years defending that legacy. But in the end, not even she could hold off the tide. Streaming hadn’t delivered, ad revenue was shrinking, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon were outpacing Paramount at every turn. David Ellison has laid out a vision centered on A.I.-assisted production, a renewed focus on tentpole films and reshaping Paramount+ into a leaner, more viable streaming platform. Still, major hurdles remain. Layoffs have already impacted hundreds. And whether Skydance can actually pull off a successful integration—blending old-school Hollywood with a tech-forward playbook—is far from guaranteed. Ellison and his team will face pressure from all directions: investors, regulators, unions and the press. But at least for now, for the first time in years, Paramount’s future is beginning to take shape—even if it means letting go of everything it once was.

Title: Microsoft reportedly focusing on new Fallout games and remasters after Xbox Studios upheaval

Considering Fallout 76 debuted in 2018, fans of the post-apocalyptic RPG series are anxious for new quests. Although Bethesda has yet to confirm any release dates, rumors suggest that multiple games are in development. In the Friends Per Second podcast, Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle confirmed that Fallout 3 Remastered is still in the works. Fallout 5 is also planned, but may not arrive until 2030 or later. However, Middler also referenced a potential Fallout 2 remaster and New Vegas follow-up. Part of the broadcast centered on the recent turmoil in Xbox Game Studios. The loss of 9,000 Microsoft jobs impacted developers, leading to untimely deaths of titles like Perfect Dark. After the layoffs, Microsoft wants to focus on profitable Xbox titles and IPs, like Fallout. Fallout 3 Remastered may be one of the first projects that's ready for public consumption. It's believed that Obisidian Entertainment is partnering with Virtuous, who developed Oblivion Remastered. Still, initial leaks indicated a 2023 release date, and Bethesda hasn't provided an official update. When the title inevitably arrives, players can expect Unreal Engine 5 to power its revamped visuals. For fans who don't consider Fallout 76 a mainline game, it's been a decade since Fallout 4 arrived. Insiders don't anticipate Fallout 5 surfacing anytime soon. Sadly, Middler also doesn't see any evidence of rushed development. What's even more unclear is the timeline for other Xbox games hinted at in the podcast. Bethesda and Obsidian are considering various spinoffs and remasters. One project in particular could excite fans of the 2010 Fallout: New Vegas. For now, the TV show will have to tide supporters over until any new Fallout game is ready. The second season of the Amazon-produced series will premiere in December 2025.

Title: A.I. Drives Job Cuts Across Silicon Valley Giants: By the Numbers

Tech layoffs are nothing new in Silicon Valley, a region long shaped by boom-and-bust hiring cycles, speculative investment and shifting economic conditions. But in recent months, executives have offered a different explanation for job cuts: the rapid rise of A.I. So far in 2025, nearly 400 tech companies have announced layoffs, affecting close to 94,000 employees, according to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker. Many of these roles are expected to be replaced—directly or indirectly—by A.I.-driven efficiencies. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Salesforce, for example, cut 1,000 roles earlier this year, redirecting hiring toward sales roles focused on A.I.-powered products. CEO Marc Benioff said last month that A.I. currently handles 30 to 50 percent of the company’s work, reducing the need for roles in fields like software engineering and customer support. Despite the job cuts, Salesforce remains financially strong, reporting $9.8 billion in revenue for the February-April quarter, an 8 percent year-over-year increase. Microsoft, the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, has also made significant cuts in 2025. The company laid off around 9,000 employees in July, following a separate round of more than 6,000 in May. Software engineers have borne the brunt of these reductions. Though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to A.I., the technology’s growing role inside the company is undeniable. In April, CEO Satya Nadella disclosed that A.I. now writes about 30 percent of Microsoft’s code—a figure he expects to climb. Microsoft isn’t alone in its internal shift toward A.I. At Google, well over 30 percent of new code includes A.I. generated suggestions, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed earlier this year. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has described developing an A.I. agent with coding abilities comparable to a mid-level engineer as one of the company’s top goals for 2025. Startups across Silicon Valley are following suit, increasingly requiring A.I. fluency in hiring and day-to-day operations. In a March memo to staff, Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke wrote that A.I. use is now “a fundamental expectation,” adding that any team requesting additional headcount or resources must first prove that the task can’t be handled by A.I. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn echoed a similar stance the following month. He told employees that headcount increases would only be approved if teams demonstrate the need for human involvement over automation. A.I. proficiency, he added, will also play a bigger role in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo will stop using contractors for tasks that A.I. can complete. With 2025 only halfway through, A.I.-driven workforce changes are poised to continue. In a June memo, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out the company’s sweeping integration of A.I. across areas like shopping, AWS, and internal operations. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time,” he wrote, “but in the next few years, we expect this will reduce our corporate workforce as we gain efficiency from using A.I. extensively across the company.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Rumors are swirling that Jeff Bezos might acquire Condé Nast, Vogue's parent company, as a wedding gift for Lauren Sanchez. This speculation is fueled by Sanchez's recent Vogue cover, hand-picked attire by Anna Wintour, and Wintour's departure as Editor-in-Chief. Insiders suggest Wintour may be brokering the deal, potentially benefiting from her equity in the company, despite denials from Bezos's camp.
