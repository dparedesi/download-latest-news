Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it was eliminating 14,000 management positions because artificial intelligence (AI) tools had rendered those middle-management roles redundant. Amazon isn’t the only one—Microsoft, Google and IBM have all announced AI-related layoffs. According to a 2023 report by Niti Aayog, 1.5 million Indian jobs in the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors alone are expected to be at high risk by 2031. McKinsey believes that as many as 69% of tasks in India’s IT services industry can already be automated with existing AI technology, suggesting that as many as 3-4 million jobs in the IT and BPO sectors could be at risk in the near to medium term. Our instinctive response has been to try to catch up—to build AI capabilities so that we can replace the jobs being lost by upskilling displaced workers with the technology that displaced them. We have announced AI education initiatives, established new AI research centres and funded GPU clusters and data centres that we believe these newly trained engineers will be able to use for building AI applications. But this strategy is unlikely to be effective. Firstly, India will not be able to bridge the skills gap by simply retraining its existing workforce. Unlike the IT industry, which has a broad base, AI has an inverted pyramid and is staffed in exactly the opposite way that a BPO centre is staffed. As a result, even if we manage to reskill all those in the traditional IT industry, only a small fraction of those reskilled IT workers will be needed going forward. What’s more, unlike the US, which boasts of 30 years of AI research infrastructure and top universities that attract global talent, and China, which is investing billions in AI research and already has a massive pool of strong STEM graduates, India currently produces fewer than 500 AI PhDs annually. Even if we increase this 10-fold, we will still be playing catch-up in a field where first-mover advantages matter enormously. The trouble with competing in the race to build better AI models is that it requires us to compete upstream in the AI value chain in a market already crowded by players with significantly more capital and hardware infrastructure, which places them ahead in the game. As noble as it might seem for us to fight the good fight, there are other areas in which Indian investments in time and resources are likely to yield better results. When the automobile disrupted traditional urban mobility and transport dynamics, the real opportunity was not in making cars, but in the novel ways in which they could be used for business and the new liberties that arose from being able to use these machines for things that were not possible earlier. When Apple invented the smartphone, it did not just create a revolutionary communication device, but also made it possible for brand new businesses (such as ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments) to emerge. Every technological transformation creates ripples of opportunity downstream that offer new avenues for entrepreneurship. This suggests that the AI opportunity lies not in competing with big AI labs to build better models, but rather in discovering all the various ways in which AI can be deployed to create value. This, in turn, suggests that instead of competing with countries that are at the cutting edge of developing new foundational AI models, India may be far better off figuring out how to use AI to do things that would not have been possible previously. One of the clearest signs of this downstream potential is how dramatically AI has already lowered barriers to creative endeavours. Already, to write a story or create an image, a musical composition or a software feature, all you need to do is describe what you want and AI will execute it. Even just a few years ago, filmmaking required large crews, expensive equipment and a budget that ran into millions. AI has made it possible to create visual effects, voice actors and music scores, with film editing done and other technical skills deployed at a fraction of that cost. Similarly, music production used to require studio recording, mixing and mastering skills. Today, with AI, almost anyone can generate a score, create vocal effects and mix tracks. Just as the world saw in the case of every other technological transformation that created new jobs and industries downstream of the actual disruption it caused, AI too will birth business opportunities that are not even conceivable today. If we really want to address the disruptions that AI will cause in the job market, we should focus our energies on enabling as many of our people as possible to figure out how to use AI and do all we can to make it possible for our young entrepreneurs to leverage this new technology in as many new and interesting ways as they can imagine. The next three to five years will be a period of intense experimentation, when AI-assisted business models will be tested, refined and scaled. India’s entrepreneurs have a rare early-mover advantage—not in building the models themselves, but in discovering what those models make possible. If we invest our energy downstream, in imagining the new possibilities that are opening up, we will be able to harness the real opportunity that AI offers. Our best response to the AI revolution is not to build better intelligence, but discover the many ways in which it can be put to use. India needs to make the most of this opportunity.

Title: Nvidia CEO told employees to use AI for 'every task that is possible' and says there will still be plenty of jobs

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?" Huang said he strongly disapproved. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do." Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday. Have a tip?

Title: Gen Z Redefines Work as Flexible Pay Gains Ground

With inflation and changing government policies prompting widespread uncertainty, 6 in 10 American workers are facing pocketbook challenges while lacking the steadiness and predictability of a salaried job.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ The latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series, breaks down how consumers earn income. The study is based on a census-balanced survey of 2,117 U.S. adult consumers, 62% are employed. Among those workers, 43% say their primary source of income is an hourly wage, and another 15% say it is from other non-salaried pay models such as gig work or contract fees. Gen Z workers especially are working outside of fixed-salary roles. Nearly 3 in 4 get their income in other ways, with 51% earning hourly wages, 9% earning contract or consulting fees, 7% earning income from gig or platform work and 5% earning commission-based pay. More Americans are relying on part-time jobs to make ends meet. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employees working full-time dropped by 0.5%, or 695,000 people, between 2023 and 2024. The number of part-time workers jumped 3.7%, or just over 1 million people, during the same period. Relatedly, the rise in gig work can be seen in the expansion of major platforms catering to independent contractors and freelancers. In the third quarter of 2025, Uber said it had 9.4 million drivers, up from 7.8 million the year before and 7.4 million in the second quarter of last year. DoorDash grew total orders by 21% year over year in Q3 to 776 million. Lyft reported record-high gross bookings of $4.8 billion in the third quarter, a 16% year-on-year spike. Even companies outside the dedicated gig platform space, such as UPS, are using the gig model. But as more consumers rely on hourly, project-based and gig work to make ends meet, rather than the stability of a fixed salary, they may find it harder to weather an uncertain economic environment. Because of the Trump administration’s global “reciprocal” tariffs regime, Americans face the highest import levies in 90 years. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Recent PYMNTS data shows confidence slipping, especially among lower-income workers. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, often described as a pessimist, sees the threat of a U.S. recession continuing to loom as the new year approaches. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including 42% who see their money fly out the door the month it comes in, an 18% jump since August. It is not as if these workers can simply leave their jobs for more steady, reliable work, with the number of job openings unchanged at 7.2 million in August. What’s more, many of the skilled jobs that often come with fixed salaries are shrinking. While economists are sharply divided over the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs, some recent research suggests that white collar roles — those traditional salaried positions — will be most impacted. While some businesses tout how AI will enable them to introduce operational efficiencies and reduce their workforces, companies also downsize for reasons not related to the technology. October saw a 175% year-over-year increase in layoffs, with Amazon planning to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs and Target slashing its corporate roles by 1,800. Workers have been nervous about these reductions for some time. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey last year found that 58% of consumers believed generative AI posed a risk to high-skilled jobs in tech. More than half deemed it a risk to mainstream office-based occupations, and 52% said it jeopardized roles for qualified education workers. As go changes in the labor market, so go spending and consumption patterns, deepening the connection between income instability and personal financial well-being. To get a clearer picture of how consumers are earning their income, read the full report, Income Instability Is Redefining the Paycheck-to-Paycheck Economy.

Unprecedented stress is hitting the US labor market for college graduates, who now represent a record 25.3% of the unemployed. Recent data shows over 1.9 million degree holders are jobless, with their unemployment rate climbing to 2.8%. This surge, particularly impacting younger workers, signals a significant slowdown in white-collar hiring, potentially driven by AI and automation.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Pragmatism, not idealism, will determine the fate of Google’s ad tech empire

More from the series → After months of testimony and a final day of unusually pointed questioning, Judge Leonie Brinkema used the closing arguments phase of the U.S. Department of Justice v. Google to give the clearest indication yet of how she is weighing up an appropriate remedy after ruling the defendant a monopolist earlier this year. After Friday’s proceedings, she has now retired to her chambers to mull over a decision over the coming weeks, but for many, a complete divestiture of Google’s ad exchange or ad server (i.e., the entity formerly known as DoubleClick For Publishers within Google Ad Manager) appears increasingly unlikely. During closing arguments, the judge repeatedly steered the discussion away from theory and toward hard practicalities, indicating that pragmatism, more than pure ideals, will (likely) drive the final outcome. This is because Brinkema’s questions consistently pressed the DOJ on implementation timelines, commercial feasibility, and the (what many courtroom attendees perceived as) a lack of concrete detail in its structural remedy plan. “Time is of the essence,” she said at one point, citing the rapid pace of technological change in advertising and AI. Any remedy, she stressed, must be “concrete” and must account for the “commercial reality” of execution. That framing dominated the morning. While DOJ attorney Matthew Huppert reiterated the government’s preference for a structural remedy — divesting AdX, open-sourcing auction logic, or potentially forcing a sale of GAM — he conceded DOJ was “not dogmatic about the details.” But when pressed on specifics, including whether a structural remedy could be implemented during an inevitable appeal, the DOJ offered little. Judge Brinkema, noted that behavioral remedies “could go forward whether there is an appeal pending or not,.” She added, “[Divestiture] is a dramatic change,… [it] would most likely not be as easily enforceable while an appeal was pending.” Google’s Karen Dunn capitalized on that hesitation. Dunn argued the DOJ “did not meet the heavy burden required for a divestiture,” arguing that witnesses for the defense asserted that Google’s proposed remedies would address their concerns. She further outlined Google’s opinion that the DOJ failed to prove behavioral remedies were insufficient; that a technically and commercially workable buyer existed; and that divestiture would restore competition or avoid harms to consumers. During rebuttal, DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood conceded that a buyer has not been identified –although Digiday sources have relayed how loose-lipped attendees at this year’s Advertising Week New York voiced their intentions to take a look at the DFP – while the defendant argued a sale would be “messy, risky and long, with no guarantee of success.” What the ruling will likely look like Taken together, Brinkema’s questions point to a strong likelihood that she will opt against ordering a divestiture — at least not immediately. Her emphasis on timelines, enforceability during appeal, technical feasibility and the need to avoid abstract reasoning suggests she is leaning toward a behavioral-first remedy, potentially supplemented with guardrails or phased requirements. A ruling is expected “likely next year,” she said — most likely in Q1 or Q2 of 2026, based on her remarks. Settlement? Appeal? Hw long will this drag on? Brinkema remarked that she “could see a settlement” that makes sense, though she acknowledged the widening gap between the parties and the existence of “looming settlements” in other ad-tech cases. Realistically, the chance of an agreed resolution appears low. An appeal, however, appears inevitable. Google has signaled as much, and Brinkema repeatedly referenced the complications of crafting remedies that must survive scrutiny. A full appellate cycle could take 18–30 months, pushing any structural remedy (if ordered) well into 2028. In other words, the case may be nearing its first final judgment, but the industry is only entering the next chapter. “We’re entering an odd moment in AI where a huge number of “AI companies” are basically wrappers on top of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or open models like Mistral and Qwen. They don’t own the tech, the data, or the infrastructure — yet they’re being valued as if they do.” – One Digiday source casts a healthy dose of cynicism among the AI hype-cycle Sources suggest Amazon’s latest round of mass layoffs cut headcount in its advertising division by up to 20%, though staff there are paid through the last week of January, making it difficult to establish exact numbers. A new pitch deck making the rounds at agencies drives that point home. Google boss Sunar Pichai warns ‘no company immune’ to AI bubble bursts The most powerful chief executive in the industry says the quiet part out loud. The EU considers cracking down on Big Tech’s cloud power Cloud infrastructure is increasingly part of the consideration of advertisers and their supply chain, and that’s not lost on regulators. Advertisers see now value in news, but Google knows society will pay Richard Gingras, Google’s longtime news policy lead, he continues to push back on the Google-owned web argument, in conversation with Ricky Sutton and Alan Chapell. Yahoo is testing 6 AI agents for advertising, leaked slides show Yahoo hopes to capitalize weariness over Google’s market leadership and the escalating standoff between Amazon and The Trade Desk to further its marketshare of its demand-side platform. Agencies, ad-tech companies and publishers are racing to test AI media agents. Not all those tests are successful — even some that are. The e-commerce giant has quietly blocked more OpenAI-related bots from crawling Amazon.com, according to updates in its publicly visible robots.txt file.

Update font size. Reset Apple is cutting dozens of enterprise sales positions as part of a restructuring aimed at simplifying how it sells to businesses, schools, and government clients. The eliminated roles include account managers and staff who ran Apple’s dedicated briefing centers used for institutional meetings and product demos. A company spokesperson confirmed the changes, saying the move will allow Apple to reach more customers, and that impacted employees are eligible to apply for other open positions inside the company. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ Apple confirmed on Monday that it’s reshuffling the division, without giving specifics. “To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles,” a spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. “We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.” It’s unusual for Apple to make cuts across an organization, and the layoffs came as a surprise to those affected. The move is especially notable because revenue has been growing at the fastest clip in years. Apple is on track to generate sales of nearly $140 billion in the December quarter, smashing its previous record. Employees who lost their jobs have until Jan. 20 to secure another position within the company or they’ll be terminated with a severance package. Apple is advertising sales roles on its jobs website and told laid-off workers they could apply for them. Internally, the company is positioning the layoffs as part of an effort to streamline its sales workforce and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. But some of the affected workers said the move was driven by an effort to shift more sales to third-party resellers, which the company refers to as the channel. Some organizations prefer to work with those indirect sellers, they said, and the change helps Apple lower internal costs like salaries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: When a company decides a different go-to-market model will be more efficient or scalable, certain positions can become superfluous. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Epic CEO: "RAM price increases will be a real problem" — as OpenAI et al. blow up RAM prices, threatening affordability of everything from Xbox to TVs and laptops

The AI fad is destroying the affordability of RAM, as demand from OpenAI, Google, and others blow up prices. Why is this happening? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Gamers can't seem to catch a break, although this latest goldrush is going to impact far more than just gamers this time around. After years of dealing with the crypto craze blowing up GPU prices, the artificial intelligence fad being pushed by companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others, is now having a serious impact on the affordability and scarcity of RAM. For those who don't know, RAM (random access memory) is used as temporary memory storage used to store and access data on a short-term basis. Simplified, you can think of it as your computer's short-term memory, and is designed for on-demand rapidity so apps and games can run instantly. You can find it in basically any "smart" device, from TVs to phones to laptops, to Xbox consoles and gaming PCs. In just a few weeks, the general price of consumer-grade DDR5 RAM has increased in some cases by as much as 110%, with products like Micron's Crucial Pro 32GB DDR5 kit effectively doubling in price in the space of a month. And things might only get worse. Speaking on X, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney described the scale of the problem, as government-backed companies like OpenAI outbid consumer manufacturers on RAM fabrication priorities. RAM price increases will be a real problem for high-end gaming for several years. Factories are diverting leading edge DRAM capacity to meet AI needs where data centers are bidding far higher than consumer device makers. https://t.co/VgO2OG4oOrNovember 24, 2025 Indeed, companies like OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others are striking massive deals with RAM manufacturers such as Samsung and SK Hynix to supply their data centers. Artificial intelligence is the tech fad du jour, with governments and shareholders seemingly convinced that the technology is critical for national security (and also lowering firm's costs by offloading tasks to clankers robots instead of humans). True or not, it's the main driving force behind these price increases. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. OpenAI and others are being given massive loans and subsidies (often paid for by taxpayers) and require absolutely enormous quantities of electricity, processing, and also memory capacity. Backed by nation states and the full force of Wall Street hype, manufacturers of consumer-grade goods like laptops, video game consoles, and TVs typically already endure thin margins — they cannot outbid the likes of OpenAI on data center component purchasing. Some manufacturers have stockpiled RAM specifically to avoid price increases on their products in the interim to try and weather the storm. There were some rumors that Xbox Series X|S consoles, which have recently endured price increases, would be rapidly exposed to further increases as a result of this. Sources tell me that Microsoft does have a healthy supply of Xbox, Surface, and other RAM-using stock for the time being. But of course, those stocks will not last forever — for any manufacturer. Indeed, the current wave of AI hype doesn't seem likely it will die down any time soon. Once any existing consumer tech supplies dwindle for any manufacturer, products like Xbox and PlayStation consoles, television sets, laptops, and more, could start to see serious price increases over time. The volatility between AI demand and tariffs is why we didn't get the Xbox Ally prices until the very last minute, and why we still don't have the Steam Machine prices either. Things are just generally crazy right now, to use industry terms. The first to feel the pinch will be anyone who is buying RAM standalone to upgrade their PCs or existing laptops. The world only has so much capacity to produce RAM, meaning demand will likely exceed supply for the foreseeable. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron control some 90% of the market together. Consumer tech manufacturers will bid for chips from these companies directly for their own products. And given the out-sized purchasing power from companies like OpenAI, flooded with investor cash, us peasants will have to endure the scraps for the time being. It's just another thing for the pile of reasons to hate this big AI fad — destroyed livelihoods, greenhouse gasses, electricity prices, layoffs, stolen water supplies, toxic chemicals, turbo-charged false information industry, mental health degradation, and now rapidly ballooning consumer goods prices.

Title: A few hundred employees working on "self-directed projects" has made Valve one of the world's most profitable-per-person companies, on track to top $17 billion this year and shame the likes of Google and Meta

You get a yacht, and you get a yacht When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Analyst estimates of Valve's annual revenue is already around 6% higher than the whole of 2024, meaning it is on track to surpass $17 billion by the end of the year. While this number is already staggering, it is even more impressive in context of how many people the company employs, with likely less than 400 staff members working at the gaming giant. Steam's owner Valve is one of the few independent gaming companies of its size, and this means that despite how much money it makes, it's able to hold its cards close to its chest. This is where analysts help us out, with Alinea Analytics estimating that the company has already earned more than $16.3 billion in the first 11 months of this year. Steam has generated $16B+ in revenue so far this year (@alineaanalytics estimates)That's already up 5.7% from 2024's final total!Taking Valve's cuts into account (and 100% cuts of its own juggernauts CS2 and Dota 2), Valve itself has made over $4B+ this year from Steam. pic.twitter.com/PlMCjDEEgDNovember 13, 2025 Despite Valve's momentous revenue, it only has a few hundred employees. The last time employee information was made public was in 2024, when court documents from 2021 that weren't properly redacted were discovered. As reported by The Verge, the company claimed to have just 336 employees on the payroll, but has likely expanded due to the launch of the Steam Deck. Working with estimates, Valve likely earns $40 - 50 million per employee, blowing companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft out of the water. The Xbox parent company makes the most of the three (I'm sure in no small part due to its history of mass layoffs), but it isn't even close to big daddy Valve at just $18 million per staff member. Valve has been aware that it's on to a winning formula since at least 2012 when it wrote some industry-standard-breaking statements in its still available employee handbook. Not only does the book inform employees that "100%" of their work will be "self-directed projects", but that their pay will be directly correlated with what they produce. "Valve pays people very well compared to industry norms," the book states. "Our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft, and we believe strongly that the right thing to do in that case is to put a maximum amount of money back into each employee’s pocket. Valve does not win if you’re paid less than the value you create. And people who work here ultimately don’t win if they get paid more than the value they create." While this last statement looks like a way of paying Valve staff less than desireably, the above mentioned court documents showed that the average Valve employee earned $1.3 million per year back in 2021. Might not be the $50 million that Valve is raking in per person, but Gabe Newell needs to buy his yachts somehow, eh? Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Steam Machine price "more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," confirms Valve – but "ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal."

Title: Jeff Bezos' Grim US Economy Prediction Is Coming True
URL: https://www.moneydigest.com/2034736/jeff-bezos-grim-us-economy-prediction-coming-true/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T17:00:00Z

It's hard to turn around without encountering a grim financial prediction these days, and many well-known figures in the finance sphere have had something to say about it. Between the budgetary impact tariffs have on families, the rising cost of groceries, and a higher cost of living for most Americans, even some of the wealthiest people in the country are feeling uneasy. While the economy may not ever be grinding too hard on Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, that doesn't change the fact that he made a grim economic prediction that is now coming true. In a 2023 interview with CNN, Bezos warned, "The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy." While this observation may not have predicted the sweeping job losses due to 2025's DOGE job and budget cuts, the labor market has hit a brick wall. Per analysis by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, hiring frequency is the lowest it's been in 14 years. The company's November 2025 reporting stated the United States had cut more than 1 million jobs by October 2025, the highest layoff total since the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in 2020. However, Bezos' fortune-telling didn't stop there. Bezos warned consumers and small business owners to "play the probabilities" by cutting big spending. He suggested it might be preferable to have some cash reserves, rather than new gear or appliances, if things get even worse — advice that still rings darkly true in 2025. Bezos did not predict economic recession, but his interview confirms the complex nature of what was to come. Even so, in his CNN interview, he clearly pushed risk aversion across the board, saying, "Try to reduce some risk in your business or your life." Bezos floats near the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and despite being one of the richest men in the world, the advice he gave feels applicable to people in many economic classes. For business owners, Bezos warned, "Maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it could wait a little bit," before going on to say that even small precautions like that delay could be what keeps a business afloat amid economic turmoil. Investors in the market have seen wild volatility in 2025, making Bezos' words seem relevant to pretty much all financial sectors. However, the market bursts as much as it sags, and both small and large investments could have significant weight on many individuals' financial situations. Bezos's suggestion that small business owners avoid risky business also goes against much of what he's done to build his own empire. Bezos is obsessed with taking risks, and he's preoccupied with absorbing competition. In fact, part of why Amazon is so massive is the amount of investment the company made in taking over so many competitors in its path. Americans spend a ton on Amazon every month, so listening to Bezos' business advice might make sense. However, he founded Amazon out of a garage, as a bookselling operation. He's now backing an AI company to program proteins. That doesn't happen without risk. Bezos has been accused of underpaying workers, sneakily underpaying himself, and doing everything to avoid taxes. It takes more than greed and avarice to succeed, but a close look at Bezos's early history shows a degree of strategy beyond using brutish amounts of cash to buy up everything around him. "Take as much risk off the table as you can for yourself," Bezos insisted at the end of his CNN interview. Frugality and austerity may work for surviving the toughest of economic times, but no one knows an individual business better than the owner. Penny pinching too heavily can be the reason a small business fails, rather than thrives. Not purchasing a desperately needed new appliance like a fridge could mean a lot of food and energy goes to waste, and money would go along with it. Everyone must try to best weigh their own economic decisions with their own reality. For some, it might work out to follow some of Bezos' actions rather than his words. After all, if you invested in Amazon 20 years ago, you would be very wealthy now.

Title: Big pay, bigger influence: How Wall Street's war for AI talent is shaping new power dynamics

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The hottest job on Wall Street right now isn't a trader or dealmaker. It belongs to the human minds who specialize in building the digital ones. Bank chiefs have been touting how adopting artificial intelligence at scale will help employees work smarter and cut costs, and they're putting serious money behind those AI ambitions. Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon said in October that he wished the firm's $6 billion annual tech budget was even higher, while Bank of America dedicated $4 billion this year to "new technology initiatives," according to the company. A chunk of that investment is directed at building out battalions of tech professionals to realize those strategies. However, the demand for that talent is driving salaries for technologists who specialize in AI — from rank-and-file engineers to executive and C-suite tech strategists — to soar at banks, according to insiders. "There's certainly not enough people" to keep pace with hiring demand, said recruiter Ryan Bulkoski, the global head of the AI, data, and analytics practice at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles. Recruiters and executives across financial services companies told Business Insider the result is a full-blown talent war pitting Wall Street banks against hedge funds, private asset managers, and Silicon Valley startups. The senior-level or C-suite AI leader who can steer corporate strategy "is the hottest job in the market" right now, forcing financial services firms to cough up "stretch offers," Chris Connors, a principal at the compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, told Business Insider. "If you are a high-caliber talent, you are more desirable than virtually every other role in the market," Connors added, noting that some firms have extended special, non-standard awards to lure top-tier talent or prevent them from leaving. Competition across the industry is fierce, as hedge funds and other asset managers have even issued incremental equity or long-term awards, Connors said — they often range from $500,000 to $1 million, typically vesting across three to four years. Some firms have offered "significant upfront sign-on grants," often in excess of $200,000, delivered off the bat as cash or equity, he said. For banks, especially, it has created a conundrum — how to extend big-ticket offers while adhering to their often rigid, standardized compensation bands. Hiring managers are forking over "some uncomfortable hiring packages" which are vaulting recipients into "a completely different stratosphere," Bulkoski explained, noting that top compensation packages for senior-level AI leaders are reaching the high seven- and even eight-figure range. "Nobody's leaving for less than 30%" pay increases if they're coming from companies where they're already "heads-down and doing well," he said. "No one's going to move for the historical 10, 15, or even 20% bump in compensation." AI hiring in the financial services industry grew in 2025 to 10 times its level at the start of January 2022, according to an analysis by workforce data provider Revelio Labs. To assemble the data, Revelio examined finance job postings for roles like "AI engineer," "machine learning engineer," and "computer vision engineer," among others. Six of the largest US banks — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley — have collectively posted more than 2,000 AI roles in the past 12 months, Revelio's data showed. That surging demand for AI talent is driving paychecks higher. The average salary for AI professionals in finance, excluding C-suite roles, had risen to about $180,000 from $142,000 in 2020. That increase of more than 25% puts them on par with what conventional tech firms tend to pay for these roles, Revelio said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment. "What we have seen with banks over the past few years is they've had to really reframe and reimagine those comp ranges, especially for a lot of this type of talent," Ben Hodzic, head of North America at the recruiting firm Selby Jennings, told Business Insider. That's especially true as they're coming up against multistrategy hedge funds and high-frequency systematic trading firms that are "paying whatever they need to pay to get people," he said. But money alone isn't enough, insiders said. These technologists also want something else: power. Insiders said the AI race has elevated the voices of technology chiefs at banks and asset managers, giving them a perch at powerful tables that steer firms' overall strategy. Bulkoski said that, for prospective AI chiefs, wielding greater levels of influence in the boardroom alongside other C-suite leaders is an appealing prospect unto itself. "It could trump another number on the sheet," he said. The nature of the work is attracting a broad swathe of professionals eager to exploit the breach. "Go on LinkedIn and look at the number of people who just changed their title from data scientist to AI scientist," Bulkoski said. "It's kind of unbelievable." Candidates for senior-level roles are skewing younger, he continued. Some AI-savvy talent in their early- to mid-20s are pulling high-six to seven-figure offers, he said. To suss out who is a fit and who isn't, Bulkoski said his team assesses "whether they have a real track record" of constructing original AI or machine learning products at scale, and if they can channel that knowledge into creating commercial or operational value. "Most are in the early phases of developing executive maturity," he said, "but the best of them can already influence senior leaders by grounding every conversation in architecture, data, and measurable impact." With access to the board and stepped-up influence and responsibility, some Wall Street insiders are betting they can offer something Big Tech companies generally can't: a steadier, more clearly defined climb up the professional ranks. With tech firms consolidating and fears of an AI bubble mounting, recruiters say some technologists are increasingly drawn to the stability and hierarchy that the financial services industry is known for. "There's been a lot less volatility with jobs in the finance industry compared to the tech industry," said Selby Jennings' Hodzic, adding that finance offers a more well-worn, clearly defined pathway. He said Wall Street had been insulated from the kind of mass layoffs that have roiled Big Tech. Amazon, for instance, cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025. Recruiters say the flames fanning the talent war aren't dissipating anytime soon, and that the next phase of the hiring race is already underway. "In 2025, it's almost like Gen AI is in the past," Bulkoski said. "We're actually now working on searches that have 'agentic AI' in the title." Jump to

Title: 'Entitled,' 'complacent,' and 'sloppy': Inside the workplace tension at the world's largest HR organization

On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. The brief performance, which took place in a conference room with about 75 employees, came after remarks honoring the 24th anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. SHRM has been embroiled in controversy in recent years. Some of these challenges have gripped workplaces across the country, including regular layoffs and restructurings and debates over DEI. Other elements, however, set SHRM apart. They include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a "conservative" dress code that referenced "enclothed cognition" and bans sequins; an employment discrimination lawsuit set to go to trial in December; and a company-wide meeting in which CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr. said some staffers were "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Revenue grew from $131 million in 2017 to $233 million last year, according to public tax filings. It has 413 employees today, up from 387 in December 2017. This article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former SHRM employees and nearly a dozen current and former members, as well as legal and tax filings and government records. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. SHRM was founded in 1948 and today describes itself as "the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces." Former staffers characterized it as a punitive workplace. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. A memo sent to SHRM's brand and marketing staff in January laid out a dress code that included a lengthy introduction about "enclothed cognition," a term that refers to the notion that the clothing workers wear impacts their performance. The code required staff to dress in "conservative" business attire and prohibited items such as sneakers, denim, skorts, sequins, hats, and clothing that doesn't cover the area between the shoulders and knees. Burke said "SHRM offers employees the flexibility to arrive between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." and noted that the workplace is remote Mondays and Fridays. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "Literally, I've not told anyone, because I've been trying to figure out where I was going to land, and I've landed on a decision," Taylor said. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. There will be a total reorg … And this is not a decision that I've made again with anyone, no one." His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. SHRM cut staff earlier this month. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." In his statement, Taylor said November's "organizational redesign is about shifting for the future, not reacting to the past," adding that the cuts were not due to financial strain and that the organization has an "enviable balance sheet." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. In some cases, full teams were let go. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." "That's on us — and we've corrected it. We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. Repeated layoffs can be a sign of poor leadership, said Herd, the former head of HR for North America at McKinsey. SHRM is "literally describing themselves as experts in all things work and selling best practices in talent planning. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. It rings hollow to put the blame ostensibly on the people you chose to hire." "Whether they like it or not, they are held to a higher standard because they've put themselves out there as the preeminent expert on work." "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Daniel Burchfield, who joined SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation in 2024, said performance issues were cited in his February termination. But he said he hadn't been reprimanded or put on a performance improvement plan. "Nothing negative was indicated to me," he said. Two weeks before his termination, Burchfield said he told his manager he was worried about layoffs. He said the manager replied that SHRM likes to maintain an atmosphere of fear to drive performance. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." SHRM itself has said as much. "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. "They do the opposite of what they preach." Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. Last year, a judge called the case "messy" and said the evidence showed that the same HR person tasked with investigating Mohamed's complaints was also ghostwriting emails for Mohamed's boss and drafting Mohamed's termination paperwork around the same time. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. We know the facts, and we trust the process." Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. Workplace-discrimination lawsuits rarely get this far, he said. Further, SHRM didn't bring an independent investigator to oversee its internal probe into the matter, the court found. This is "far from best practices," Fray-Witzer said. In response to questions from Mohamed's lawyers, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, SHRM made DEI a focus of its educational materials. In 2021, a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by SHRM concluded that company leaders should make DEI a strategic priority. It said that DEI is not only "the right thing to do," but research shows DEI leaders outperform their competitors financially. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. SHRM spent $1 million to $2 million annually on lobbying in recent years, US Senate filings show. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the American Heart Association was "a valued member" and said SHRM looks "forward to continuing to explore ways of working with them in the future." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. Starbuck has repeatedly called DEI "poison." At the event, he said he believes "equity" is a "Marxist concept." "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "They claim this is a free exchange of ideas and they're just trying to bring different opinions," she said. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Not all SHRM members opposed Starbuck's participation. Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. He said he believed HR leaders need to understand the full corporate landscape, even when it might be uncomfortable. In a statement to Business Insider, Starbuck said he spent two hours taking photos with conference attendees after he finished speaking. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. Membership revenue increased in 2024, from $69 million to $75.6 million, according to its tax filings. Figures for 2025 aren't yet available. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor's total compensation has also grown. He received $4 million last year, more than five times what he made in 2018 and a 48% increase from what he was paid in 2022. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. The fund said Smith had been insubordinate. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. The student wrote that his acceptance was rescinded because of his hairstyle and called the policy "discriminatory, sexist, and contrary to TMCF's mission of supporting" students from historically Black colleges and universities. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times. Kinsey said the group's treatment of its workers shows "hypocrisy," while Schmidt compared his work at SHRM to "the marketing department for the Death Star." "I highly encourage you to never give a dollar to this organization," Schmidt said in one video. It was filmed in SHRM's offices. Have a tip? Know more? Reach Sarah E.

Title: I was laid off by Meta and became a boomerang employee 3 years later. Here's why I decided to return.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Devang Sharma, a 27-year-old senior software engineer at Meta, based in Menlo Park, CA. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The first time I joined Meta was in 2022. I uprooted my life in London and moved to Toronto to work there. I stayed for around four and a half months before being laid off. Meta is an amazing organization, one I saw myself retiring at, but there was nothing I could do to keep my job. Three years later, a recruiter from Meta reached out to me, and I had the chance to rejoin the company in a much more senior role. I had offers from other AI companies, but returning to Meta felt like a homecoming. With the direction of the industry, there's always a chance of layoffs; however, I saw coming back as a trade-off. I was working at a startup as an engineer before I applied for the Meta software engineering position in Toronto. When I was impacted by company layoffs, it was really challenging to deal with, especially as an immigrant. It was the middle of winter, and I had just left everything I knew behind in London. But I was still grateful for the first experience I had working at such a large scale. I was not dependent on Meta for my immigration status because I got my permanent residency, so I was free to switch jobs. Within a month, I secured several offers and landed a new role. There are LinkedIn groups, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and email newsletters for former Meta employees. I was always in touch with the former and current employees I worked with, as well as those I had not worked with directly. The conversations were mostly regarding what's happening across the industry and also within Meta. With the recent movements and investments in AI, a lot has changed over the past two and a half to three years. Meta has an internal system that tracks and enables them to reach out to current and former employees. A Meta recruiter emailed me about a specific role and team, and when I got more details about the position, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for. The interviews were similar to my first time interviewing with them in terms of coding standards and system design, but more complex in terms of tangible design problems. I was in the interview process with other organizations and considering their offers. This made me sort of unsure whether to proceed with Meta. Before rejoining Meta, I was working at Amazon. Although I had the opportunity to work with some great AI models, I was not directly contributing to the foundational models or writing the models myself. My role was primarily focused on implementing and fine-tuning. When I discovered that I could contribute to the domain of artificial intelligence firsthand by building and writing models, not just on the implementation side, which perfectly aligned with what I was looking for, I was thrilled. I'm in my 20s and I don't have a family. I'm pretty flexible in terms of my responsibilities. I couldn't sit back and be fearful about what would happen if there were more layoffs. There will probably be some, but I can't control it. I would've regretted not taking a chance to work on something amazing, simply because I chose a safe route. I had such a mixture of emotions going into my new hire orientation, this time at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park. It brought back all the memories of my first time joining the company back in Toronto. I knew that employees who worked at headquarters got to meet people like Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Meta, and other C-suite executives. Back in 2022, at the Toronto office, we were just watching them on video. In 2025, I was sitting in the front row while Chris Cox gave an amazing speech. Things have changed since I last worked here. Priorities differ, and the company is leaner, so things move more quickly. The company's evolution in terms of shipping features is happening at a very fast pace; it's no longer a traditional software engineering role. It's more about how integrated we are with AI. Whenever you're returning to a previous organization that you have worked with, it feels like a homecoming because there's naturally some attachment there. My piece of advice would be to try to come in with the mindset of a newbie. I'm using my previous experience to help me, but I'm also thinking of this new experience as if I were joining Meta for the first time. This approach has helped me overcome my prejudices. It's given me a chance to be a curious learner, and that's one of the most important things that you can do as a professional. Do you have a story to share about being a boomerang employee?

Title: Amazon Layoffs: Four In 10 Employees Were Engineers In Latest 14,000 Job Cuts, WARN Data Shows

Amazon Inc has done the largest workforce reduction in its history, which hit the engineering roles the most. Four in 10 employees were engineers in the latest 14,000 job cuts, WARN data showed. The company announced the layoffs on October, 2025. The move impacted all segments of its business, from cloud services, to retail, advertising, and groceries. Amazon Inc submitted the records of job reduction for New York, California, New Jersey, Washington, and show how sharply engineering was affected. Around 40% were in engineering positions of the 4,700 layoffs recorded in the state, according to data Amazon provided through Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings. WARN data showed that the cuts affected engineers at various levels but disproportionately hit software development engineering staff or the mid-level software developers. The layoffs affected more than 500 product managers and programme managers across states that field notice. They account for 10% of the total job cuts. Another section which bore the hardest hit was the gamining segment. California's WARM data showed that significant reduction in its San Diego and Irvine Studios as well as central publishing. There is no data for other states, which indicates that the figure is only a part of wider cuts. The workforce reduction happened as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy continued to overhaul for the company's internal culture. Amazon said that the artificial intelligence was not the main reason behind the layoffs. The company has reduced the workforce to reduce layers, speeding up decisions. Another wave of job cut is due on January, 2026.

Title: Amazon Ring Workers Ordered to Relocate Amid ‘AI-Powered’ Push

(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring division has ordered hundreds of customer service workers to relocate to central hubs in the US and UK amid a companywide push to streamline and automate operations. The affected personnel, who have been working remotely, will have to report to offices in Hawthorne, California; North Reading, Massachusetts; Tempe, Arizona; or London, according to a memo sent earlier this month and reviewed by Bloomberg. Hundreds of workers will have to relocate to keep their jobs, according to two people familiar with the matter. In the memo, Amazon’s video doorbell unit said it was looking to transform the customer service department into a “proactive, AI-powered support ecosystem.” A subset of workers who deal directly with customers, along with their supervisors, can still work remotely, the memo said. The department also supports Amazon’s Blink camera and home security brand. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the relocation requirement and declined to comment further. In June, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI tools capable of performing human tasks would likely shrink the company’s workforce. Four months later, Amazon announced it was eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. The latest job cuts roiled a workforce already grappling with several previous rounds of layoffs and an order to return to the office five days a week. Some employees see the relocation and return-to-office policies as efforts to force people to quit without Amazon having to pay severance. The company denies that and estimated in October that severance costs had reached $2 billion this year as of Sept. 30. Ring’s relocation mandate will likely prompt a large number of customer-service staff to leave, according to one affected employee, who requested anonymity to avoid possible retaliation. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company as CEO earlier this year and has made clear that AI will play an important role in its future. --With assistance from Matt Day.

CURRENCY OBSOLETE: Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday speculated money may become irrelevant in the future if current artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics innovations continue. SCANDAL SPIRAL: Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers resigned from the board of OpenAI amid the fallout over his correspondence with disgraced late financier Jeffery Epstein.

PRIME USERS: The artificial intelligence-related layoffs sweeping corporate America could impact prime loan borrowers, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said. ROBOT NATION: Amazon is doubling down on artificial intelligence and robotics to remake work inside its warehouses and fulfillment centers, even as it cuts thousands of corporate roles and faces growing fears about machines replacing human workers. UNITED WE STAND: The artificial intelligence boom promises to be more eventful than the dawn of the internet. It will lead to a higher quality of life for everyone in the first country to achieve AI dominance. AI is already being harnessed for cancer detection and for developing self-driving vehicles that will lower traffic fatalities.

(Shawn Thew/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images) ROBOT TAKEOVER: As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into daily life, voters hold mixed views about how (and when) it will shape their lives — and whether that impact will be positive. MAJOR MOVE: The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would direct the Justice Department to sue states that enact their own laws regulating artificial intelligence, according to a draft reviewed by Fox News Digital.

MILITARY SUPERIORITY: The Department of War is narrowing its research and development strategy to six "Critical Technology Areas" officials say will speed up innovation and strengthen America’s military edge. MISSING THE BOAT: Democrats in Washington are losing the AI conversation. Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it. DC Democrats need to reclaim the issue of AI from Republicans.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

© 2025 Griffin Media. Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Legal Notices, EEO Report, Ad Choices, Public Inspection File Contact, KWTV Public Inspection File, KSBI Public Inspection File, Closed Captioning Assistance, FCC Applications, VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month. The shutdown has left holes in more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. © 2025 Griffin Media.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Tech giant’s mega job-cut drive eliminated this one specific role the most, data shows

Amazon had in October announced that it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees. The Amazon layoffs, its largest in three years, have affected every part of the company's businesses — rom cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. However, one job category saw the most impact — engineers. According to a report by CNBC citing documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington, about 40% of the nearly 4,700 job cuts in these places were engineering roles. Amazon, which joined several other big tech companies in announcing major layoffs, reported the data in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies. The filings, which represent a segment of the data, show that the Amazon layoffs in October impacted a mix of software engineer levels. However, SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were affected disproportionately. This comes despite human resources chief Beth Galetti said in her memo announcing the Amazon layoffs mentioned that the company now specifically needs engineers as it moves on to manage work with fewer people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she added. According to the report by CNBC quoting WARN data, over 500 product managers and program managers were laid off after the October announcement, representing more than 10% of the total job cuts. Senior manager and principal level roles were also eliminated as part of the layoffs at Amazon. Amazon had in October announced that it will cut 14,000 job roles across divisions. The corporate workforce of Amazon comprises about 350,000 personnel, meaning the 14,000 cuts announced in October represent about 4% of that headcount. “The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, had said in a blog post. CEO Andy Jassy had repeatedly said he was determined to cut management layers and ease bureaucracy that began afflicting Amazon after a pandemic-era hiring binge.
