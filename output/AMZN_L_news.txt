I should've seen the writing on the wall — the company has changed. I'd rather have no job than work for a company I no longer respect. When I first joined Amazon in 2017, I felt very fortunate to work there. As a program manager working with the company's middle and last-mile operations teams, I had a great boss who knew Amazon's culture inside and out. I loved how our senior leaders valued evidence and logic over status; if you had the data, no matter your level, people listened. I loved that we spoke in the language of Amazon's leadership principles in the hallways and in meetings. "I really loved your Bias for Action there," a colleague would say, referring to the value placed on speed. I could see myself continuing to "work hard, have fun, make history" at Amazon for years to come. But in January 2023, in the middle of a personal health scare, I was one of the 18,000 employees laid off. Scared and angry, I took a 12-week severance and a small health insurance stipend. I'd dreamt for years about taking a career break but didn't feel financially secure, so I began doing part-time instructional design work as a sole proprietor while I figured out what was next. A year later, I got the opportunity to return to Amazon as a boomerang employee. I took it, but I quickly realized that the innovative, exciting work environment I remembered was gone, replaced by what I felt was ineffective leadership and a disproportionate focus on share prices. Eleven weeks after rejoining, I resigned. Here are the four red flags that told me Amazon's culture had changed. In January 2024, a former colleague reached out to me about a role that would be opening up on his team. Despite my poor layoff experience, I was enticed by the idea of rejoining Amazon and began looking for other roles on LinkedIn. I made it to the final-round interview loop for a senior product manager role. Four of the five interviews felt familiar, but my interview with the "bar raiser" — an Amazon employee specifically trained in interview skills to advise the hiring team on how to raise the bar with each new hire — felt different. At the end of the interview, I asked her how things had changed after the layoffs. She responded, knowing that I had been laid off, that the layoffs were a positive challenge for her team as they had to do more with less. Her response was a punch in the gut. So layoffs were a good thing? I'd always been told that a value at Amazon was to treat "the candidate as a customer," but didn't experience that. About a week later the recruiter shared that the team felt I would make a stronger program manager than product manager and asked me to do another interview loop for that role. I declined and told the recruiter that a second full round of interviews was duplicative and unnecessary. I ended up being offered the role and declined it because of my sour interview process. Looking back, I should have seen my interview experience as a sign of how Amazon had changed. A few weeks later, in May 2024, I accepted a different offer from Amazon for a Nashville-based role on another team I'd applied for. I was living in Atlanta and moved to Nashville to adhere to the 3-day-a-week in-office policy. Relocating was a big decision, but I felt excited to rejoin the Amazon I knew and loved, despite the interview process hiccup. Even before my first day of the new job, I saw another example of how Amazon's culture had changed: uneven implementation of return-to-office policies. I couldn't pick up my computer at the office; instead, I had to get it shipped to a non-office address. There were no assigned desks, only "agile seating." Each day I was in the office, I had to find an open desk on my assigned floor and if I wanted to store stuff at work, I had to get a locker. My onboarding that first week was entirely virtual, and I never saw any of my teammates in the office, as they all worked in different cities. And there was a two-year waitlist to get parking at my office building — my recruiter called it a "parking hellscape." It made me question: Why did I relocate my life for an in-person office experience that didn't exist? I joined the newly created content team, which my boss had taken over nine months prior. In my third week, my boss mentioned that another person on another team might take on the content strategy work he'd hired me for. In my fourth week, I was invited to a last-minute meeting, which felt ominously similar to my layoff call one year prior, and was told that the whole content team was being dissolved. I was told that my group's leadership team had been considering this move since Q4 of 2023. Despite knowing about the team's likely demise, my boss still hired four people in the two months leading up to the team being disbanded. In my previous six years at Amazon, I had never encountered these sorts of pivots. It seemed like Amazon's burgeoning bureaucracy had created an environment of no accountability. The Amazon I joined in 2016 prided itself in being "peculiar." Instead of making PowerPoint presentations, we prepared for monthly business reviews by writing six-page narratives designed to help us make data-driven decisions. Each meeting started with everyone, including directors and VPs, reading those documents for 15 to 30 minutes before starting a line-by-line discussion. When I rejoined this year, I found that people were still writing six-pagers, but they didn't seem to understand the purpose anymore. The documents didn't have the polish or data to allow in-depth discussion of the facts. Instead, the conversation would veer to topics the leaders were interested in. It seemed documents, and all the effort behind them, had become the epitome of make-work rather than a unique way to produce essential decision-making tools. A few weeks after my team was dissolved, I met with my new team leader and teammates to map out our work. I realized I saw very little of what I'd signed on to do. My layoff should've been the writing on the wall — this place has changed — but I clung to the idea of the Amazon I'd once respected, not wanting to recognize what it had become. Over and over, I hoped things would improve, but I grew tired. I knew quitting would come with a high financial cost — I'd have to return my sign-on bonus and pay for my move to Nashville — but in October 2024, eleven weeks into my Amazon return, I resigned. I decided I'd rather have no job than work for a company I didn't trust or respect anymore. In his recent letter about the five-day RTO plans, CEO Andy Jassy described reducing layers of leadership to increase employees' ability to move fast, take ownership, and increase innovation for customers. That only solves half the problem. Amazon has too many layers of management and too many ineffectual leaders. The Amazon I joined in 2016 thrummed a "fail fast and often" mentality, encouraging risk-taking that led to delightful innovations. The Amazon I rejoined in 2024 slogs along play-acting the peculiar ways, creating an environment of process obsession instead of customer obsession. I hope they can right the ship, but I won't be around to find out. In response to Business Insider's inquiry, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said that Amazon was ranked second on LinkedIn's Top Companies list this year and first in LinkedIn's Top Companies in Technology and Information.

Title: Leading The Workplace In A Second Trump Era

This week’s Future of Work newsletter dives into managing post-election uncertainty, the best employers for veterans and shares, exclusively, news that global hiring platform Oyster has netted a funding round extension. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Signage is pictured at a warehouse on October 29, 2024 in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Hannah Beier/Getty Images) We’re now six days out from last week’s historic election, one that ushered in a new world order of uncertainty, increased tribalism and—depending on your employee base—either elation or dramatically heightened fear. But as we move into our post-election reality—and as questions surrounding what leaders should say about the results give way to questions about what to do next—leading teams with integrity amid chaos will matter more than ever. Helping people find focus in a world full of distractions will be necessary as many employees are left feeling unsettled. And we’ll all need more ways to calm and regulate workplace stress amid growing uncertainty. What will tariffs mean when it comes to job creation? Senior contributor Jack Kelly takes a look at the potential impact if President-elect Donald Trump were to follow through on his threats to implement new tariffs, suggesting there could be an increase in employment opportunities in sectors directly benefiting from tariffs, such as companies scaling up domestic production. At the same time, “small businesses, which often operate with slimmer margins, might struggle more with the increased costs due to tariffs, potentially leading to closures or reduced employment,” Kelly writes. He also examines what a job search amid a presidential election transition could look like. For more on what a Trump presidency might mean on policy issues—like the minimum wage or DEI initiatives—keep reading below. This week, we also have exclusive news on new funding in global hiring platform Oyster, and as it’s Veteran’s Day, we also have our latest ranking on the best employers for veterans. Here’s to a new week. Though written before election results came in, my colleague Maria Gracia Santillana Linares examined why there wasn’t more talk about the minimum wage during the election season. (Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have both supported eliminating taxes on tips, and Trump has said he would end them on overtime pay.) Two big reasons: Change has been focused at the state level for at least the past 15 years, ever since the last time Congress passed a law enshrining a new minimum wage, and those local efforts have vastly narrowed the number of people who still work at or below the federal minimum wage to just 1.1% of U.S. workers in 2023. What will Trump’s election mean for diversity, equity and inclusion programs? HR Dive writes that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Trump will likely take a “more narrow view of what’s permissible under DEI initiatives,” quoting Jim Paretti, former senior counsel at the acting chair of the EEOC. “I think DEI in a Republican administration is going to be under a lot more scrutiny, a lot more limitations, by way of the government power of the purse,” Paretti said. The same morning as Election Day, Boeing’s striking factory workers voted to accept the company’s revised contract offer, which promised a larger wage increase and bonus payments, writes Forbes’ Siladitya Ray. The deal ended a seven-week-long work stoppage, setting the stage for the crisis-ridden company to restart production lines. Forbes recently published its fifth annual ranking of America’s Best Employers For Veterans, which is based on survey responses from more than 24,000 veterans (those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Reserves or the National Guard) working for companies with more than 1,000 employees in the United States. Respondents were asked if they would recommend their company or institution to friends and family, and to rate their employer on several criteria. This year’s No. 1? Salesforce. Read on here to learn more about the rest. Oyster CEO and cofounder Tony James On Monday, global hiring platform Oyster, Forbes can report exclusively, will announce a $5 million extension to its recent $59 million Series D funding round, which valued the company at $1.2 billion. The most recent investment, from ServiceNow Ventures, brings the company’s total funding to $291 million as it aims to compete with even bigger rivals, such as Deel, which is seen as a possible IPO candidate. Just before the new announcement, Forbes spoke with cofounder and CEO Tony Jamous who, appropriately enough for a company that helps employers hire people globally, is based in Paphos, Cyprus. Excerpts below from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. There’s a lot of players in this space, and one—Deel—that’s particularly big. How do you distinguish yourself? We saw the team members on our platform in emerging economies grow from less than 30% to more than 40% in two years. That’s what we call our impact ratio. Our rivals are going horizontal—launching HRIS platforms, they have engagement management platforms, domestic payroll. We are only interested in helping domestic companies hire in other countries. We’re focused on making global hiring as easy as local hiring. We want to make the planet Earth look like one job market. We are here for a purpose. We’re here to make the world more free and equal, democratizing access to global job opportunities. … I’d love for Deel to be extremely successful with their [potential] IPO. Please, God, help them—because it’s going to open the market for everybody. Following Amazon’s announcement about requiring five days in office, are you seeing any impact from companies wanting to hire fewer people in remote locales? We see that from big companies. They make the news. We don’t see that in our customer base. It’s a no-brainer for them to tap into the global talent pool when it comes to cost efficiency, when it comes to diversity and when it comes to accessibility to talent. … We are giving the smaller companies a super power when it comes to their talent strategy. Our growth shows that. … We grew revenues 60% last year. You recently had a big funding round. Tell me how you’re putting that to work. We’ve launched Global Payroll to help customers employ in their existing overseas entities. Importantly, we’re not competing with domestic payroll. Just cross-border. We’re also excited about growing through M&A. Our organic activity remains our top priority, but we want to remain acquisitive and opportunistic in our ability to accelerate. Third [would be] about reaching profitability. This business is an economy of scale business. How difficult was it to raise funding in this environment? The whole technology sector’s been in a [state of] constant fear. Chronic fear. Nobody knew where the valuations were headed, where the market expectations were headed. I started fundraising since the market shifted. Day one. Building relationships with investors early on, telling the story of Oyster. We shifted our focus into operational efficiency very rapidly. What are you seeing from your customers about their interest in hiring? Much, much [fewer] layoffs are happening. That was a trend that started a couple of months ago we hope will continue. The genie is out of the box. Globalization of the workforce is going to happen the same way globalization of commerce happened. The key is not to generate fear for the person in Chicago. It’s an opportunity for the person in the Philippines to ask for increasing pay and improve their life conditions. But the person in Chicago is still out of a job, no? There’s a downside for them. There are 80 million jobs going unfilled in the West. There’s a job shortage. … There is a massive need for knowledge workers to work for companies in the West that cannot be filled with the amount of workers that are available. It’s open enrollment season for benefits. A new survey from Corebridge Financial looks at how employers can best support their workers—at a time when choices are more important than ever for workers to get right. 18%: The percentage of workers who find the process of open enrollment confusing and complex 68%: The percentage of both Gen Z and Millennial workers who want their employers to provide one-on-one support for enrolling in new benefits “Personalization is key. People are in different stages of their lives and may have different benefit needs.”— Terri Fiedler, President, Retirement Services at Corebridge Financial How to infuse your messaging with your company’s values Here are four work habits to develop before year’s end How leaders can address workplace anxiety after the 2024 election A Jeff Bezos-owned brand said last week it would expect workers back in the office five days a week next year and move away from its current hybrid schedule in 2025.

Title: Amazon Has Slashed Its US Ad Spend by $700 Million This Year

Time Published: 2024-11-11T11:00:00Z

As Amazon’s revenue and stock price continue to climb, the company is also pulling back. Between January and August, Amazon cut its U.S. ad spend by 20%—equivalent to $700 million—compared to the same time in 2023, according to estimates from ad intelligence platform MediaRadar. The drop from $3.4 billion to $2.7 billion comes amid other cost-cutting measures across the company under CEO Andy Jassy, who took control of the ecommerce giant after founder Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021. Amazon has shut down brick-and-mortar stores, such as the Go convenience chain and grocery services. It’s also undergone rounds of layoffs. Annual reports reveal the company shrunk from around 1.61 million full- and part-time employees in 2021 to 1.53 million last year. Overall, Amazon’s global investment in advertising and other promotional costs related to its various products and services, from Twitch to Whole Foods to Amazon Web Services, has decreased from $20.6 billion in 2022 to $20.3 billion in 2023, per its annual reports. (MediaRadar’s data only captures U.S. ad spend for Amazon’s core retail business.) Amazon’s Ad Business Grew Faster Than the Company’s Overall Growth in Q3 These cost reductions appear to be working. Amazon reported $17.4 billion in operating income during its recent third-quarter earnings, up 55% year over year. “We’ve definitely seen Amazon increase their margins over the past couple of quarters,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder and CEO of retail research firm Marketplace Pulse. In total, retailers Amazon, Walmart, Temu, Target, and Shein spent $5.6 billion on advertising between January and August 2024, representing a 11% year-over-year decrease. Amazon, Target, Walmart, Shein, and Temu either declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Ad spending, however, fluctuates by retailer. Temu’s investment in paid media, for example, grew 13%—indicative of the Chinese-based retailer’s continued increase in ad spending. Despite Temu’s high-priced Super Bowl ads the past couple of years, 77% of Temu’s advertising dollars went toward digital this year, according to MediaRadar. Kaziukėnas said Temu’s heavy reliance on digital ads—usually ads that promote specific products—shows how the retailer hasn’t become a mainstream name for U.S. consumers. “Relative to other retailers, Temu has a high ratio of sales coming from advertising,” he said. “It has very little stickiness and perpetually has to spend on advertising to remind people that it exists.” Meanwhile, China-based Shein’s ad spend dropped by 49% year-over-year—though from a significantly smaller base than Temu. Unlike Temu, Shein doesn’t need to spend on advertising to acquire customers because it’s more well-known and drives organic sales from social media and other channels, Kaziukėnas said. “They can afford to spend less on marketing to get the sales they need,” he said. Elsewhere, Target’s ad spend dropped 9%, while Walmart’s increased 9% during the same period. Lauren Johnson is Adweek's deputy editor of retail media and commerce.

Title: What needs to go right for Intel, and what happens if it doesn't

Time Published: 2024-11-11T10:00:02Z

US policymakers are still betting that Intel is the nation's best shot at manufacturing chips. It's a long shot. The S&P Dow Jones Indices said on November 1 that Intel is losing its 25-year spot to Nvidia in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel's stock has dropped nearly 50% so far this year, and the company has faced billions in losses. It's also had sweeping layoffs, buyouts, and other setbacks. The many moving parts of Intel's strategy could still help it recover from its recent setbacks if they're executed well. Business Insider spoke with industry analysts to ask what should go right for Intel to get back on track. Intel has specifically lagged in the age of generative AI compared to competitors like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD, which have their chips produced by Taiwan-based chip giant TSMC. BI's Alistair Barr previously wrote that since Intel is the only company manufacturing high-powered chips on American soil at scale, rather than outsourcing the job to Taiwan, the company is a key part of the bedrock of the country's technology ecosystem. "Chips power the modern economy," he wrote. "If you have to get these components overseas, you're vulnerable." Given lawmakers' keen geopolitical and economic interests in maintaining the US's technological advantage, that means weighing all possible outcomes for Intel's future as the company struggles to gain its footing in the AI race. "What's going on in Intel is not good, and being removed from the Dow is just sort of the cherry on the sundae," said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's 18A process technology is key to its strategy and its next shot at a new process node after struggling with previous node upgrades. If the technology succeeds, Intel can win over customers and turn itself around. Intel has executed five improved chip nodes in the last four years, resulting in smaller and more powerful transistors, "which is a feat in itself," said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst of Moor Insights and Strategy. Still, in recent years, Intel has failed to keep up with TSMC in the latest chip nodes. Moorhead added that Intel is investing to "catch up" to its competitors. "Its 18A node appears to be healthy and competitive, which is the key to its turnaround and the ability to recruit more foundry customers," Moorhead said. Intel has announced Amazon as an 18A customer so far. "You have to trust Intel to manufacture your chips on advanced processes, which they've just started adopting, efficiently and on time which they haven't done yet," said Logan Purk, a senior analyst at Edward Jones. Intel plans to spin out its semiconductor manufacturing business into an independent subsidiary called Intel Foundry, separating the manufacturing process from its chip-design business. For this to work, the foundry business will need other major companies, including its rivals, to use Intel to manufacture their chip designs in large volumes. This hasn't happened yet. Other chip companies that have separated their manufacturing and designing have succeeded, said Dan Morgan, a senior trust portfolio manager at Synovus. He pointed to AMD spinning off its manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries as an example, and he estimated that Intel's foundry business alone could be valued as high as $80 billion. Highlighting Intel's challenge here, GlobalFoundries only has a market cap of just $24 billion as of publication time. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also said that Intel is making progress in cutting costs in their recent staff reductions and real estate sales. "Balance sheet is an area of focus for investors given the company's aggressive capex plan and ongoing losses in the foundry business," Morgan said. Rasgon said Intel is facing a "dire emergency" but likely isn't so desperate as to declare bankruptcy or sell off portions of its business at a fire sale price. Moreover, Intel still holds over 75% of the market share of data center chips and PCs. "It's not like the company's just bleeding out," Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology research and advisory firm Futurum Group, told BI. Washington's concerns about Intel have become a sharper focus as the company has continued to slip from its spot as a top chipmaker. Intel is set to receive billions from the federal government under the CHIPS and Science Act to boost American semiconductor manufacturing — though the company hasn't received any funds yet. If Intel can contain costs and efficiently apply its grant funding, Newman said, "there is a possibility that it could get back to a level of profitability that would make it sustainable." The government has taken other steps to boost Intel. Gina Raimondo, the US secretary of commerce, took multiple private meetings and calls to urge chief executives from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and other firms to buy chips from Intel to shore up the company's manufacturing wing and solidify its role in US-based chip production," The New York Times reported last month. Under Donald Trump's presidential administration, Intel could receive support for domestic manufacturing while facing higher tariffs and pushback on the CHIPS Act. "Under the incoming administration, which arguably has an even greater nationalist tone, homegrown companies actually stand to benefit," said Purk. Not everyone is convinced that government intervention will help Intel get back on track in chip manufacturing. "It's all fine and dandy for the government to say, 'Yeah, we want you to use Intel,'" Rasgon said. "Like, that's great, but it's not going to happen unless Intel can deliver." Intel's foundry business has been slow to take off, and the potential for it to reinvigorate the American chipmaking landscape hasn't stopped rumblings about a possible breakup — with competitors like Qualcomm reportedly interested in buying parts of Intel — or policymakers in Washington discussing potential contingency plans. Officials from the Commerce Department and Sen. Mark Warner, who championed the CHIPS Act, met for precautionary strategy talks to discuss how the government should support Intel if it needs more help, Semafor reported. The report said they also discussed a potential merger between the company's chip design business and a competitor like AMD or Marvell. "If, for some reason, this foundry thing continues to take longer, the losses continue to mount, the technological progress does not take hold, sales falter, or the company's ability to stay together does, I do believe that they are setting it up in that direction to be able to have options — whether they spin it off and take it public separately, or bring private equity into it, or they're able to bring a buyer to the table," Newman said. Intel, the Commerce Department, and a representative for Warner did not respond to requests for comment from BI. Jump to

Title: To establish value, focus more on high priority projects: Reading Michael Lynch's post on why he quit Google to work for himself
URL: https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/reading-lynch-focus-on-high-priority-projects
Time Published: 2024-11-11T08:00:00Z

by Tom Johnson on Nov 11, 2024 categories: technical-writing Although this post by Michael Lynch titled Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself was published in 2018, it trended on Hacker News last week. It caught my attention because I recently underwent a similar promotion process, though with a positive outcome. Lynch, an engineer, highlights a couple of points relevant to technical writers: writing documentation doesn't support an engineer's demonstration of technical complexity, and the projects you work on might matter more than the quality of your output. Documentation dDoesn’t help engineering promotions The importance of working on high-impact projects Documentation dDoesn’t help engineering promotions First, in one of his attempts at promotion, he noted that in one of his projects, he even “documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head.” The cartoon graphic in his post then says, “I documented this component that nobody understood.” To which the committee responds, “Anyone can write documentation. Where are the metrics proving it helped Google?” Writing docs is not important for engineering promotion As engineers focus on projects with high technical complexity, writing documentation will be an insignificant footnote for most hiring committees. It’s not a factor in a promo packet where an engineer would demonstrate how they fixed a problem of significant technical complexity. Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn’t fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they’re capable of writing. Lynch writes, “I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn’t proven I could handle technical complexity ….” The importance of working on high-impact projects The second highlight from this post is Lynch’s attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains: “To continue advancing my career, I’d need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams.” If you work on projects no one cares about, it’s also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I’m in. The products are a profit center with many big-name partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I’m the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the business interests of the company, then no matter how exceedingly awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn’t matter much because the product area wouldn’t be significant to the positive impact of the company. I’ve written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my seven-part series Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off.) Lynch’s post suggests that it doesn’t matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I seemed to intuitively understand this, because I’ve consistently gravitated toward providing documentation for what I perceive to be the most important projects in a company. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it’s the automotive API products. In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? Sure, if a product has an upcoming release, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize doc fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there’s a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company? In one comment on Hacker News by “nostrademons”, an engineering manager explains: “Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager. The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do …” I’m more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where I work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where I seem to coast. No one seems to notice or care. What matters is your general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, your manager’s ability to understand that and to highlight your involvement in those projects, spinning up your role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.

Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn’t fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they’re capable of writing. Lynch writes, “I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn’t proven I could handle technical complexity ….” The second highlight from this post is Lynch’s attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains: “To continue advancing my career, I’d need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams.” If you work on projects no one cares about, it’s also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I’m in. The products are a profit center with many big-name partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I’m the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the business interests of the company, then no matter how exceedingly awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn’t matter much because the product area wouldn’t be significant to the positive impact of the company. I’ve written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my seven-part series Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off.) Lynch’s post suggests that it doesn’t matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I seemed to intuitively understand this, because I’ve consistently gravitated toward providing documentation for what I perceive to be the most important projects in a company. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it’s the automotive API products. In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? Sure, if a product has an upcoming release, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize doc fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there’s a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company? In one comment on Hacker News by “nostrademons”, an engineering manager explains: “Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager. The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do …” I’m more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where I work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where I seem to coast. No one seems to notice or care. What matters is your general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, your manager’s ability to understand that and to highlight your involvement in those projects, spinning up your role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.

Title: Big Tech’s hotbeds of employee activism quiet after Trump’s victory

Monday, 11 Nov 2024 Google employees in New York walk out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment claims on Nov 1, 2018. Tech sector executives have worked to dampen employee activism in recent years, a push reflected in workers’ muted public reaction to Donald Trump’s re-election. — The New York Times SEATTLE: If any industry could have said its workplaces were politicised, it was tech. Early in Donald Trump’s first term in the White House, America’s tech giants loudly protested his temporary ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, posted that his great-grandparents were immigrants and that his in-laws were refugees. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, rushed to San Francisco International Airport to protest. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, joined a crowd of employees rallying at the company’s corporate headquarters. “Wow, thank you everyone for showing up today,” he said to cheers. “It’s remarkable.” But after this week’s presidential election, the largely liberal workforces of tech’s biggest companies were quiet. While the definitive nature of the election most likely played a role, the change also represented an effort by executives to dampen employee activism in recent years. They put in place policies restricting dialogue, monitored internal chat channels and vowed not to weigh in on the issues that fired up activist employees. If the presidential election was going to be the biggest test of these new rules, the vigilance wasn’t necessary. Reactions to the election on company message boards and forums were muted. On a companywide Google forum, someone posted an American flag with the note, “Sending support to American colleagues,” which was liked by more than 1,000 employees. “My heart is heavy,” one Amazon employee wrote in an internal chat. “I may not know you, but know that I love you.” The heads of most of the country’s leading tech employers didn’t acknowledge the election results to their staffs, though many of them posted their congratulations to Trump on X, praising his “decisive” and “hard-fought” victory. "Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on his decisive victory,” Pichai wrote on X. “We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone.” Amazon, Meta and Google declined to comment. Trump’s victory landed in an industry deeply changed since his last term. Tech companies had long espoused the idea of bringing your whole self to work, and they were built on a culture of blunt expression. But the turmoil of the past several years — from the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to the war in the Gaza Strip — have turned off executives from the freewheeling cultures they once fostered. And as they have focused their companies on efficiency coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have also taken a more assertive approach to their own workers, enacting in some cases the largest layoffs in their histories and demanding that people return to working in an office — or show themselves the door. Google since 2019 has instructed employees to keep politics out of the workplace, and this year the company cracked down on its irreverent Memegen forum, its corporate town square, after workers feuded about the war in Gaza. On Monday, Pichai reminded his 181,000 employees not to discuss politics in the workplace regardless of who won the election, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times. “Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief,” Pichai wrote. The company is “at its best” when focusing on its mission and products, he added. Employees largely had conversations in smaller groups and more private forums. A few looked for ways to express their discontent without drawing the attention of the company’s internal content moderators. The moderators were removing political posts and temporarily suspending uploading privileges for employees who repeatedly broke the rules, said three people with knowledge of the moderation, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. CNBC earlier reported on the takedowns and Pichai’s email. Moderators also took down vague posts without captions that were assumed to be about the election, one of the people said, including a number of posts featuring black squares, a symbol of mourning. Meta’s human resources department, with support from Zuckerberg, introduced a policy in late 2022 called “community engagement expectations,” according to a copy of the memo reviewed by the Times. It expressly forbade employees to discuss in the workplace hot-button political issues, including abortion, racial justice movements, wars and political news. Amazon’s senior leaders pulled back this year on issuing frequent statements on political or cultural issues, according to three people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several Amazon executives spoke about the future in a two-hour companywide meeting and did not mention the election once. Andy Jassy, the company’s CEO, defended its office mandate against claims it was a “backdoor layoff,” expressed hope in the company’s AI innovations and praised experiments to deliver eggs faster to customers. But the real test of tech’s newfound neutrality will be once Trump takes office, if he follows through on his promises on issues the companies have opposed. “Remember the famous travel ban?” he said at a September rally. He vowed to bring it back. – ©2024 The New York Times Company Related stories: What will Trump 2.0 mean for US tech?Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Tech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Topic: Report it to us.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Former Google lead Andrew Yeung has been dubbed the Gatsby of Silicon Valley. He shared the coffee chat formula that's helped him grow his seven-figure tech event business. On the agenda today: But first: What happens next after Donald Trump's resounding US election victory. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The most expensive presidential election in history is over, and the effects of Donald Trump's victory are already being felt in dollars and cents. Stocks surged, finishing the week at record highs. Bitcoin also hit record highs, while Tesla surpassed a $1 trillion market cap. Treasury yields also finished the week higher, as investors bet that a Trump White House will drive inflation. Big companies are already weighing the potential impact of tariffs. Outdoors brand Yeti is looking for new suppliers. Steve Madden plans to cut its sourcing of goods from China. Airbus said it expects to pass the cost of any tariffs on to airline customers. In Silicon Valley, many venture capitalists and startup founders are cheering the prospect of less regulation and increased deal activity. On Wall Street, too, there's hope of less onerous regulation, particularly as several financiers are offering advice to the incoming administration. And at least one media CEO hopes Trump's win will open the doors to consolidation. Goldman Sachs promoted 95 executives to its highest designation of leaders outside the C-suite. The new class is the largest number of partners to be promoted under CEO David Solomon. It's also one of Goldman's most diverse. A record 26 are women — a demographic that has been closely watched following a series of high-profile female partner exits — as well as a record level of Hispanic executive promotions, a company exec said. Check out the list. Also read: In an all-hands meeting this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the company's recent plan to reduce the number of managers. According to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI, Jassy said the move was meant to root out bureaucracy. The goal is to make faster decisions and reduce management layers that are killing Amazon's unique culture, Jassy said. "The reality is that the S team and I hate bureaucracy," Jassy said, referring to Amazon's most senior leadership team. More from the all-hands meeting. Also read: There's no such thing as free lunch — or in one investor's case, free dinner. As a retiree, he was used to avoiding the countless postcards offering a fancy dinner accompanied by a presentation on investing advice. But on one occasion in 2010, he took the bait. There, he met one of the hosts who would eventually advise him to invest in financial products that ultimately cost him a chunk of his retirement savings. Why these 'free lunch seminars' are common in the industry. Regular Americans are shoplifting everything from tape measures to blocks of cheese. Rather than stealing out of true necessity, these shoplifters are opportunists: adults with decent jobs, firmly in the middle class. And they don't feel particularly bad about it. Some of them view shoplifting as a silly childhood habit they never kicked out, while others think of it as a way to fight back against goods that are unjustly expensive. Behind regular people's retail theft. Also read: This week's quote: "I congratulate President Trump and we look forward to working with the new administration in support of sound policies that enhance economic growth and financial stability." — Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in an internal memo to staff.

Title: Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Empire in Trouble?
URL: https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/is-gwyneth-paltrows-goop-empire-in-trouble.php
Time Published: 2024-11-08T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | November 8, 2024 | For the past 16 years, Goop has been one of the shining lights in the celebrity business sphere. Gwyneth Paltrow’s woo-woo wellness company has endured a lot of jokes (and extremely legitimate criticism about its suspect claims and the people it supports), but it’s remained a major hit. In 2018, the New York Times reported that Goop was worth an estimated $250 million, thanks to its unusual wellness offerings like psychic vampire repellent and jade vagina eggs. Not bad for what started out as a newsletter by a bored actress. But now, reports are suggesting that Goop is stumbling. Last year, Goop opened a store in London, which closed quickly due to lack of interest. RadarOnline is claiming that closure led to around a $2 million loss for the company. Last week, Business Insider reported that Goop had undergone a second round of layoffs in only two months. In 2021, they also reported that 140 employees left the company in just two years. Among the issues cited were low salaries, poor leadership, and favoritism among the higher ranks. Yes, the pandemic shutdown didn’t help but the bleeding doesn’t seem to have stopped for Goop. Over the past month, things have gotten bad enough that The Times suggested that Goop is undergoing an entire business reshuffle just to stay afloat. Puck also got in on the act, reporting that, while Goop’s food vertical is doing well, the fashion and beauty parts are suffering. This is bad news given that they only recently launched a skincare line, available via Target. Puck wrote: Yikes. Puck then had sources saying that Paltrow seemed to have ‘disdain’ for some of the products she was selling, although Goop denied this in a statement. Goop has always been a strange and unique presence in the world of celebrity branding. It’s so specifically Gwyneth and so deliberately inaccessible to the biggest markets and demographics that it shouldn’t have worked. Yet it became the benchmark for the celeb business model for years, with many a copycat (hello, Blake Lively) and wannabes following in its bare footsteps. Goop was widely derided for questionable science and promotion of straight-up quackery but there is also a known and monied audience who love that crap. Paltrow was savvy in commodifying all of this faux-wellness nonsense and selling it to her fellow rich white ladies. She was also extremely good at monetising those rage clicks and playing along with her own parodic image, as evidenced by that vagina candle that sadly exploded from time to time. So, what changed? The wellness industry certainly hasn’t died; it’s only grown more powerful and intimidating since lockdown, and my Instagram feed is full of ‘self-care’ routines that are merely extended ads for a lot of Temu and Amazon crap. Rich lady companies are doing fine too, because that’s a demographic that stays rich regardless of the changing political tides. I don’t think it’s that we’re suddenly aware that Goop was peddling bullsh*t either. Sadly, snake oil and anti-pharma-driven rhetoric is extremely popular right now, and on all sides of the political spectrum. To me, it seems like Goop has never been a hugely reliable profit maker for Paltrow. She herself admitted that at a business summit with Forbes, saying, ‘Some years, we’ve doubled in growth. Some years, we are flat. Some years, we’re down, then we’re back up.’ She wasn’t a businesswoman who jumped into a gap in the market. She was an actress whose side-project became a thing and she went along with it. Plus, while there is a niche for what she sells, it’s not as wide as would be needed to sustain a multi-pronged, Fenty-esque empire. Selling your makeup line in Target at an affordable price is a good idea, but nobody expects Goop to be affordable or for the masses, least of all people who go to Target and know what they want. If you’re looking for a moisturizer and one of the celebs shilling it to you has a dodgy history with pseudoscience and also radiates ‘eat the poors,’ why would you buy it? Both skincare and clothing are crowded markets, even without the celeb brands in the mix. Where once everyone chased Gwyneth, now they all follow after Rihanna, and Fenty Beauty and Skin are killing it. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty is a billion-dollar brand too. Plenty of celebrities have tried and failed to make their brands in this field a hit. It’s an expensive gamble and even the biggest skincare addicts are hesitant to put all that money down for a new product just because a famous name is attached. At least with a booze line, you can still get drunk. If Goop is to survive, my guess is that it will be under someone else’s ownership. Puck certainly seemed to believe that a sale could happen in the future, which would make Paltrow even richer and probably result in more layoffs. Goop’s legacy is secure, but not in a great way. It was a landmark in modern celebrity branding, but it also further legitimized entire swaths of fake science, wellness nonsense, and quackery that was one step removed from anti-vax propaganda. As much as Paltrow tried to laugh off criticism and embrace her ‘white lady bullsh*t’ image, the reverberations of bad science and health-driven fearmongering are far mightier than a vagina candle.

Title: Is generative AI hitting a ceiling? Maybe, but investors don’t care
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2024/11/08/generative-ai-hitting-ceiling-maybe-investors-dont-care/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T15:37:11Z

UPDATED 10:37 EST / NOVEMBER 08 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Of course the presidential election looms over everything, and I’ll just say one thing: Any executives or investors counting on President-elect Donald Trump keeping the vast majority of promises he has made are not as smart as they think they are. Maybe they just want their taxes and regulations cut, and they may well get those. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who believe we will now be entering a wonderland of building under a Trump administration, wonder if generative AI models are hitting their limits. A few other people have been baying at the moon about this for a while, so it’s worth pondering what that means for the current boom. Nonetheless, even if the current approach by some to create AGI isn’t the right way to go, that doesn’t mean there isn’t utility for users today, so investors keep pouring the money into AI companies such as Anthropic, Perplexity and Physical Intelligence. Speaking of big spending, those plans by Amazon, Meta and Google to jumpstart nuclear plants to power all that AI? They could take a while. An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management this week calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions — few of which seem all that compelling ways to spur innovation. It’s still not entirely clear what’s going on with Supermicro’s books, but investors don’t like the signs one bit as its stock tanked again this week as its revenue missed estimates as well. Other earnings reports came in decidedly mixed. Arm and Qualcomm did pretty well partly on AI momentum, and so did GlobalFoundries, but NXP not so much. Cloudflare and Akamai also provided disappointing guidance. Broadcom expanded its VMware private-cloud options, which could prove good timing for the special edge needs of AI. Next week is KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City. TheCUBE will be there and SiliconANGLE will have the news and analysis. I’ll be at BoxWorks in San Francisco too. Earnings reports slow down, but next week we’ll be looking at Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, among a few others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: Breaking Analysis: Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s biggest competitor Are generative AI models topping out in their capabilities? Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz think they are, at least for now. Some people warned us. David Linthicum digs in: What do multimodal AI and smaller language models mean for enterprises? A glimpse with George Gilbert into Uber’s cutting-edge data approach: Uber revamps its operating model with real-time data and microservice orchestration Federal court sides with OpenAI in AI copyright lawsuit Hedge fund Coatue is raising $1B for AI bets Amazon reportedly mulls another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic – but with an added twist Perplexity AI’s value to soar to $9B as it finalizes new $500M funding round AIs will need physical knowledge at least as much as text knowledge, so perhaps feedback from robots using AI brains will help: AI startup Physical Intelligence raises $400M to create a brain for any robot Siit raises $5M for its AI-powered service desk platform Nvidia announces new robot AI learning and simulation tools Anthropic partners with AWS and Palantir to provide AI models to defense agencies UnifyApps reels in $20M for its AI-powered application platform Diliko launches agentic AI-powered data management platform for midsized enterprises MuleSoft helps businesses create real-time AI agents with AsyncAPI support View Systems launches AI-optimized data management platform There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Amazon, Meta nuclear power initiatives reportedly encounter challenges An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions. Perhaps some of those are good ideas in concept, but it’s not that convincing to me, especially the stock buybacks front and center. One would hope Andy Jassy and Matt Garman have better ideas. (Though admittedly they could have done a lot better on “Rings of Power.”) Cloudbrink co-founder’s lawsuit draws attention of the SEC and DOJ Supermicro’s stock falls on revenue miss and uncertainty over annual filing, increasing fears of a delisting Qualcomm and Arm cruise to another earnings and revenue beat NXP tumbles on weak outlook as automotive chip revenue declines GlobalFoundries shares jump on strong mobile business growth Kyndryl sees good traction with AI consulting services, and its stock moves higher Disappointing guidance sends Cloudflare and Akamai stocks lower Datadog tops earnings expectations amid cybersecurity, AI growth Rapid7’s revenue and earnings top forecasts amid product enhancements Fortinet shares dip despite beating revenue and earnings estimates Dynatrace shares close lower despite strong second quarter Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand DigitalOcean shares drop 13% despite expectation-topping earnings, raised guidance Astera Labs delivers blowout earnings and revenue beat and its stock jumps Palantir shares surge over 12% on strong earnings and raised revenue outlook Lyft shares surge over 20% as revenue growth outpaces expectations despite earnings miss HubSpot earnings top forecasts with 20% revenue growth and customer gains Five9 shares surge over 20% following strong quarter and upgraded guidance JFrog’s stock stutters on lukewarm guidance, despite accelerating revenue and customer wins And more… Broadcom broadens private cloud options And Zeus Kerravala’s analysis: VMware’s bevy of updates to VCF at Explore Barcelona 2024: Here’s why they matter AMD overtook Intel for the first time in data center revenue in the third quarter, according to SemiAnalysis TSMC, GlobalFoundries reportedly complete CHIPS Act funding negotiations EU launches antitrust probe into Apple glass supplier Corning IonQ snaps up quantum networking company Qubitekk, but financial results disappoint investors Rackspace offers GPUs as a cloud service with spot instance pricing We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps CrowdStrike acquires cloud security provider Adaptive Shield Malwarebytes acquires VPN provider AzireVPN Attack & response That’s a lot of dough: Ransomware gang demands ransom payment in Schneider Electric data breach: baguettes Canada arrests suspected hacker over breach of 160+ Snowflake users’ data Google’s Big Sleep AI model sets world first with discovery of SQLite security flaw City of Columbus acknowledges data theft after lawsuit against security researcher JFrog report highlights critical security flaws in machine learning platforms White-noise apps exploited in major audio ad fraud schemes, report finds Fortinet expands generative AI in cybersecurity portfolio with new FortiAI integrations Permiso launches three open-source tools to enhance cloud security detection Kloudfuse enhances observability platform with AI tools and scalable data management More cybersecurity news here Amazon gets green light to start drone deliveries in Arizona Lyft inks new partnerships to make autonomous taxis available through its app TikTok told to close its business in Canada amid national security concerns Bad timing for the New York Times as its tech union goes on strike And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Mozilla‘s open internet advocacy efforts falter as it lays off 30% of its staff Gabor Cselle, co-founder and former CEO of defunct X rival Pebble, has joined OpenAI to work on a “secretive project” (per TechCrunch).Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta’s former head of augmented reality hardware, is also joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware.

Good morning. Jay-Z has 99 problems, but Block ain’t one…for now, anyway. Executives at the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey—or is it Rick Rubin? I can barely tell their beards apart these days—have ordered staff not to mention the board member and Beyoncé spouse on internal channels, according to Fortune colleague Kali Hays. No one’s quite sure why, but successive layoffs at music streaming service Tidal—which Block quixotically bought from Jay-Z—haven’t helped. Perhaps Dorsey should channel zenmaster-megaproducer Rubin after all: “Do what you can with what you have. Nothing more is needed.” —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. Airbnb said Thursday it wants to accelerate its growth and prepare for the company’s next chapter “beyond accommodations.” In a letter to shareholders, the lodging marketplace said it made headway making it easier for people to host, making its namesake app more helpful (including clearing out low-quality listings), and expanding beyond its core markets. The last point is most interesting. Airbnb operates in a number of countries and regions it considers “under-penetrated.” In Q3, the company said it was able to boost the average growth rate of nights booked in those markets to more than double its core set. Airbnb reported $2.73 billion in third-quarter revenue, barely beating Wall Street’s estimates. It also reported earnings per share of $2.13, just missing expectations. As for its future beyond lodging? We’ll see “next year,” the company says. Speculation runs rampant for what that means, but rest assured the company will leverage its strength in building a “moat,” as CEO Brian Chesky put it last year, around its existing customer base. —AN Baidu is reportedly preparing to unveil a pair of smart glasses with a built-in AI assistant. A new Bloomberg report says the company, which is to China what Google is to the U.S., plans to showcase the product at its annual company event in Shanghai next week. The specs will have all the usual trappings: built-in cameras for photos and videos, a built-in microphone for voice interactions, and Baidu’s Ernie large language model underpinning it all. Hopefully the product will look as good as Meta’s Ray-Bans, which were released more than a year ago in partnership with global eyewear juggernaut EssilorLuxottica. The combination of tech and style has proven unbeatable—who doesn’t look good in a pair of Blues Brothers-esque Wayfarers?—even if the underlying tech is getting long in the tooth. Baidu will reportedly charge less than Meta’s $300 for its eyewear, which is expected early next year. But like Meta’s specs, the real question is how well it accelerates use of its various Internet-connected, ad-based services where the revenue is really made. —AN Remember the days when people were having conversations about armies theoretically using AI? Now AI has been used in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza (for drone piloting and target identification respectively) and AI companies are jostling for space at the Defense Department’s table. Days after Meta announced a bouquet of partnerships with military contractors, Anthropic, Palantir and Amazon Web Services have revealed a three-headed competitor. Anthropic’s Claude LLM will be integrated into Palantir’s intelligence-analysis system, with the whole thing running on AWS. Amazon is Anthropic’s biggest investor, and the pair already offer their joint services to the U.S. government. OpenAI, which quietly changed its terms earlier in the year to allow this, is also now looking for DOD business. It’s now the military-AI-industrial complex. —David Meyer Shares of Pinterest took a double-digit-percentage dive, to about $29, in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company offered fourth-quarter guidance below Wall Street’s expectations. The social media company said it expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. The midpoint of that range trails analyst estimates of $1.143 billion. Pinterest’s CFO, Julia Donnelly, said on a conference call that the company saw softer demand from food and beverage advertisers in Q3, dragging down its $898 million in quarterly revenue (which was otherwise up 18% from the same period last year). That will continue in Q4, she said—which aligns with the outlook of other ad-based businesses during the recent spate of corporate earnings reports. Another thing to note? Pinterest’s expenses. They were up 17% year over year, to $904 million, from R&D investment and spending on employees with AI expertise. —AN Tech’s biggest executives pretty much ignored Donald Trump after he won the White House in the shocking presidential election in 2016. This time around? Not so much. According to various reports over the last few months, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg privately reached out to Trump before voting began for the recent election. “They flattered him,” a New York Times summary reads. “They shared their troubles. They criticized his opposition. They emphasized common enemies.” And they hoped for better business. Trump went out of his way during his first term to criticize—or outright punish—the tech companies who opposed him. After Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2016 that Trump’s stated refusal to concede the election if he lost (he didn’t) “erodes our democracy around the edges,” among other things, Trump allegedly pushed the Pentagon to deny Amazon’s cloud computing unit a $10 billion defense contract. (A lawsuit was later dismissed.) Fast forward to today. The Washington Post owner published on X just two days ago: “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella all had similar things to say. And the remaining Magnificent Seven tech CEOs, you ask? Tesla’s Elon Musk has hardly slowed in posting support for Trump on X, which he owns; meanwhile Nvidia’s Jensen Huang manages to escape with a nearly nonexistent social media presence. —AN —Binance billionaire “CZ” speaks after four months in prison. —Cloudflare expects softer sales in the wake of stiffer cybersecurity competition. —Toast has a blowout quarter. Shares of the restaurant app were up 15%. (Yes, chef.) —CFPB told workers not to use phones because of hack. Living life in a Salt Typhoon. —France regulator sniffing around Polymarket gambler.

Title: Mozilla Foundation cuts staff and eliminates advocacy division, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff”

Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Greetings, comms pros! Let’s look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% of staff while also cutting its advocacy function The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit wing of the company that makes the Firefox internet browser, is cutting jobs and getting rid of its advocacy function amid “a relentless onslaught of change”. Mozilla Foundation CCO Brandon Borman affirmed the layoffs in a memo to staff. According to Tech Crunch : “The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics. Mozilla is known for advocating for privacy and inclusion on the internet. This move brings some of that ethos into question going forward. For comms pros, it’s worth asking — what do you do when your company cuts a big part of your identity as a way of remaining stable? There’s no right answer, but one of the solutions is to dive headfirst into employee experience as it ties into brand identity. Show your employees they matter and hedge that in messaging that proves you’re still the great place to work they were onboarded with originally. Organizational identities change — that’s part of business. But you can remind people that the cultural positives they relate to are the same — that’s how you communicate your way through these types of major shifts. 2 . Amazon CEO says RTO process isn’t a pretext for layoffs Amazon chief Andy Jassy denied that the company’s RTO mandate wasn’t intended as a method of covertly cutting jobs, but instead as a method of making the company’s culture stronger by having employees in the office five days a week. According to Reuters: “A number of people I’ve seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it’s a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,” said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said. It’s interesting to see the head of a company as big as Amazon address the speculation around an RTO process head-on. RTO programs should always consider culture as a guidepost for both the rollout and communication of the initiative. Any well-done RTO process needs to follow a checklist of sorts to find success. Earlier this year, we outlined RTO success points. The best RTOs can get off on the right foot by doing the following: It’s not enough to just say that culture matters — you need to show it in action. Once you call your people back, give them reasons to appreciate their time in the office, like more upskilling initiatives with colleagues and face time with leaders. There are benefits to working in the office — comms pros should highlight them, allow leaders to talk about them, and make them a central part of company culture beyond lip service. 3. NLRB files complaint against Apple for threatening employees who talked about compensation and work-from-home benefits The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against tech giant Apple, alleging that the organization threatened repercussions against employees who talked about their pay or working from home. MSN reported that according to accounts from former workers at the company, Apple employees were allegedly threatened when talking about bonuses, ordered to delete a social media post about how other employees could continue working remotely, and forced to stop mentioning their pay on internal comms platforms. Another, software engineer Cher Scarlett claimed that she was forced out of her role for creating an internal survey for employee compensation. Apple has yet to comment on the allegations. When employees feel they’re in a more open environment, they’re able to be their authentic selves and more likely to stay. In 2023, we covered the topic of job-hopping and how to combat it. In that piece, we cited a Flexjobs survey that stated 62% of employees cited toxic work environments as one of their top reasons to leaving a company, followed by pay at 59%. If your employees can’t talk about things they want to improve or their pay, there’s a good chance they won’t stick around, and those numbers prove it. Sure, Apple is one of the biggest-name corporations on the planet. But that doesn’t mean that the same rules don’t apply to employee satisfaction. Outreach via surveys and other touchpoints can help communicators gather information from employees about how they feel on topics like compensation, benefits and more. Running that info up the ladder to leaders can then affect change. Encourage your people to share their views. If you stifle them, you’re sowing the seeds for discontent and poor culture. 4.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.
