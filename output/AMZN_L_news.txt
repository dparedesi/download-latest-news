Who Needs Sports? The Washington Post is bracing for massive layoffs that have employees questioning owner Jeff Bezos’s commitment to the newspaper’s long-term health, Status reports. WaPo reportedly plans to slash 100 of its 800 newsroom positions next month, with the cuts likely to primarily impact the sports, metro and foreign news teams. In total, 300 positions may be eliminated across the company. Why the layoffs? WaPo’s advertising and subscription businesses have been struggling for years. WaPo infamously lost a quarter million digital subscribers, or 10% of its subscriber base, after Bezos spiked the paper’s planned endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election. As of June, its paid print circulation was just 97,000. On top of that, Johanna Mayer-Jones, WaPo’s ad chief, was reportedly eyeing an exit back in October – although she’s still currently with the company. The decision to focus newsroom layoffs on the sports desk bodes ill for WaPo’s turnaround prospects. Its major news rivals, including The New York Times, have doubled down on sports as a way to attract advertisers that are hesitant about appearing beside hard news coverage. Oh, and the layoffs are expected to hit just as the Winter Olympics are set to begin in February. Stock In Trade The Trade Desk is dealing with all sorts of in-the-weeds programmatic drama. There’s its fierce rivalry with Amazon putting pressure on margins, not to mention in-fighting with Prebid over transaction IDs. But there’s another issue: TTD’s leadership churn. Programmatic vets surely took note of Jud Spencer’s departure in December and CRO Jed Dederick’s exit not long before that. Meanwhile, the COO role was unfilled for years before Vivek Kundra came aboard last year. And there hasn’t been a CTO since Dave Pickles left in 2023. Now, Alex Kayyal, who joined as CFO only six months ago, is stepping down, Adweek reports. TTD also had another CFO transition 18 months prior. The Trade Desk’s CFO turnover may not ring all that loudly in the programmatic space, but Wall Street investors consider it an important signal. And, indeed, TTD’s shares dropped by more than 6% after the announcement. In a research note, Wells Fargo wrote that the news about Kayyal only adds to TTD’s “continued fundamental and narrative volatility.” Losing the narrative, as they say, barely registers in third-party programmatic. Favorable headlines about Amazon DSP can stack to the sky without much affecting TTD’s actual performance. But when the Wall Street narrative breaks, it goes straight to the market cap. The Ads Add Up Few places are pricier to run ads than the Las Vegas Sphere or during an NFL game – unless, apparently, you’re buying a placement in ChatGPT. That’s right. Scarcely a week after OpenAI announced its plan to launch ads in the coming weeks, ChatGPT has reportedly set a baseline CPM of approximately $60, according to The Information. That price rivals some of the most coveted inventory out there. Sixty bucks would be at the high end for a YouTube campaign, while CPMs on Meta, by comparison, are often in the $10 to $20 range. And OpenAI doesn’t even have an attribution or a pixel network to track and credit conversions. On the other hand, recall that Netflix launched with a $60 CPM baseline, which has long since rationalized to $30 or less. Being among the earliest advertisers in ChatGPT will no doubt carry some bragging rights, sure. Just imagine all the screenshots and organic sharing those ads will generate. Still, The Information writes, with OpenAI’s ads business in its infancy, “many advertisers will likely hold off on devoting significant parts of their budgets to ChatGPT ads until they see whether those ads are driving sales.” Not everyone is willing to shell out for a shiny object. But Wait! There’s More! Inside the debate over agentic advertising and standards. [Digiday] How MrBeast Burger, the YouTuber’s eponymous food and delivery brand, went so very wrong.

More from the series → After a rocky 2025, ad tech entities, particularly “independents,” are taking measures to steady the ship in the coming 12 months, with the exit of The Trade Desk’s CFO (its second in six months) the most high-profile example. Earlier this week, The Trade Desk announced the exit of Alex Kayyal, the demand-side platform’s finance chief who has been in role since August 2025 and served on its board from the February prior to that, topping off what’s been a tumultuous 12 months. The Trade Desk’s chief accounting officer Tahnil Davis will serve as interim CFO, while the search for a more permament replacement is conducted. The termination of such a senior executive after a short time in office raises questions – NewStreet Research’s Dan Salmon has a concise analysis – with The Trade Desk’s share price plunging 5% in the early hours after the January 2026 announcement. The departure also echoes similar moves from other DSPs, including layoffs at challengers in the sector such as Yahoo in earlier months, with sources telling Digiday the moves were signs of a financially challenging 2025 for the sector. A November survey from Digiday Research noted the marked rise of Amazon’s DSP, with the results showing that decline of The Trade Desk – dropping from 55% in Q1 2024, to 29% Q3, 2025 – contrasting with the rise of the e-commerce giant’s fortunes – shooting up from 29% to 50% during the same period. Of course, the rise of Amazon contrasting with the rocky fortunes of independent DSPs helps resurface “the Open Internet vs. Wall Gardens” debate, although, a report released this month point to a wind in the sail of the latter. According to a report from Winterberry Group, which characterizes the following 12 months as one of “continuous evolution” as opposed to runaway growth or sudden contraction, with advertising spend projected to grow to $664 billion in 2026, up 9.4% year over year when political advertising is included. However, in a market that is stabilizing after several years of volatility, while also undergoing structural change driven by AI, marketers are being asked to “do more with the same,” per Winterberry’s researchers. All of this means performance advertising will likely be marketers’ cause célèbre in the months ahead as their peers in the finance department ask for immediate results for their marketing investment, making the jobs of sales staff at platform-providers – read Amazon, Google and Meta, etc. – equipped black boxes primed to take further advantage. “According to a reputable leaker on TeamBlind; the layoffs are pushed right one day- i.e. 28 JAN 2026 [sic] is purportedly the new day. Everything else should be consistent/correct.” — As Amazon is expected to follow up on its series of 2025 layoffs, reputedly preparing to cut 30,000 jobs, ahead of its Feb. 5 earnings call, one anonymous source forecasts the precise date the axe will fall. Bold Call: OpenAI’s ads pivot may come too little, too late OpenAI is set to wade into the advertising business this year, but its move to finally monetize ChatGPT with ad dollars may have come a touch too late. The top AI platforms for publishers, ranked Two years after OpenAI signed its first content licensing deal with Axel Springer, the field of AI platforms doing business with publishers has expanded exponentially. Especially just in the past year. OpenAI CFO defends ads in ChatGPT as ‘strong business model’ OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar defended the company’s addition of ads to its popular chatbot ChatGPT as a way to democratize access to artificial intelligence, while speaking at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. YouTube is reaching a ‘tipping point’ in convincing advertisers it really is TV A research study released this month by Pixability found that in a survey of 288 media agency professionals, finding 62% of US agencies and 85% of UK agencies plan to include YouTube in their CTV ad buys this year.

Title: Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos | Analysis
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T21:48:32Z
Full Content:
Rumors of cuts to the international, metro and sports desks are leaving journalists “twisting in the wind” and prompting unusually public appeals to ownership As the Washington Post newsroom braces for layoffs, journalists took their case public on Monday, turning to social media to urge mega-billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to support the paper’s robust and storied foreign coverage. “Hi @JeffBezos,” Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O’Grady wrote on X. “We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team ‘badass beacons of hope.’ We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost.” Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati, who covers Iran for the paper, also tweeted directly to Bezos, saying she wants “nothing more than to keep doing this important work,” while White House bureau chief Matt Viser wrote that “it’s impossible to overstate how much we rely upon” the international desk and “how diminished we’d be without them.” The public appeals on Monday speak to fears inside the paper that significant cuts are on the horizon — particularly in international coverage — and reflect growing doubts about whether Bezos, the Amazon founder reportedly worth around $250 billion, remains fully invested in supporting the paper. The Post, which reportedly lost around $100 million in 2024, went through a painful round of buyouts last year, and staffers worry that further cuts at the start of 2026 could deepen the turmoil at a time when rigorous coverage of global conflict and crisis feels more essential than ever. [Layoffs will] reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” In conversations with TheWrap, staffers expressed frustration with Bezos’ seeming distance from the paper, as well as with CEO and publisher Will Lewis, whose widely touted “third newsroom” initiative never gained traction amid broader upheaval during his two-year tenure. They also fault management for the loss of hundreds of thousands of subscribers after the paper spiked a 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. “If their answer to those losses is to take it out on staff now, what are we doing?” asked a staffer. “The lack of communication has left folks twisting in the wind,” another staffer told TheWrap, adding that “many people aren’t sure if they’ll have jobs next week.” The Post’s precarious state contrasts sharply from a decade ago, when it was among the standout publications during Donald Trump’s first term, with the paper, under then-executive editor Marty Baron, landing major scoops and adopting the motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Even as the Post continues to deliver dogged coverage of Trump’s second administration, Bezos’ cozier relationship with the president and his remaking of the opinion section around “personal liberties and free markets” have raised concerns about whether he remains as committed to holding the administration accountable. It wasn’t lost on staffers that Bezos didn’t publicly comment on the FBI’s search of a Post reporter’s home earlier this month, even as he found time to tweet about Polymarket. At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios reportedly paid $40 million for the licensing rights to a new Melania Trump documentary — which was screened Saturday night at the White House — while Amazon is among the corporate donors to Trump’s ballroom project. Foreign correspondents pleaded with Bezos over the weekend, urging him in a letter to “preserve our newspaper’s global coverage.” They reminded Bezos how he told staff, upon buying the paper in 2013, that being “profitable and shrinking” is “a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.” A third staffer told TheWrap, “If Bezos cares a little bit about this newspaper, and wants this paper to get back to the golden days under the leadership of Marty Baron, then he needs to make changes at the top.” Foreign reporting has long been one of the Post’s hallmarks, stretching back to Pulitzer Prize-winning work by the likes of David Remnick and the late Anthony Shadid, and extending to more recent coverage of ISIS, the Israel-Hamas war, Ukraine, Iran and Venezuela. That legacy is now colliding with deep uncertainty inside the newsroom, where rumors swirl that not only foreign coverage, but sports and metro desk teams are on the chopping block. Potential layoffs on the international desk are particularly unnerving, not only because of the Post’s legacy, but because some foreign journalists rely on the paper for U.S. visas — or to continue reporting from the countries they cover. Proud to be colleagues with fearless @washingtonpost international reporters. @JeffBezos, their work is absolutely core to the newspaper and vitally important to my own job covering the White House and foreign policy. #SaveThePost https://t.co/Q7im59ol9o Foreign correspondents have been told not to travel to crisis zones after Feb. 1, which fueled speculation that management wants U.S.-based staff at home ahead of potential layoffs next month. On Friday, the Post also abruptly canceled plans to send a contingent to cover the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games, which kick off on Feb. 6. Though the specter of layoffs has loomed for some time, “cutting Olympics coverage at the last minute did shock a lot of staff,” the second staffer told TheWrap. “It all feels more serious and urgent now.” TheWrap learned Monday that the Post now plans to send four journalists to the games, as opposed to the more than a dozen originally expected. A Post spokesperson confirmed the Olympics plan. “Perhaps the cuts aren’t as bad as rumored,” added the second staffer. “But if they are, it’ll reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” Turning out the lights on ambitious, hard-hitting international coverage would give a stark new meaning to the Post’s long-standing warning that “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Corbin Bolies contributed reporting for this story.

Title: Washington Post Correspondents Start “Save The Post” Social Media Campaign Amid Fears Of Massive Layoffs

By Ted Johnson Political Editor Staffers at the Washington Post have started to post messages on social media to “Save The Post,” amid fears that the Jeff Bezos-owned publication is on the cusp of implementing massive layoffs. A number of foreign correspondents posted messages Monday as speculation swirled that the international coverage will bear a substantial amount of cuts. A sample: Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati wrote on X, “@jeffbezos I cover Iran for @washingtonpost. Since June, I’ve reported on US/Israeli strikes, a dire water crisis, state coercion of the private sector, and now, horrific govt violence against protesters. I want nothing more than to keep doing this important work.” Correspondent Loveday Morris, who covers the Middle East, wrote, “Today a source warned me that my reporting lines could have me killed. Just an average day as a foreign correspondent. I can’t count the number of times I’ve come under fire or had windows rattle from blasts. Our international staff risk so much to bring home news.” Related Stories News Bari Weiss Unveils Her Strategy For CBS News, Tells Staffers Of Need To Shift To "Streaming Mentality" & To Highlight "Political Friction" Of National Debate News Joe Biden Decries Alex Pretti, Renee Good Shooting Deaths By Federal Agents: "We Are Not A Nation That Guns Down Our Citizens In The Street" The New York Times reported that foreign correspondents sent a letter to Bezos, urging him to retain the coverage. Watch on Deadline The Post has not commented on pending layoffs. “We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and lose relevance,” the correspondents wrote. “… The newsroom depends on our authority, cultivated through face-to-face source meetings around the world — work that simply cannot be replicated from Washington.” There also has been concern about the sports staff at the Post after a memo, obtained by Semafor, went out from Managing Editor Kimi Yoshino informing them that a contingent would not be sent to cover the Winter Olympics next month. A Post spokesperson confirmed a Times report that, in a reversal, a smaller contingent would be sent. The Post has already gone through multiple rounds of job cuts and buyouts in recent years, a contrast from years of growth after Bezos bought the publication in 2013. The Post suffered from a loss of subscribers following Bezos’ decision to nix an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. He later shifted the strategy of the opinion pages, leading to an exodus of editors and columnists. The Amazon founder said that the opinion content would focus on the “defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.” “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote.

Title: Amazon layoffs to begin tomorrow? Key sectors that could be impacted

E-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of layoffs this week, with a broader aim of trimming its corporate workforce by about 30,000, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. In the second round, the total job cuts are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could start as early as Tuesday, 27 January, the people told the news portal. In October last year, the company cut around 14,000 white-collar jobs, nearly half of the 30,000. Employees in Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and the People Experience and Technology HR units are expected to be affected, the report said. However, the full extent of the impact remains unclear, while Amazon's plans could still change. The Seattle-based retailer giant cited the first round of job cuts in October on the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Later, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture," meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. Jassy had previously stated in 2025 that he anticipated Amazon’s corporate workforce would decrease over time due to efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Major companies are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people, the report said. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The entire 30,000 jobs would constitute a small part of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, accounting for nearly 10% of the company's corporate staff. Most of Amazon’s workforce is employed in fulfilment centres and warehouses. It would be the biggest layoff in Amazon’s 30-year history. The company cut around 27,000 jobs in 2022. In October last year, affected workers were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply for internal jobs or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint. Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates.

Title: Job Slaughter Accelerates: January 2026 Corporate Layoffs Signal Economic Implosion

The American economic mirage is shattering. As the nation enters 2026, a chilling corporate offensive is accelerating, transforming the post-holiday landscape into a bloodbath for the working class. This is not a routine economic adjustment; it is the sound of systemic collapse, a coordinated corporate retreat from the very human capital upon which national prosperity was built. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10].

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12].

Title: Jeff Bezos attends Trump movie night as WaPo reporters beg for their jobs: report

Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, attended the premiere of "Melania," a $40 million documentary about the first lady, with President Donald Trump on Saturday night as his reporters begged him not to make steep cuts to the legendary newsroom, according to a new report. David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, reported on Sunday that WaPo's international correspondents sent Bezos a letter pleading with him to maintain the paper's international coverage. The letter was sent as speculation was building that large-scale layoffs were imminent at the paper. "We urge you to consider how these proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable," the letter reads in part. The letter was sent the day after Bezos attended the White House movie night. According to Folkenflik, Melania Trump was paid the "lion's share" of the $40 million licensing fee for Amazon Prime, which is owned by Bezos, to produce the documentary. Trump has become increasingly hostile to the press during his second term. He has called publications that report on his health "illegal" and said they should be shut down.

UFC makes Paramount Plus debut with much-anticipated match When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. UFC 324 live streams will see the much-anticipated Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett match in the main event slot at the T-Mobile Arena, as the two battle it out in Las Vegas for the interim Lightweight Championship in current no. 1 Ilia Topuria's absence – and there's a sneaky way to watch UFC 324 for free. Gaethje has been here before, taking the interim title six years ago at UFC 249. He's tasted defeat three times since that night in Jacksonville, and this might be his last shot at UFC gold. Pimblett, on the other hand, is a star in the rise and the Brit has yet to lose in the organization since his 2021 debut. Can he now add a championship to his vast popularity around the world? This weekend's main card also sees two of UFC's best bantamweights – Sean O'Malley and Song Yadong – return to the Octagon after long layoffs to stake their claim to challenge for Petr Yan's recently re-acquired title. While Natália Silva vs Rose Namajunas headlines the women's action. With Paramount Plus picking up the coverage for the first time in the US, here's where to watch UFC 324 live streams online and from anywhere with a VPN. Exclusive US coverage of the UFC 324 main card is on Paramount Plus. It's being headlined by Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett, which is expected to start at around 11pm ET / 8pm PT. Plans start from only $8.99 a month with the Paramount Plus Essential Plan, or upgrade to Premium for $13.99 a month (see below for more details). You can also get a Paramount Plus trial with Walmart+ as with this sneaky freebie-hacking trick we found. While Paramount Plus will show UFC 324 in its entirety, you can also watch the Early Prelims with the UFC Fight Pass. Traveling outside of the US? Use a VPN to watch Paramount Plus from abroad while you're away from home. Upgrade to Paramount Plus Premium A Paramount Plus Premium subscription gives you access to UFC events, Champions League soccer, 40,000 episodes & movies on demand without ads, Showtime content, and live streams of everything CBS has to offer. Plus, you'll get to watch selected shows and sports in glorious 4K. Go Premium for $13.99 a month or $140 for the whole year This is handy piece of software that can make your device appear as if it's back in your home country, thereby letting you unlock your usual service. The best VPN right now? We recommend NordVPN – it does everything and comes with a 70% discount. 🟩 NordVPN – get the world's best VPNNot having a VPN is like leaving your front door wide open in a busy city – anyone can walk right in and take a peek. TechRadar regularly reviews all the biggest and best VPN providers and NordVPN is our #1 choice. ✅ 70% Off Today✅ 3 Extra Months Free✅ Unlocks Paramount Plus Get NordVPN and stream UFC 324 from anywhere. Using a VPN is incredibly simple: 1. Install the VPN of your choice. As we've said, NordVPN is our favourite. 2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance, if you're visiting the UK and want to view your usual US service, you'd select a United States-based server from the list. 3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to your usual local streaming service and watch the UFC. TNT Sports Box Office has exclusive broadcast rights to UFC 324 in the UK, with the PPV rate set at £19.99. Once ordered, you can watch the event through your choice of Discovery+, Sky, Amazon Prime Video, EE TV or Virgin Media. The main card action is set to begin at 2am GMT on Sunday morning. UFC Fight Pass subscribers can also watch the Prelims and Early Prelims there. If you're abroad whilst the fight is on, a VPN like NordVPN can help you to access your home streaming services from anywhere. There are a host of pay-per-view providers offering a UFC 324 live stream in Canada. You can head to the likes of Sportsnet, Bell or the UFC Fight Pass to watch the whole event, where the PPV price is set at $69.99. Prelims will also be shown on Sportsnet and TVA Sports. North of the border from the US? You can use NordVPN to watch your Paramount Plus subscription like you were back at home. Sunday's Main Card at UFC 324 will be available on PPV in Australia, setting you back AU$59.95 from Foxtel Main Event or Kayo Sports Main Event. That means you can live stream UFC 324 via your web browser and devices like Android, iOS, Samsung TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Telstra TV and Chromecast. You can also catch all the Prelims via Paramount+ and Network 10. Downloading a VPN will help you access your subscriptions from anywhere if you're abroad when the fight is on. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to watch UFC 324 for free. It's on Paramount Plus in the US, which no longer carries a free trial. And it's on PPV in many other countries around the world. The UFC 324 Main Card is scheduled to begin at 9pm ET / 6pm ET on Saturday, January 24. That's 2am GMT or 1pm AEDT in the UK and Australia on Sunday, January 25. Before that, the Early Prelims start at 5pm ET / 2pm PT / 10pm GMT and the Prelims at 7pm PT / 4pm PT / 12am GMT. Yes.

Title: I was laid off from CrowdStrike and used AI to send 800 applications in a month to land my ideal role

Every time Katherine publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike. I went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon. That's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff. I was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a "great résumé." Little did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit. In the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it. At first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked. Instead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called "The Reboot Era," where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences. Even with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, "Should I update my résumé for this role?" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls. LinkedIn "Easy Apply" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked. At first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house. A week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me. Over the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters. With AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast. In total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer. That's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase. AI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person. I think the job market is going in the wrong direction. First, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand. If the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions. None of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back. Jump to

Every time Pranav publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes. The company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October. In the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed. The focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous "two-pizza rule," originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group. As the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. One meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption "how we feed two pizza teams." Another image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption "did someone say 2 pizza team?" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land. "I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal," one employee wrote in the Slack channel. "Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage." Others wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered "reasonably sized." "I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas," another employee wrote. The pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes. One riffed on the rumored timing, splashing "JANUARY 27TH" over the scene from "The Shining" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and "AWS" over his face. Another meme used the "panik/kalm" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words "Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble. Other posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: "able to login," "mail and Slack works," and "no random HR meeting in calendar." Another simply captured the vibe in all caps: "I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask." Amazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees. Have a tip?

Title: 'We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great,' says Meta execs regarding Quest changes

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth went on a series of interviews this week, detailing what's next for Meta Quest headsets, VR gaming, and the company's quest for the Metaverse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In a move that will have lots of Meta Quest gamers screaming "HALLELUJAH," Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth announced that the company would be paring back its investments into the VR version of Horizon Worlds, a Roblox-like metaverse, and focusing its efforts on smartphone gamers, instead. Meta is even removing Horizon Feed from headsets starting with the next Meta Quest software update, v85. Bosworth went on several interviews this week at Davos, a World Economic Forum summit, detailing Meta's next steps for its Reality Labs division. Last week, Meta laid off 1,500 Reality Labs staff and announced the closure of most of its first-party development studios without any official announcement, causing speculation that the company was done with VR. Bosworth told Axios, "we had this integrated concept of where Horizon and VR were the same thing....That is a real challenging piece of work to land. There's lots of people who put this headset on for different reasons. You want to support all those different use cases. The lack of focus comes at the expense of user experience and a great expense at development cost." Nearly two years ago, Meta made moves to more deeply integrate Meta Quest headsets with the company's Horizon Worlds metaverse. The Meta Quest store became the Meta Horizon store, and free-to-play Horizon Worlds content was prominently placed in front of users instead of more traditional gaming content. The result was a substantial decline in game sales on the Quest, backed up by tons of developer data to prove it. Many on social media are saying the changes are too little, too late. Several development studios have announced closures lately, some citing broader challenges across the video game market, while others have attributed them specifically to the VR market. Even developers of games that regularly stay in the top-20 best-sellers have announced layoffs. Allegedly, more are also on the way. "We're going to let VR be what it is and what it does great," Bosworth continued. "We're going to focus a lot more on the third-party content library and ecosystem that has developed there." But according to several interviews I conducted after Meta's studio closures on January 13, 2026, Meta let go of several staff who worked with third-party developers and reduced funding to programs like Oculus Publishing. Bosworth wasn't asked about this topic in either of the Davos interviews, but has so far failed to comment publicly when asked on social media. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Heath's interview with Bosworth revealed that Meta is "still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we (Meta) hoped." We saw this trend begin in mid-2025, although the Christmas holiday period saw the Meta Quest outsell even the Nintendo Switch 2 on Amazon. Even with that success and the success of several new games, Meta looks to be shifting priorities away from first-party development. As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, said on social media, "Oculus had a strong internal mandate to NOT be Nintendo and instead build things that build the ecosystem. Returning to that is good." "This is not a disaster," Palmer followed up with. Meta "still employs the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close."

Title: The System Is Starting To Crack – Home Prices Plummet As Silver Hits $100 And Gold Closes In On $5,000

Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? There are all sorts of signs that the relentless pressure that has been causing an enormous amount of stress on our financial system is starting to break things. Do you remember how bad things got in 2008 and 2009 when home prices fell dramatically? Well, as you will see below, it is beginning to happen again. Meanwhile, the price of silver and the price of gold both just keep setting brand new record high after brand new record high. That is music to the ears of many of my readers, but for large financial institutions that are holding enormous short positions that has the potential to be absolutely catastrophic. I think that we will be shocked by how violently things start to break loose in the financial system in the months ahead. For decades, those that pull the financial strings in the western world were able to keep the price of silver and the price of gold within ranges that they considered to be acceptable. But now everything has changed. A year ago, nobody was predicting that the price of silver would hit $100 and the price of gold would nearly reach $5,000 in just 12 months. But that is precisely what has occurred… Silver prices rose above $100 an ounce ​for the first time ever on Friday, while gold hit another record en route ‌to $5,000/oz as investors pile into safe-haven assets amid geopolitical turmoil and on expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts. The price of silver is up more than 200 percent over the past year. When there are swings of this magnitude, there are really big winners and really big losers. I think that the identities of the really big losers will start to be revealed soon, and this will shock the financial world to the core. In previous articles, I have gone over many of the reasons why the price of silver has been skyrocketing. But there is one more theory that I wanted to throw out there today. Zero Hedge is reporting that demand in China is “off the charts”, and not too long ago the Chinese implemented severe restrictions on silver exports. Could it be possible that China is purposely attempting to destabilize the western financial system? The Chinese know that there are very large institutions that have massive short positions, and if they can force those institutions to fail that would cause enormous chaos in the U.S. and Europe. If that really is their motive, that would explain a lot. It is very interesting that silver has hit $100 at the exact same moment when gold is almost reaching the $5,000 milestone. Both of those marks are key psychological thresholds, and nobody is quite sure what is going to happen next… Gold approaching $5,000 and silver approaching $100 represent more than incremental price advances. These levels function as psychological thresholds where attention concentrates, behavior changes, and market structure briefly dominates narrative. In market terms, these prices act as an event horizon. The concept is borrowed deliberately. In physics, the event horizon marks the point beyond which outcomes are no longer observable in advance. In trading, it marks the price level that forces participation. Opinions polarize, positioning compresses, and conviction gives way to reaction. These numbers draw in new participants on both sides of the market. Buyers include momentum participants who believe higher prices are inevitable, as well as short positions forced to cover under pressure. Sellers include long holders who have never experienced these prices and view the opportunity to monetize as both rational and psychologically satisfying. Selling silver at $100 or gold at $5,000 carries narrative weight regardless of future direction. Some are convinced that these key psychological thresholds will propel gold and silver to new heights. Others are convinced that these thresholds will act as “ceilings” and gold and silver will start bouncing in the other direction. We shall see what happens. As I write this, the price of silver has just hit $102. I am looking at that number and I can see that it is real, but I am still having a hard time believing it. It is truly difficult to comprehend the pace at which things are now changing. As precious metals soar, home prices all over the United States are starting to fall precipitously… Florida, Texas and California are now firmly at the center of America’s housing crash – accounting for 12 of the 14 major metro areas where home prices are falling. The sharpest drop was recorded in Dallas, TX, where median sale prices slid 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Florida’s once-red-hot housing market is also cracking, with prices falling in Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. California has four declining metros as well, including Oakland, with the second-biggest drop of 5.6 percent, San Jose, Sacramento and Los Angeles. On the one hand, this is good news because home prices had become wildly unaffordable. But on the other hand, if home prices fall too rapidly that will be a very bad thing. Let’s not forget what happened during 2008 and 2009. When housing prices crashed, millions of mortgages were suddenly underwater and foreclosures went through the roof. In previous articles, I have talked about the fact that the number of foreclosures was way up last year. If we are on the leading edge of another giant tsunami of foreclosures, that will be absolutely disastrous for our banking system. Meanwhile, pending home sales just dropped “to the lowest level for any December on record”… Pending home sales, which track the number of contracts signed in December, plunged by 9.3% seasonally adjusted from November, to the lowest level for any December on record in the data by the National Association of Realtors, which goes back to 2010. Compared to December 2010, during the Housing Bust, pending sales were down by 21.5%. The market is now well into its fourth year of the collapse in transactions, and there has simply been no improvement. That is a really bad sign. Unfortunately, demand is likely to continue to be weak for quite some time because we continue to see mass layoffs all over the nation. For example, Amazon is gearing up for another round of layoffs which could end up being the largest in the entire history of the company… Amazon is planning to cut thousands of jobs as part of a broader push to eliminate nearly 10% of its corporate workforce, according to Reuters. After initially cutting roughly 14,000 white-collar jobs in October, Amazon is expected to launch a second round of layoffs impacting a similar number of employees, with an overall target of about 30,000 jobs, although the scope may change, according to two sources cited by Reuters. If fully realized, the cuts would amount to the largest layoffs in Amazon’s history, surpassing the roughly 27,000 jobs the company cut in 2022. So many good paying jobs are being lost. And this is the worst time since the Great Recession to find a new good paying job. In so many ways, it is starting to feel like 2008 all over again. Earlier today, I heard from a reader that explained that my articles really resonate with him because of what he has been going through. That meant a lot to me. I know that so many of you are really struggling right now. I want you to know that it isn’t your fault. Decades of incredibly bad decisions by our leaders have brought us to this point, and now the entire system is starting to fail. We should have fundamentally transformed the system after the Great Recession, but we didn’t. Instead, our leaders chose to inflate all of the old bubbles even larger than before, and now we have a colossal mess on our hands.

Title: Business Leaders Suddenly Fearful as Anger Surges Over AI Replacing Human Jobs

Time Published: 2026-01-23T20:02:45Z

By Joe Wilkins Published Jan 23, 2026 3:02 PM EST It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had. Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution. At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.” “We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted. Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor. It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs. In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026. The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy. Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

Title: Amazon May Announce Thousands of Corporate Job Cuts Next Week

Amazon is reportedly preparing to announce thousands of corporate job cuts next week, Reuters is reporting today. The company already laid off 14,000 corporate employees in late October, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hinted at the time that more job cuts would be coming due to “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Reuters previously reported in October that Amazon was planning to get rid of 30,000 corporate workers in total, and this new round of layoffs is expected to affect AWS, retail, and HR units. Amazon had already laid off 27,000 employees at the beginning of 2023 to adjust to the post-pandemic era. “Jobs in the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was unclear. The people cautioned that the details of Amazon’s plans could change,” the Reuters report reads. Amazon currently employs over 1.55 million employees worldwide, with approximately 350,000 corporate jobs before the first round of layoffs was announced in October. As Jassy previously said, Amazon is all-in on generative AI and agents, and the exec encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever you can” and learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Image: Amazon Amazon is reportedly set to launch a second round of job cuts next week as it works toward a goal of trimming 30,000 corporate employees. According to a report from Reuters, this new wave could begin as early as Tuesday and is expected to be similar in scale to the 14,000 white-collar roles eliminated this past October. Sources familiar with the matter say the reductions will likely impact units including Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and human resources. The total reduction represents nearly 10 per cent of the company’s corporate workforce. While Amazon employs over 1.5 million people, the majority work in fulfillment centres and were not targeted in this specific round of cuts. While internal documents previously tied the October cuts to the power of artificial intelligence, CEO Andy Jassy later suggested the move was about fixing company culture. Jassy told analysts that the firm had developed too many layers of bureaucracy and management. Despite this, Jassy has noted that AI efficiencies will likely continue to shrink the corporate headcount over time as routine tasks become automated. This downsizing marks the largest layoff period in the company’s three-decade history, exceeding the 27,000 jobs cut in 2022. For those let go in the previous wave, a 90-day grace period on the payroll is scheduled to expire this Monday.

Title: Gates Foundation plans to give away $9 billion in 2026 to prepare for the 2045 closure while slashing hundreds of jobs
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/gates-foundation-budgets-9-billion-job-cuts-what-it-means-for-philanthropy/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T17:31:23Z
Full Content:
Conventional wisdom tells us all good things must come to an end. And that’s what the Gates Foundation is preparing for. Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates told Fortune first about their plans to shutter their $86 billion charitable foundation in 2045. (French Gates is no longer part of the foundation, having stepped down in 2024 from her role following the couple’s divorce. She now runs her own foundation, Pivotal Philanthropies, focused on gender equality and global health.) This year, the Gates Foundation will spend a record $9 billion and cut as many as 500 staff jobs during the next five years as the world’s largest private foundation plans to shutter. The foundation’s motivation for its move is to accelerate giving to global health, poverty, and education, helping beneficiaries take ambitious bets now rather than maintaining operations indefinitely. These moves underscore how one of the defining philanthropic institutions of this century is reconfiguring for its sunsetting era. The Gates Foundation’s move to spend down raises questions about who will fill its proverbial shoes. Perhaps it will be a figure like MacKenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has donated $26 billion to thousands of organizations in just the past five years. The Gates Foundation’s board approved the largest budget in its 25-year history at $9 billion, a decision coming less than a year after Gates said the institution would close its doors by Dec. 31, 2045, and spend down roughly $200 billion over two decades. As part of the Giving Pledge, Gates has promised to give away about 99% of his fortune, calling the accelerated timeline a response to “pressing” global problems that can’t wait for traditional giving procedures. The foundation has already distributed more than $100 billion since its inception, becoming a dominant funder in global health, vaccines, and antipoverty work, and an outsize player in U.S. K-12 education. The board also approved the foundation’s recommendation to increase the budgets of several programs for this year, ranging from women’s health to AI in U.S. education. To hit its 2045 deadline while increasing its grantmaking, the Gates Foundation will cut up to 500 of its roughly 2,375 staff positions by 2030—about 20% of its headcount—through attrition and layoffs, according to a Jan. 14 press release. The board also approved a cap on operating costs, limiting overhead such as salaries, infrastructure, facilities, and travel to no more than $1.25 billion, or roughly 14% of the total budget. “While progress is possible, it remains fragile, and delivering on our mandate requires a commitment to move forward with transparency for our employees and partners and disciplined stewardship of the foundation’s finite resources,” Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation, said in a statement. He added that the reductions will be gradual and reviewed annually, rather than a one-time wave, as the organization shifts more dollars from operations into grants. Gates’ decision to sunset the foundation firmly places it in the “time-limited” camp, which is starting to gain traction among other modern mega-donors who argue that hoarding capital in perpetuity doesn’t work in today’s society. One other example is Scott, who has already donated $26 billion since 2020 to thousands of charities and has repeatedly helped organizations facing federal funding cuts. In 2025, Scott issued three lifelines to organizations in the aftermath of federal funding cuts, including a $45 million gift to the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ youth crisis organization. “This historic donation from MacKenzie Scott comes at a time when the Trevor Project has never needed it more,” Jaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, said in a statement shared with Fortune. “LGBTQ+ youth in the U.S. are facing a growing mental health crisis, and the resources they have for support continue to be politicized and jeopardized.” In 2025, Scott also made a $60 million donation to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy just as the Trump administration moved to slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an organization Americans rely on for help during and after hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and floods. Scott also donated $80 million to historically Black college Howard University—a gift that came at an “opportune time,” helping the HBCU weather a federal government shutdown that delayed annual appropriations supporting student success, research, and hospital donations. Scott is also a prime example of someone in the billionaire class who is actively attempting to share as much of her wealth as possible instead of holding on to it forever. For nonprofits focused on global health and development, the Gates announcement is a double-edged sword. It means more money will be disbursed in the near term, but it also sets a firm expiration date on one of the organizations they rely on the most. Many of the foundation’s biggest bets—from vaccines and disease eradication to agricultural innovation—often require long lead times and coordination with governments and other organizations. This raises the question of what happens after 2045. As the Gates Foundation continues its 20-year shutdown process, pressure will grow on peers, like tech billionaires and next-gen heirs, to either step in to help or face questions of why they’re not doing enough. French Gates recently said there’s more the ultrawealthy can do. While more than 250 of the world’s wealthiest have signed the pledge, many have so far failed to live up to it. “Have they given enough? No,” French Gates said in an interview with Wired published in December. “We’re trying to demonstrate for them: Go big. You can go big, you can go bold.”

Title: 2026 layoffs news: Which companies are planning job cuts as Amazon is set to trim workforce? Check details

With just over 20 days into 2026, several companies are already planning job cuts. Major companies, including Amazon, aim to cut thousands of corporate jobs across various divisions, potentially marking its largest layoffs yet. Ericsson plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs in Sweden to stay competitive, while FedEx will cut 500 jobs in France but also create new positions. Citigroup and BlackRock have announced significant layoffs. Here's a list of companies planning layoffs recently — E-commerce giant Amazon is set to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week as part of its workforce reduction strategy, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two people familiar with the matter. These layoffs, possibly the company's largest, are expected to affect white-collar roles across divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video, and retail. However, the report indicated that the plans might change. Telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson, earlier this month, announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at maintaining the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. The company expects to continue laying off employees as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Reuters quoted Ekholm during a post-earnings call. On Friday, US parcel delivery company FedEx announced a strategic overhaul of its French domestic operations, including a plan to cut up to 500 jobs and invest about 78 million euros ($91.58 million). FedEx plans to streamline its internal structure by cutting its station count from 103 to 86. This move aims to simplify the distribution network and eliminate unnecessary infrastructure across the country. Although job cuts are part of the plan, the reorganisation is also expected to create over 770 new full-time and part-time roles. FedEx stated that employees affected by layoffs would be given priority consideration for these new positions. Banking giant Citigroup is expected to lay off approximately 1,000 employees this month as CEO Jane Fraser aims to reduce costs and boost returns. The current round of job cuts at Citigroup is part of the company's plan, which was announced two years ago, to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, according to a Bloomberg report citing people aware of the development. The Metropolitan Opera of New York announced a round of layoffs on Tuesday as it struggles financially, despite having implemented other significant cost-cutting measures over the past five years, according to a report by The New York Times. Met announced additional cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its highest-paid employees and delaying a new production scheduled for the upcoming season. According to the report, the opera house will reduce its administrative staff by 22, decreasing the total from 284 to approximately 262, which is about 10% of the division's workforce. BlackRock earlier this month said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, Bloomberg reported. According to a report citing people familiar with the development, BlackRock will lay off about 1% of its workforce, or about 250 employees across divisions.

The Shareholders Are Hungry: They must feast on livelihoods! And bones! And they demand more! More! More! Amazon is planning to cut thousands more corporate jobs next week, according to a report by Reuters. Back in October, Amazon trimmed 14,000 jobs. The plan, supposedly, has been to cut around 30,000 jobs. Why? Not because of artificial intelligence, or earnings, but "culture," as per CEO Andy Jassy. Too many people? Too much bureaucracy.

Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton has introduced a bill that would bar anybody who became an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer during Donald Trump's second term from ever becoming a law enforcement officer in Washington. "I don’t want people that are trained in that culture to come and infiltrate our culture," Simmons said. Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, is the only other sponsor of the bill. The Weather: Another crisp, sunny day. Meanwhile, seemingly everyone else in the country is going to get rocked by a dramatic winter storm. Texas and Oklahoma are preparing for snow! The storm will stretch from the southern Rockies up through New England. You know who is not included in that? Us. It's so lonely in this mild winter. Though, maybe I should be grateful. Dozens of states have issued states of emergency in advance of the oncoming storm. White House Uses AI-altered Photo as Propaganda: The Justice Department arrested demonstrator Nekima Levy Armstrong for the crime of interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota because of the pastor's alleged ties to ICE. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo of Armstrong's arrest to X. In it, Armstrong looked calm, composed, stoic. Later, the White House posted its own photo showing Armstrong open-mouthed sobbing, tears streaming down her face. The picture was manipulated with generative AI tools. In a response to questions about the doctored photo, Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director for the White House, said, “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.” This is the first example I’ve seen of an American government using AI to meaningfully misrepresent actual events with the intent to deceive the public. We are at Stalinesque levels of propaganda. donmoynihan.substack.com/p/past-the-b...[image or embed] There's a Big Game This Weekend: The Seahawks will play in the NFC Championship game in Seattle on Sunday. As the old adage goes: Fuck the Rams. Minnesota on Strike: The Day of Truth & Freedom general strike is on in Minnesota this Friday. To protest the ICE killing of Renee Good, Minnesotans are participating in a "no work, no school, no shopping" blackout. It's been endorsed by the Minneapolis City Council. Businesses around the state are shutting down in solidarity. The demands of the action are simple: ICE needs to GTFO, Jonathan Ross—the agent who killed Good—needs to be held accountable, Congress needs to stop federal funding for ICE, and there needs to be an investigation into the agency's actions. JD Vance Pins Blames on Minnesota Officials: Vice President, expectant father, and couch lover JD Vance told the press that the one thing that would "lower the temperature" in Minnesota is if local officials cooperated with federal law enforcement by "helping ICE identify and arrest violent criminals so that the operation could be more targeted," as The Guardian reports. In fact, the federal government suspects Minnesota officials are conspiring to impede federal efforts in the state. The US Justice Department subpoenaed local officials like Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week to investigate these conspiring claims. Walz called it "political theater." Good's Autopsy: Renee Good's autopsy—which was commissioned by her family—showed she was shot four times. Once in the forearm, once in the right breast, and once in her head near the left temple. That bullet exited through the right side of her head. She also sustained a graze wound. Why the fuck did that man shoot her at close range four times? Everyone Has a Role in Resistance: A Minnesota man offered up his screen printing talents and studio to help stand up to ICE. You don’t know your role yet maybe, but we are all finding out just what we have to offer. In Minneapolis, one man knew immediately what he could offer and said “Bring me your clothing”.[image or embed] Deuces: Trump has officially pulled the US out of the World Health Organization since the organization is, as he says, "straying from its core mission." That's surely a sign of our country's good health, right? Good News for Brainrot: TikTok finalized a deal to create an American entity, a move that circumvents the national security concerns that threatened a ban of the app. US investors in the new joint venture include Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. President Donald Trump praised the deal, thanked China's President Xi, and said he hopes, "that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok." Hell Is Also Elsewhere: Wildfires are raging in Chile. They've gobbled up record 45,700 hectares of forest which is the equivalent of a 176 square miles. The fires have killed 21 people so far. While firefighters are trying to stop the blazes, people are trying to hurt them. There have been two attacks on firefighting brigades—one of which included gunfire (it's unclear why they were attacked). Plus, arsonists are having a field day. At least 70 people have been arrested for setting or attempting to set new fires this fire season. A Food Review: Have you seen the ads for the new Applebee's cheeseburger sitting open-faced in a pile of cheese? This man has. "The O-M-Cheeseburger, the purest distillate of Americana yet produced." Queer Bait: The straight ex-hockey player brothers behind the hockey podcast "Empty Netters" are in hot water after publicly praising the steamy gay hockey show Heated Rivalry but bashing it in private. Their episodes praising Heated Rivalry have hundreds of thousands of more streams than their regular content. The hosts, realizing the grift at their disposal, started hawking Heated Rivalry t-shirts. Too bad they actually hate the show. A Song for your Friday: Marty Supreme gave me a new appreciation for this song. Sad that the soundtrack was snubbed from the Oscar nominations, but ya can't win 'em all, right? Which is probably one of Marty Supreme's themes. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger.

Title: Employee Works At A Company That Earned Millions In Revenue, So He Was Disappointed When He Learned What Kind Of Reward Employees Were Getting

by Heide Lazaro Freepik/Reddit Company success should be shared with the entire organization. The following story involves a man working at a small company. The company proudly announced it reached tens of millions in revenue. Because of this, all employees will be getting some sort of “reward.” Read the full story below and find out more. This should be short and sweet. The company I work for proudly announced that it made tens of millions of pounds in revenue this year. We exceeded our revenue goals by millions. We’re a small company with less than 100 employees. This man learned that he and his colleagues will be getting an Amazon gift card. Yesterday, our office manager proudly announced that we’d all be getting a £25 Amazon gift card. I’ve heard of these things happening. I even joked during the revenue announcement that the layoffs would be next. I still didn’t think the ironic skinflint move would happen to me. Wow! What a tempting reward! lol Let’s see how others reacted. We live in a sad, greedy world, says this one. Short and simple. Finally, this one got a blanket and a chocolate. Nothing says “we smashed our goals” quite like a gift card that barely covers lunch. If you liked that story, check out this post about an oblivious CEO who tells a web developer to “act his wage”… and it results in 30% of the workforce being laid off.

When Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs in October, it warned that more layoffs were coming in 2026. According to Reuters, that round is set to begin next week and, once again, will sweep away thousands of jobs. The exact number of job cuts in the latest round is unclear, but sources tell Reuters it could be on par with the last round as part of Amazon’s broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs. Departments expected to take a hit include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Prime Video, human resources, and retail. Although 30,000 represents a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million global workforce, it accounts for 10% of its corporate staff, the report adds. Most other employees work in warehouses and fulfillment centers. In October, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the layoffs weren’t driven by financial struggles or AI development. “It’s culture,” he noted. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, said in a memo to employees that "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and...we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." In a June memo to workers, meanwhile, Jassy warned that generative AI and AI agents would change the way people work at Amazon. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Which departments will get affected as e-commerce giant cuts jobs?

US-based tech and e-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of job cuts next week, as part of its broader goal of trimming its workforce by 30,000, according to news agency Reuters. In October last year, the company slashed around 14,000 white-collar jobs, which accounted for roughly half of Amazon's 30,000 target. This time though, the total layoffs are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the agency report said. The reduction in roles will impact multiple departments across the Jeff Bezos-owned company. This marks one of the major layoffs happening at the start of the new year, indicating that last year's job-cut spree has continued into 2026. The mass layoffs are expected to impact employees who are serving in the company's Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources divisions, known as People Experience and Technology, said people aware of the development, although the full scope remains unclear. The sources further cautioned that the plan is not yet final, and the details could change, the agency reported. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon’s workers are employed in fulfillment centers and warehouses. This move would also mark the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The last time it trimmed such a massive number of jobs was in 2022, where around 27,000 employees were affected. During the job cuts in October, the online retailer cited the rise of artificial intelligence software as a key reason for the decision. However, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Jassy also noted that “it’s culture,” meaning the company has too much bureaucracy, referring to the layoffs. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he added. He had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to undergo a reduction over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the integration of AI in its workforce. Corporations are rapidly integrating AI into their software development lifecycles, moving beyond simple code autocompletion to adopting autonomous AI agents that can plan, execute, and debug code. This shift is driven by the need for increased productivity, cost reduction, and faster outputs, according to multiple reports.

Title: Ericsson layoffs: CEO Borje Ekholm says telecom giant to continue job cuts amid 5G market woes

Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson expects to continue laying off employees as part of its ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Ekholm was quoted as saying in a post-earnings call by Reuters. Earlier this year, Ericsson announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at ensuring the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. These cost-saving measures have helped the company maintain profitability and deliver strong earnings, even as telecom operators continue to witness sluggish demand in the global 5G equipment market. In mid-January, Ericsson submitted a notice to the Swedish Public Employment Service, stating that approximately 1,600 positions could be impacted in the country. It also initiated negotiations with relevant trade unions. The telecom equipment maker has been working to cut costs and improve margins in recent years. The company struggled with weak demand, as anticipated carrier spending on 5G technology did not meet expectations, Mint reported earlier. Ericsson has been steadily reducing headcount over the last three years to maintain profitability as it grappled with 5G spending slowdown and the widespread impact of sweeping US tariffs. In 2023, the company announced a global plan to cut 8,500 jobs, equivalent to 8% of its workforce. The reductions have continued since then, with the company axing hundreds of staff in Spain and Canada last year. Ericsson is not the first company to reduce its headcount, as at least five other major companies have also announced layoffs in January this year, reflecting a broader trend of cost-cutting across the corporate sector. The job-loss trend that companies struggled with the previous year seems to have continued into the new year as well. Earlier, BlackRock said it planned to cut hundreds of jobs this month, after Meta announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the Digital Labs division. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report also said Meta's job cuts are expected later this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Banking major Citigroup is also about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company, Mint reported. In a more recent instance, Amazon also announced that it plans to slash around 30,000 white-collar jobs by next week. It said the layoffs may impact AWS, HR, Prime Video and retail segments of the company. However, the plans may still change, said a Mint report.

Title: I landed a job at Snap after guessing the recruiter's email address. Here's my advice for other recent graduates looking for tech roles.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me. I was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires. I also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech. It felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone. Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Given these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group. That's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances. In job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us. Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. In early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted. However, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates. My goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial. I eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version. I could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more. Fortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role. Within a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer. That was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day. By March, I had received and accepted an offer for the software engineering role. I started at Snap in August 2023 and am now a machine learning engineer. One thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on. My top pieces of advice for other job seekers are: I'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road. Additionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.

Δ These cuts will be part of the second round of a broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs, and they will follow the first round that involved 14,000 layoffs in October, Reuters reported Thursday (Jan. 22), citing unnamed sources. The latest round is likely to impact four Amazon business units: Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, which is the firm’s human resources division, according to the report. The full scope of the layoffs is not known, and the plans could change, per the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Reuters report, the 30,000 jobs that Amazon plans to cut under this plan would amount to only a small portion of the company’s 1.58 million employees but 10% of its corporate workforce. It would also follow Amazon’s elimination of 27,000 jobs in 2022. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It was reported in October, just before the first round of the latest wave of layoffs, that Amazon planned to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs as part of an effort to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and the number of managers at the company. About a year earlier, in September 2024, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online. When the company began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said Amazon had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Thousands of corporate jobs on chopping block as giant seeks to trim workforce by 30,000 — All we know

American tech and e-commerce giant Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week, as part of its plan to trim its workforce by 30,000, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two sources familiar with the matter. These layoffs — among the company's largest — are likely to impact white-collar roles across divisions, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video and retail, it added. Sources added that the plans could change. In October last year, Amazon culled 14,000 white-collar jobs (around half of its target of 30,000), and is expected to do the same this year, as per the sources. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment, the report added. According to a Bloomberg report, as of September 2025, Amazon had around 1.57 million employees — a majority of whom worked in its warehouses. Its corporate workforce comprised around 3,50,000 people, it added. The Reuters report added that 30,000 cuts would be 10% of the company's corporate workforce. Notably, this would be Amazon's largest layoff in 30 years, after it cut 27,000 roles in 2022. Those laid off in October were given 90 days on payroll to either seek jobs externally or find other roles internally. This period expires on 26 January 2026 (Monday), it added. The Reuters report added that the Seattle-based online retailer's job cuts in October were tied to increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. It cited an internal memo which stated: “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, later during the company's Q3 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts that the cuts were not AI-driven or financially driven, but rather due to “culture”. He added, “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers”. In 2025, Jassy said he expected the company's corporate workforce to reduce as AI efficiencies increase. The Reuters report added that to save costs, corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks. Amazon's AWS itself touted its latest AI models during its annual cloud computing conference in December.

The company in October cut some 14,000 white-collar jobs, about half of the 30,000 target first reported by Reuters. The total this time is expected to be roughly the same as last year and could begin as soon as Tuesday, the people said, who asked not to be identified because they were ​not authorized to discuss Amazon’s plans. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Jobs ⁠in the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video and human resources, known as People Experience and Technology, units are slated to be affected, the people said, though the full scope was ​unclear. The people cautioned that ⁠the details of Amazon’s plans could change. The Seattle online retailer tied the October round of job cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI ‌is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s ‌enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call ‍that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture,” meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. “You end up with ‍a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he said. Jassy had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to shrink over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its ⁠latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion ​of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the firm’s corporate workforce. The majority ⁠of Amazon’s workers are in fulfillment centers and warehouses. It would be the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022. Affected workers in October were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply ⁠for jobs internally or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday.

Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000. The latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture. Amazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters earlier reported this latest round of cuts could come as early as next week. Have a tip?
