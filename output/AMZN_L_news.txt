This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → U.S. advertising spending is now forecast to grow 6.6% next year — that’s not taking into account political ad spend that occurred in 2025 — down from an estimated 11% in the past 12 months, according to the latest analysis from Madison & Wall. The findings are reflected in a similar global forecast from media consultancy Ebiquity, which found that almost half (48%) of marketers expect to increase their media spend next year, with digital video and CTV likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, sources predict this moderate growth is most likely to be concentrated in a few hands, with the titans of Silicon Valley on course to benefit most from this trend. Per Madison & Wall’s revised assessment, programmatic spend follows stronger-than-expected performance in 2025 and reflects a moderation in growth rather than a downturn. For programmatic advertising, the forecast points to continued expansion in automated buying, concentrated in digital formats that deliver measurable performance, while much of the open internet — that includes independent ad tech — is under intense pressure to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. The upgrade comes after another strong quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% year over year in Q3 2025, excluding political spending, the fastest quarterly pace since early 2022 (see chart). Digital advertising increased 21%, raising digital’s share of total ad spend to 72%, with the forecast underscoring the continued dominance of channels with first-party data, closed-loop measurement, and AI-driven optimization. Looking ahead, Madison & Wall expects economic conditions to remain broadly supportive in 2026, despite rising policy and geopolitical risks. Consensus forecasts point to real GDP growth of roughly 1.8% and inflation near 2.8%, implying nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5%. While the correlation between economic growth and advertising has weakened, the firm views nominal growth as a meaningful reference point for advertising demand. It expects advertising growth to slow gradually rather than correct sharply. Within that environment, programmatic advertising is expected to increase its share of open internet transactions. Madison & Wall forecasts programmatic revenues across the open internet to grow 4.4% in 2026, with programmatic accounting for 74% of open internet ad revenues. Growth is expected to be driven by programmatic connected TV, digital out-of-home, and digital audio, each projected to grow at double-digit rates as automation expands across newer digital formats. However, total open internet advertising revenues are expected to be roughly flat. Programmatic growth in 2026 is therefore driven primarily by a shift in buying methods rather than an expansion of overall spend. Programmatic revenues tied to digital platforms and publishers are expected to decline slightly, reflecting ongoing pricing pressure and uneven demand outside large-scale platforms. In his end-of-year assessment, W Media Research‘s Karsten Weide remarked how much of the ad tech ecosystem on the open internet was in open conflict, highlighting how the Q3 dispute of transaction IDs, or “TIDs,” between buy- and sell-side players is an open wound. “What once sounded like a technical dispute over wrappers and auction mechanics has escalated into a power struggle over who governs the open internet,” he noted. By contrast, closed digital platforms are expected to continue to capture a disproportionate share of incremental spending. Madison & Wall forecasts commerce media to grow 16% in 2026, social media 15%, and search 8%. The firm expects ad tech platforms to introduce additional AI-powered buying tools designed to replicate the automated, outcome-focused buying models already prevalent within walled gardens. Madison & Wall further noted how advertisers are placing greater emphasis on price and performance, often at the expense of transparency and control, with spend increasingly directed toward platforms that bundle creative, optimization, and measurement within the cost of inventory. Direct relationships between advertisers and large media owners continue to expand; this is a trend that reduces reliance on agency-managed buying systems, with Madison & Wall expecting AI to enhance this trend as more workflow tools are made available in the industry. Meanwhile, search and commerce advertising are expected to remain structurally resilient, while publishers across the open internet face greater pressure to adapt their business models. In that context, programmatic advertising continues to function as a core transaction layer — growing in importance, but operating within a more constrained overall market. “If I have the opportunity to leave, I’m leaving. Omnicom is NOT competitive in my eyes. Their benefits suck and they are moving away from creative driven [sic] work and focusing on data driven [sic] work and pumping out as much content as possible.” — An Omnicom staff member speaks truth to power on the gift that keeps on giving, i.e., the OmnicomIPGmerger subreddit, while others use other threads to estimate that the layoffs are not even halfway done. From the 2026 Integral Ad Science Industry Pulse Report: WPP estimates commerce media spending to overtake TV this year The company’s latest global ad spend forecasts predict that commerce media will account for 15.6% of global ad spend in 2025, compared with the 14.6% spent on linear and connected TV. The case against AI agents for programmatic ad buying Christopher Francia, director of product development and client performance at Attention Arc explains discusses whether or not AI agents be involved in programmatic ad buys. Plot spoiler: “We’re not trusting that to large language model-based agents.” Google tells advertisers it’ll bring ads to Gemini in 2026 Google has said to advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its AI chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations, according to Adweek’s Trishla Ostwal. AI brings MFA to social media… how advertisers can avoid it Zefr CEO Rich Raddon argues that generative AI has led to the re-emergence of an unwelcome visitor from the past for most advertisers. X shuts down EU’s ad account after first major DSA fine The European Commission issued a €120 million fine to X — its first fine issued under the Digital Services Act (DSA) following prior allegations. Following the fine and a public response from X CEO Elon Musk, X shut down the Commission’s ad account. Advertiser battles Google, alleges failure to disclose queries “Google prioritizes profit over integrity by using its Google Ads program to deceive its customers, primarily small businesses, out of their hard-earned money,” the advertiser argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Case Pitts in San Jose. “Since 2020, Google has accomplished this grift, by hiding a significant portion of its client charges inside an impenetrable ‘black box’ that not even Houdini could open.” Corporate development sources estimate the deal valuation to be above $300 million, claiming tvScientific’s gross revenue is approximately $100 million. Both independents made executive moves to harness a potential windfall of clients leaving the holding companies for better service and results.

Title: The robot revolution
URL: https://theweek.com/tech/robot-revolution-ai
Time Published: 2025-12-15T22:52:01Z
Full Content:
SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Advances in tech and AI are producing android machine workers. What will that mean for humans? Humanoid robots that can obey commands, make decisions, and deftly perform manual tasks have long been a sci-fi fantasy. Now they are becoming reality. Artificial intelligence, coupled with advances in robotics, has the potential to give humanoid robots unprecedented power to analyze, “think,” and learn. Tech evangelists say these robots will have a transformative impact on workplaces and even in our homes, and not in distant decades but in the next few years. Elon Musk believes robots will be “the biggest product ever in history.” His Tesla robot Optimus can already climb stairs and carry 45-pound objects, and he says Tesla will deliver a million units a year by 2030. By 2035, Citigroup predicts, some 1.3 billion robots will be in operation, both in industrial settings and in households, nursing homes, and construction sites. “By the 2040s,” said Adam Dorr, research director at the analytics firm RethinkX, “there will be almost nothing a robot can’t do better and cheaper than a human.” China already has more than 2 million of them working in factories, and the U.S. is rushing to catch up. In workplaces across America, robots are lifting boxes, transporting goods, even flipping burgers. At a Spanx warehouse outside Atlanta, humanoid bots pluck baskets of clothes from wheeled bots and set them on conveyor belts. To unpack trucks in several facilities, the shipping company DHL uses wheeled Stretch robots from Boston Dynamics, which can lift 50-pound boxes using flexible arms covered in vacuum suction cups. Just one can unload nearly 600 cases per hour, nearly double what humans can do. BMW just finished a pilot program in Spartanburg, S.C., where robot tasks included loading sheet metal parts into a welder. Even small firms are getting in on the action. Greg LeFevre is CEO of Raymath, a metal-fabrication company in Troy, Ohio. His factory is using 13 robot arms, supervised by his human employees, and he says the machines can work around the clock and can execute tricky aluminum welds “anywhere from two to six times faster” than a person. But it’s the nation’s second-largest private employer, Amazon, that is taking the biggest leap. It has a million robots working in various capacities and says some 75% of its global deliveries are assisted by robotics. At its 3-million-square-foot “next generation” facility in Shreveport, La., some 1,000 robots of various shapes and sizes shuttle pallets across floors, pluck items from storage bins, and load packages onto carts. Citing internal documents, The New York Times reported last month that Amazon is on track to replace some 600,000 jobs with robots in the coming years, even with sales projected to double by 2033. Its transformation will be closely watched, said Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor who studies automation. “Once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others too.” Escape your echo chamber.

Robot enthusiasts say the next frontier after warehouses and factories will be homes. The California robotics firm 1X Technologies is taking $20,000 preorders for its Neo robots, with expected delivery next year. The 5-foot, 6-inch humanoids—which currently require remote human operators to joystick them around but will eventually be autonomous—will not just clean toilets and load dishwashers. They’ll also be able to share jokes and engage in “lively, natural conversations,” says the firm. CEO Bernt Bornich believes users will rely on them for both cleaning and companionship. “I don’t think it’s another person, and it’s not a pet,” he said. “It’s something else.” There’s no question robots will take away some jobs, but the net effect is a matter of debate. Tech CEOs are quick to say that in fact new higher-skilled jobs will be created—like the position of robot wrangler—and that robots will largely fill dull jobs that most people don’t want. The bots unloading DHS trucks, for example, do “the most hated job in a warehouse,” said Marc Theermann of Boston Dynamics. But some scientists say the robot revolution is still far off, because the machines still have significant physical limitations. Those who think android plumbers and cooks will soon proliferate should “reset expectations,” said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at University of California, Berkeley. For one thing, it’s proved very hard to endow them with the dexterity to manipulate objects, such as “pick up a wine glass or change a light bulb,” he said. “No robot can do that.” Robot evangelists say yes. They say robots are learning so quickly that their advent will inevitably lead to labor-market upheaval. Kavin, a 27-year-old who helps train AI robots to fold clothes in India, says the humanoids aren’t perfect. “Sometimes the robot’s arms throw the clothes,” he says. “Sometimes it scatters the stack.” But he says they’re improving to the point where soon, “they’ll be able to do all the jobs, and there will be none left for us.” Anticipating pushback over mass layoffs, Amazon is reportedly developing plans to mitigate the fallout through community outreach, and other companies are commissioning studies on possible impacts. “We’re basically going to live in a world,” says Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure AI, “where any physical labor is a choice.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Feature ‘America’s vaccine playbook is being rewritten by people who don’t believe in them’ the explainer Despite the rising expense of auto insurance premiums and repairs, there are ways to save IN THE SPOTLIGHT By focusing solely on ‘intentional discrimination,’ the Justice Department risks allowing more subtle forms of bias to proliferate Speed Read Kids under age 16 are now barred from platforms including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit Feature If you get a puzzling text message from a stranger, you may be the target of ‘pig butchering.’ The Week Recommends Advanced AI may have made slop videos harder to spot, but experts say it’s still possible to detect them Under the radar Pollution from Colossal looms over a small Southern town, potentially exacerbating health concerns feature Cloudflare was the latest in a string of outages Under The Radar ‘Adversarial poems’ are convincing AI models to go beyond safety limits Under the radar Technology is taking a turn feature Letting robots do the shopping The Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Ticker: New York City is getting its first 3 Las Vegas-style casinos; Roomba maker iRobot files for bankruptcy

The New York Mets’ ballpark in Queens. A Bronx golf course once operated by President Donald Trump ’s company. A slot parlor on a horse racing track near John F. Kennedy International Airport. The three disparate sites, located far from the tourist hub of Manhattan, will become the future homes of New York City’s first Las Vegas-style resort casinos. The state Gaming Commission on Monday awarded the three projects licenses to operate in the lucrative metropolitan-area market during a meeting at a riverside park in upper Manhattan. The panel approved the licenses with the condition that the companies each appoint an outside monitor that would report regularly to the commission to ensure they meet their financial and legal obligations, as well as the promised investments they made to local communities. Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction.

Title: Amazon sells a free-to-play MOBA it had in development, and the studio making it, to Ubisoft

The sale of March of Giants comes less than two months after Amazon said it had decided to "halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon's slow, shambolic withdrawal from mainstream videogame development continued apace with today's announcement that it has offloaded the free-to-play MOBA March of Giants, which is still in development, onto Ubisoft. The deal will also see Amazon Games Montreal, headed up by former Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis and Ubisoft Toronto managing director Alexandre Parizeau, join Ubisoft as part of its Montreal studio. "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle," said Marquis, the creative director on March of Giants. "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we're excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level." Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot shared similar sentiments, saying that March of Giants "has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas." "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players," Guillemot said. "We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Thrilled to have the March of Giants team join Ubisoft Montréal! These seasoned developers—many who built their careers here—are pushing boundaries with their competitive MOBA experience. Welcome! Full details here: https://t.co/XHree0iuqD pic.twitter.com/qN8HXWsEwnDecember 15, 2025 The MOBA genre can indeed be lucrative, if you happen to be the company that made League of Legends or Dota 2. For everyone else, it's more of a fistfight over the crumbs. Gigantic: Rampage Edition and Seekers of Skyveil both crashed out quickly after launch, and while Smite 2 continues to trundle along, Hi-Rez Studios has struggled badly with layoffs and game shutdowns over the past couple years. The only game with the potential to shake things up in the genre is Deadlock, almost entirely due to the fact it's being developed by Valve. The response to the March of Giants closed alpha in September might suggest that it's in for a similarly rough ride. Not that the reaction is overly negative, there just doesn't seem to be much of it at all: The "closed alpha recap" post, the most recent update, has drawn a total of six comments, and the game's Steam forum in general is largely devoid of activity; the March of Giants Discord seems similarly moribund. How likely it is that Ubisoft will be able to turn that around is anyone's guess, although the odds don't strike me as particularly great. But assuming it follows the LoL/Dota 2 pricing scheme, March of Giants does seem like it could be a good fit for Ubisoft's focus on live service games in the future. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amazon, meanwhile, hasn't completely stepped back from the videogame business. It remains committed to publishing the two new Tomb Raider games announced at The Game Awards 2025, and it also seemingly sees big things in AI-fuelled garbage like Courtroom Chaos Featuring Snoop Dog. This may not be a great time for Ubisoft to try busting into the MOBA biz, but at least it's better than that. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

SBS Audio If it wasn’t for the fact that an innocent man, Fernando Pereira, died when a Greenpeace protest ship was blown up in Auckland Harbour in 1985, this podcast could be called an entertaining romp. We move from semi-amateur police on tiny Norfolk Island to the sinister efficiency of the French agents who mounted the attack as a riposte to New Zealand’s rejection of nuclear weapons.

The conviction was quashed last week due to procedural issues and a retrial ordered, but the ABC has decided to keep the podcast available to listeners. 21 years before Clay’s death, Lynn’s separated wife, Lisa, was found dead in strange circumstances. Her body was found on the lawn. A Nick Cave song, Nobody’s Baby Now, was playing on repeat – Cave was a favourite of Lynn. An inquest found Lisa died from a mix of alcohol and medication, yet friends insist she would never have over-indulged with her toddler sons inside. With a measured tone, Brown builds a disturbing picture of a woman trapped in what we now recognise as coercive control. It should be mandatory listening for domestic violence responders.

March of Giants rights also acquired. Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants. As per Ubisoft's announcement, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis, who joined Amazon in 2021 after leaving Ubisoft two years prior. As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game." "March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on Twitch. Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team." In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease, and word emerged suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned.

By MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot’s primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,” iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn’t expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31.

Tomb Raider CatalystTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis At last weekâs Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics announced not one, but two Tomb Raider games. One is the next chapter in Lara Croftâs adventures, called Tomb Raider Catalyst; the other is a remake of the original game titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, the same company working on the Sophie Turner-led live-action series. All of this is in an effort to turn Lara into a multimedia superstar with multiple projects running under one roof. With Amazonâs known history of being terrible, fans are probably wondering how deeply its claws are stuck into the Tomb Raider series, and Crystal Dynamics has spoken a little bit about the partnership. In a group Q&A session that Kotaku was present for, Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos and game director Will Kerslake spoke about Amazonâs role in both the upcoming Tomb Raider games and the show. Tomb Raider has been a cross-media franchise for decades, with the Angelina Jolie films being some of the earliest examples of a video game adaptation doing well at the box office, but now Amazon and Crystal Dynamics are trying to make something interconnected, though Crystal Dynamics wouldnât confirm if Catalyst would be tied to the upcoming series when it launches in 2027. âOur Amazon partners have been tremendous,â Amos said. âFrom the beginning, they’ve gotten the idea of this vision we have for this cross-media franchise that crossed both the live-action things during the series and the two games that we’re making right now, but we’re not here to talk about any details and anything else in the future about the TV series until later on.â As far as how deep this partnership goes, Amos said collaborating with Amazonâs own set of creative directors, narrative writers, and producers has been like speaking into a âmirrorâ as the two groups have worked together to pave the way for the future of the series as this multimedia franchise, and that the team is meeting with Amazon folks âdaily,â including on-site visits from Amazon to run through the latest development milestones. âOn the development side, we have partners across all the different disciplines that we work with directly,â Kerslake said. âSo as a member of the dev team, it’s been great to have collaborative partners focused on the quality of the game that trust the team to find the answers to those problems.â By the time Tomb Raider Catalyst launches in 2027, it will have been nine years since the last mainline Tomb Raider game. Shadow of the Tomb Raider launched in 2018 to good but not great reviews, though it did eventually go on to sell over 8.9 million copies. Since then, Tomb Raider has had a lot of re-releases of old games. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is coming out before Catalyst, and this isnât even the first time the original game has been remade, as Tomb Raider: Anniversary also brought that first adventure to modern audiences back in 2007. When asked if Catalyst might be taking longer to come out because Crystal Dynamics is putting more resources into the remake, Amos said “absolutely not,â that the remake had been planned for the franchiseâs 30th anniversary next year and is being handled by a different team than Catalyst. Shadow Warrior developer Flying Wild Hog is working on Legacy of Atlantis, but Amos says the team is still âconnectedâ to Crystal Dynamics and the broader Tomb Raider development team. âWe actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets, but we have one leadership team, a visionary team over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling,â Amos said. Amos said the partnership was made possible by the Fellowship Entertainment subsidiary of the Embracer Group, which is one of the many arms of the company that houses its too-goddamn-many IP like Tomb Raider and Lord of the Rings. Consolidation of media aside, Amos says this partnership has allowed both teams to fully dedicate their time to their respective games in parallel development without siphoning resources from one another. After years of Tomb Raider games looking back at Laraâs survivalist origins, Catalyst is finally moving the timeline forward, though the studio says it has designed Catalyst so players can jump in with “no homework required.” Dragon Age and Assassinâs Creed actor Alix Wilton Regan is voicing the treasure hunter now, and the way Crystal Dynamics describes the game makes it sound like itâs a new era for her and the series, so perhaps a new voice is another sign of that. However, Crystal Dynamics has also made clear that this isnât another reboot or a different timeline. This is the same Lara Croft fans have known and loved for decades, just in a âdifferent timeâ in her life. So perhaps itâs not a bad time to revisit the original game and its more traditional action-adventure roots before finally nudging Lara forward after a decade of survivalist prequels.Â Crystal Dynamics has been put through the wringer over the past few years ever since Square Enix sold it off to Embracer Group, with layoffs happening as recently as last month. Itâs a damn shame those affected workers wonât be around to bring Catalyst past the finish line, but hopefully the end result is able to shine through all that inner turmoil when it launches in 2027.

Title: Reviewing My Wishes for 2026
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/12/15/reviewing-my-wishes-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T16:15:36Z
Full Content:
Here we are at the far end of 2025 and everything is both better and worse than I expected. The Year was 2025… and I was not prepared On the bad side of the ledger… I cannot even start to sum up what a disaster 2025 has been for the US. This is some real “end of the Roman republic” shit and everybody in power is just grabbing stuff for themselves, with naked corruption on display and nobody cares. Absolutely unprecedented criminal activity in plain sight by Republicans, who have decided the law doesn’t apply to them. This stuff only ends in dictatorship and we’re not even going to get an Augustus at this point, having gone straight to Nero with dementia and everybody has to donate to his causes and give him fake awards to in order to conduct business in the US. And it is all going to get worse as he ages and the corruption becomes a huge drag on the economy. Then the AI bubble is going to collapse, and then the real problems will start when CEOs don’t get their bonuses and start laying off even more people. So there is all that. On the bright side, personally, I still have a job, healthcare, and a home. We’re not struggling. Day to day things are still “normal.” Granted, we’re not buying anything either as the price of everything, from beef to blueberries, is going up and dinner for two at even a modest restaurant goes past $100 if we order a cocktail. But that Costco whole roasted chicken is still a deal. Anyway, I knew it was going to be bad so rather than doing predictions at the start of the year, I altered my annual tradition, wherein I feel obligated to foresee how things might go bad, and chose to go with a hopeful set of wishes. For those interested in the history of this routine, I have links! Of course I do! Now here we are in the back half of the last month of the year and it is time to do the accounting, to credit the universe for the wishes it granted and grumble about those it denied. For purposes of measurement, wishes have the usual 10 point value, with partial credit available for partial fulfillment, unless otherwise indicated in the wish. Are we ready? Let’s do this. 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Hah hah hah… no. Phil Spencer won’t be sufficiently motivated unless he gets an obscene bonus, which meant laying people off at XBox and elsewhere. I don’t know what he’ll do when he runs out of staff to lay off, but we’re getting closer to finding out. Zero points. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. Hah hah hah… no. In fact, things seems to be going in the opposite direction for Daybreak and EG7. Capital management firms want more stock buybacks and more dividend payments. There will be no investment in the future. Zero points. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. Okay, this was a gimme for 2025. I am not so sure it will be for 2026 though. 10 points. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. I didn’t even believe this back in January, so no surprises here with zero points. It is only disappointing because ArenaNet managed to do something for original Guild Wars. Hell, they added controller support. 5 – Commit To or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Again, wish denied. EG7 keeps hyping H1Z1 as an important first party title in its financials, but has done nothing with it. Zero points. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. I mean, we are technically getting housing in 2025. It showed up last week. But I couldn’t tell you if they messed it up. The previews got some shade from people with no investment in the game while the current fan boys have declared it to be everything anybody could ever want plus a bag of chips. Still, if the fans aren’t revolting, Works for the true believers even if the non-invested seem less than impressed, so I guess they didn’t mess up completely. Give me… erm, the universe… 6 points on this one while the jury is still out in the long term. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace Hah hah hah… no. Blizz seems to be actively sabotaging WoW Classic at this point. Expansions running way too long, modern features being shoehorned into old content, and the heavy hands of monetization are all weighing on the experience. I am expecting somebody in Blizz leadership to revive the J. Allen Brack quote about thinking you want classic and declare that he was right all along… or announce a new version of vanilla with Dungeon Finder, achievements, WoW Tokens, and a cash shop. Anyway, zero points here. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new Fuck no. That might impact Phil Spencer’s bonus. And I thought Bobby Kotick was bad, but he at least found space in the budget for some new titles. Zero points. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access Nope. Still three devs in a yurt grinding out code on stone tablets. Zero points. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access Now I am just going start getting angry. This isn’t even a real project. Zero points, though I feel like it should get negative points for being such a psych. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on Sure, at least Sean Murray and crew are still working on that. Corvettes were awesome. 10 points. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles Not really. It will be a few years before it is playable and they figure out people don’t like to be ganked by ornothoptors or whatever all day long. Still, it runs. Maybe 4 points. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving It seemed to do well for most of the year. Then Amazon decided to stop supporting third party platforms to favor their own Luna AI offerings. Still, for most of the year GoG.com was doing well. Call it 8 points. 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy No. They either don’t know or cannot admit as much. Things are “better” but how much was them just cranking the dials at random until some metric went up? The price of PLEX is down 25% since its 2025 peak. Good for buyers, but bad for sellers. I’ll give the universe 4 points for at least the Mineral Price Index going down finally, though does that mean they fixed something or that there is some other problem? 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Nope. Zero points. Next. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title Hah hah hah… no. They either want a late 90s FPS or a blockchain scam title. Nothing people will pay to play for fun. Zero points. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Wasted a wish on that as well. Zero points. 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done I should just lay off New Eden. Burnout and ill health has put a damper on progress. Zero points. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Mein Gott, enough already. I mean, we did get a few minutes of war. PanFam did occasionally fight back as we rolled east and up to their boarder… then the core of the coalition, Pandemic Horde, collapsed and ran away and eventually folded into The Initiative, so we spent a few weeks blowing up structures unopposed, random hero structure gunners not forgotten. While that is an element of many wars in New Eden, that wasn’t the was we wanted. Call it 3 points, one for each Keepstar they at least tried to defend. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News Yeah no… the money was on the original Guild Wars being remastered I guess. Who knew? Zero points. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll Yes, this seems to be going well. It is a little rough at every major update, but it gets worked out, and there is a 1.0 target for next spring. 10 points. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach I want to be charitable and say yes, it did expand. But it still feels years away from any vision Raph was spinning back when he was going on about design pillars. I am sure the underlying code has improved, but the actual play tests feel like they did a year back, just with more restrictions. My fault for having expectations and expecting more from the universe when it grants wishes. Call it 5 points. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 Do I get triple points because it went to level 80? I am going to dissect the essence of this wish, which was for a 10 level raise in the level cap. And, sure enough, everybody who was level 50 went straight to level 70, leaving them 10 more levels to work on. It kind of worked out if you squint at it real hard. I am claiming 10 points for the universe on this one. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake Nope. Zero points. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. The cut off date for wishes is December 15. Zero points. Hardly a surprise this failed to pan out given the Mark Jacobs track record for the last 20 years. 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck It became a live service, game pass, drip updates, buy the new shiny of the month style of game to rival even the most annoying Paradox title. It made a splash for a month or two then disappeared from sight. 2 points for the effort. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Hah, no! Zero points. See you next year! 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Nope, Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down revealed instead. Zero points. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominated and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real What was I even thinking? Gabe isn’t buying mega yachts off of developing games, just on taxing developers selling games on his platform. This guy might be the least worst rich gaming CEO or executive, and he is still fucking miserable. Half Life 3 will never happen. Zero points. But what if he is just holding it back as a launch title for the GabeCube? Better draft it in FCL again this year, just in case! Summing Up So, if all wishes had been granted, it would have been worth 300 points, there being 30 wishes and 10 points a piece. Unless my ability to count is seriously impaired, three passes down the list all came up with 82 points scored. That gives the universe about a 27% wish fulfillment rate, counting partials. The universe is about on par with my average year’s ability to guess. So it goes. This was my 18th round of guesses over the life of the blog. Time to get ready for the 19th. For 2026 it will be all predictions. Then maybe I for the 20th can sum up how well I have done over the years in total, maybe pulling out my most unlikely guesses that came true… though that sounds like work. We’ll see. Anyway, look for the next round showing up at a January 1st 2026 near you! Gaming (or maybe just my relationship with it) was weird this year. On the one hand, I played a ton of games I really enjoyed, so I can’t fairly say it was a ‘bad’ year. On the other hand, I played mostly the same games this year that I did last year (League of Legends, TableTopSim for 40k, Rimworld), with some ‘new’ games like FFT:remaster in the mix. The list of truly new games released that I thought were awesome? Pretty short. LikeLike For the record, I think a better bet next year would be that Microsoft would pawn XBox off to some Private Equity Firm ™, which means that all of those game studios will implode within 4-5 years. Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and WoW won’t save Bethesda and Blizzard from a potential bad end, since the PE Firm will only want Call of Duty and mobile games. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. Would Clair Obscure count as well? LikeLike Oh, but why sell it off when you could force AI into everything to help justify setting billions of dollars on fire on that front? Plenty of options on the table. And yes, I CO33 would count as well. I wrote most of this before the game awards so that wasn’t front and center in my mind having won all the awards. LikeLike I know it’s after the cut-off, but apparently LOTRO just announced that UI scaling is coming with its next patch. (Saw someone posting about it on Bluesky.) LikeLike I’ll be interested to see what they have. They have acknowledged scaling as an issue back in 2016 and have talked about it off and on, but they have not delivered much on that front. LikeLike Regarding #12 – I can‘t comment on anything Conan Exiles related as I haven‘t played that, but Dune is very much „playable“ right now. Even if you‘re a lot quicker than I was to reach the deep desert you‘ll still have at least 50 hours of well designed, awesome (in my opinion, obviously) content ahead of you until there‘s even a chance of running into any griefing-related problems. Personally, I got over 200 very enjoyable hours out of the game. No sign of griefing during any of them, btw. LikeLike Whatever LoTRO has coming it’s already on the test server. According to Reddit, it works pretty well. That will teach you to give up on your wishes too soon! Maybe the game industry will correct itself and start treating their employees well in the next two weeks ;-) LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn't expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot's primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners," iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn't expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Fremantle Closes ‘Don’t Pick Up The Phone’ Maker Wag Entertainment’s Production Arm

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Fremantle is closing Don’t Pick up the Phone maker Wag Entertainment’s production arm, with MD Steven Green exiting after 26 years. Fremantle acquired Wag last year when it bought owner Asacha Media Group and we understand the move comes as part of ongoing strategic planning related to Asacha. Wag Entertainment’s distribution arm, which is run by Janice Strangward, is staying put, and Wag’s IP remains with Fremantle. Green is leaving along with co-founder Eliya Arman, creative director Bridget Boseley, production boss Kate Gibbard and production manager Kelly Hood. Layoffs are in the single figures, we are told. Related Stories News Fremantle Bosses To Keynote Series Mania As 'Got Talent' Producer Turns 25 Cancellations and Renewals 'Hotel Costiera' Not Returning For Season 2 On Prime Video; Jesse Williams Series Shopped By Fremantle - The Dish Across nearly 30 years, Wag has been a prolific British documentary producer. Credits include Science Channel’s What On Earth?, Paramount+’s Don’t Date Brandon, Prime Video’s Murderer Behind the Mask and Netflix-Paramount+’s Don’t Pick up the Phone. The latter came via an innovative streaming model that saw Paramount+ take UK rights and Netflix rest of world. Upcoming, Wag’s Secrets of the Conclave airs on the BBC in a week’s time. Watch on Deadline Wag was acquired by Asacha in 2021, at which point founder Martin Durkin left and was replaced by Green. Fremantle has been strategizing over the future of Asacha since it bought the firm in 2024 and both Asacha founders have since exited. Green said the Wag team “leaves on a high” after making projects during the past year for Amazon, Paramount+ and a trio of British broadcasters. “Everyone at Wag is proud of what we’ve achieved, and this year’s success, as well as the success of the past two and half decades, is all down to the many talented people we’ve worked with,” he added. “So on behalf of Eliya, Bridget, Kate and Kelly, a heartfelt thank you to all the freelancers and staffers, past and present, for 26 brilliant years.” Fremantle UK CEO Amelia Brown said: “We would like to say a huge thank you to Steven and the team for their incredible work and achievements. Wag has made great contributions to Fremantle since its successful integration under Asacha Media Group last year. We wish all the team at WAG the very best in their future endeavours.” Asacha, and now Fremantle, owns the likes of Death in Paradise producer Red Planet Pictures, Magic of Disney’s Animal Kingdom maker Arrow and Oscar-nominated Les Misérables producer SRAB. Fremantle owner RTL previously said the super-indie spent more than €200M ($234M) on Asacha and 80% of Singapore’s Beach House Pictures in 2024.

Title: Gaskin: End of DOGE marks missed AI opportunity
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/14/gaskin-end-of-doge-marks-missed-ai-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T08:02:31Z
Full Content:
In late November, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quietly disbanded months ahead of schedule, with senior officials confirming that the agency “no longer exists” in any centralized form. Its end marks not only the collapse of a widely publicized initiative but one of the greatest missed opportunities of the Trump administration. At a moment when artificial intelligence was transforming nearly every major industry, the federal government had a rare chance to reinvent itself. Instead, it stepped backward. When DOGE launched in January 2025, President Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk — a global technology figure — as the program’s celebrity face. With its rhetoric of trillion-dollar savings and sweeping modernization, DOGE could have become the most ambitious public-sector innovation project in American history. Yet instead of using Musk’s technological expertise — and especially artificial intelligence — to modernize federal operations, streamline public services, and build a new digital foundation for government, DOGE quickly devolved into old-school mass layoffs and headline-friendly cuts. Estimates from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, and the OECD suggest that 40% to 60% of all jobs could be reshaped by AI, but the administration traded a once-in-a-generation modernization opportunity for a chainsaw. DOGE’s most dramatic action was the firing of an estimated 280,000 federal employees in a matter of months. This created the impression of sudden efficiency, but it reflected a deeper strategic failure: DOGE chose subtraction over transformation. Programs that were ripe for AI augmentation — veterans’ claims processing, Social Security workflows, IRS casework, public-health analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory review — were not redesigned or modernized. They were simply downsized, often in ways that made the remaining work slower, more expensive, and less secure. Agencies were forced to rehire many of the same workers as contractors. Anti-fraud programs that recovered more money than they cost were shut down entirely. And when DOGE abruptly ended FDA and EPA user-fee programs, Congress had to pass emergency appropriations to keep essential operations running. The most significant loss, however, was not financial — it was the opportunity to use AI to rebuild government for the next generation. Rather than accelerating federal performance, DOGE slowed it down as agencies confronted aging systems, soaring service demands, and rapidly escalating cybersecurity threats. Entire cybersecurity teams were dismantled just as AI-powered attacks were multiplying worldwide. Public disputes between Musk and senior officials — often amplified across social media — further undermined morale and trust. The disruption was damaging, but the deeper tragedy was the transformation that never even began. This failure is especially stark when contrasted with an earlier and far more successful modernization effort. From 1993 to 2000, Vice President Al Gore led the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), the largest and most effective government reform initiative of the modern era. NPR delivered verified, inflation-adjusted savings of roughly $300 billion, but its true success lay in how those savings were achieved. Gore’s approach was methodical rather than theatrical. NPR modernized processes, digitized operations, reduced administrative layers, strengthened customer service, and embedded reforms through bipartisan legislation such as the Government Performance and Results Act. Workforce changes were handled through attrition, early retirements, and voluntary buyouts — not mass firings — allowing reforms to be stable, sustainable, and non-polarizing. NPR built capacity. DOGE dismantled it. DOGE could have used its mandate to invite the world’s leading AI organizations — OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI, Google Research, Microsoft AI, Amazon AWS AI, Apple AI, xAI, Mistral, Nvidia, and Cohere — to compete to solve the government’s hardest operational challenges. Such a competition could have produced multilingual digital assistants for the American public, AI copilots for federal workers, advanced fraud-detection engines capable of saving billions, AI-accelerated code modernization tools, stronger cybersecurity, and dramatically reduced backlogs across veterans’ services, Social Security, and tax processing. These tools could have been interoperable, reusable, and transferable across both the public and private sectors. DOGE could have launched the first AI-powered reinvention of the federal government — and instead, it chose elimination over innovation. By the time DOGE dissolved, the opportunity was gone. The United States was left with a federal workforce that was not more modern, not more efficient, and in critical areas, significantly weaker. The death of DOGE is not fundamentally about missed cost savings. It is the story of a historic opportunity squandered. Modernizing government does not require chainsaws, celebrity feuds, or ideological crusades. It requires vision, collaboration, technological expertise, and respect for the institutional knowledge necessary to implement change responsibly. Above all, it requires a commitment to building. Had DOGE embraced an AI-first strategy, the United States might today be leading the world in digital governance, offering faster services, safer systems, and more transparent operations. Instead, DOGE stands as a cautionary tale — a reminder that spectacular claims are no substitute for serious reform. As policymakers consider the next chapter of government modernization, they would do well to study Al Gore’s quiet, durable NPR — and imagine what might be possible if today’s most advanced AI labs were finally invited to help build the future of American government.

Short-form video is taking over everything (including reading). Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel turns the camera on himself to ask a simple question: Why are you seeing his face? Using YouTube’s takeover of podcasts as a starting point, he explores how video has devoured audio and turned podcasts into something closer to daytime TV and late-night talk shows. NPR’s Rachel Martin, host of the celebrity-interview show Wild Card, joins to talk about her own shift from intimate, audio-only conversations to highly visible video chats with mega-celebrities. She explains how the visual layer changes everything—from building trust with guests and audiences to deepening parasocial relationships, and why showing your face is necessary in a low-trust media world. To trace the business and cultural arc of this pivot, Bloomberg reporter Ashley Carman explains the rise and fall of the podcast “gold rush”—from the Serial era to Spotify’s billion-dollar bet, to the collapse of expensive narrative audio and YouTube’s emergence as a true power player. Then, writer and Plain English host Derek Thompson joins to explain his theory that “everything is television now.” Warzel and Thompson explore how short-form video, autoplay feeds, and video podcasts are reshaping our attention, our politics, and even our sense of self—turning podcasts into background “wallpaper” while nudging more of us into broadcasting our lives. Together, the conversations sketch a weird, slightly berserk future where video podcasts aren’t just a format—they’re a window into a lonelier, more fragmented, video-first culture. The following is a transcript of the episode: Derek Thompson: Do you actually need to sit still by yourself and listen to your thoughts, ever? Like, is that good for you at all? Should you just always choose to, like, download other people’s thoughts inside of your brain so you’re never stuck with the sort of, you know, subvocal questions of your own consciousness? I feel honest about this, because I’m not sure that these are, like, familiar feelings. I feel like we’re sort of being thrust into, again, a kind of really unnatural experiment based on these technologies. And, you know, given the changes in mental health over the last few decades, it’s not entirely clear to me that surrounding ourselves with the constant … bombarding ourselves with the constant thoughts for the people is particularly good for our sanity. [Music] Charlie Warzel: Hello, and welcome to Galaxy Brain. I’m Charlie Warzel. And if you’re watching this on YouTube, welcome to my face—and apologies for my face, which is actually the subject of today’s show. Why are you seeing my face, or, perhaps more appropriately, why did YouTube devour podcasting? So as a technology reporter, one thing that I absolutely love is just being an internet crash-test dummy, right there. I think that there’s no better way to understand a platform than to try to make things and share things on them. So part of my reporting has always been to try to lean into riding the algorithmic waves myself and just watching what happens, right? That’s a big reason why we launched Galaxy Brain as a video podcast. There’s all these questions that I have. Like, you know, how do YouTube thumbnails and titles change the way that a video performs? What happens when you make something evergreen versus something newsy? How valuable is a celebrity to having your video go viral? Ultimately, who’s watching these things, right? I feel like there’s just no better way to really understand what is happening online than to do things online. And so that’s just one very small reason why you’re seeing my face, right? But it’s not just me. There’s just a lot of people in media and journalism who were previously scribes or just audio podcasters, right, who’ve become YouTubers or TikTokers. And so you could say that this is just like pivoting to video, right? Back in the 2010s, there was this sort of infamous “pivot to video,” mostly caused by people responding to incentives on Facebook. And it was mostly disastrous for people. As a digital-media survivor of the 2010s, I had to endure that. And I think that what’s happening now, though, is different. I think it’s much less responsive to the whims of these platforms, and I think it’s a lot more driven by audiences. It’s also a lot more popular. In late 2024, this research firm, Edison Research, said that “YouTube has risen to the top as the most popular service used for podcast listening in the United States. Thirty-one percent of weekly podcast listeners 13 and up choose YouTube as the service that they use to listen to it.” That’s well surpassed Spotify, which is at 27 percent, and Apple Podcasts, which is at 15 percent. They also said that “84 percent of Gen Z monthly podcast listeners listen or watch podcasts with a video component.” And so it’s very popular to be a YouTuber with a podcast. This trend has been moving pretty steadily since about 2019, and that’s when some popular podcasts started posting to YouTube and seeing some success with these short clippings. They were called YouTube Shorts. And this was getting a lot of traction in YouTube’s algorithm, but it’s booming now. This past October, Spotify announced that a bunch of their popular podcasts from The Ringer, like the Bill Simmons show—they’re all going to be streaming on Netflix. And so, essentially, what you have is podcasts that are behaving like normal television. There’s been a whole bunch of weird sort of externalities that have come out of this. Recently, Bloomberg reported on this outgrowth of this video-podcasting boom, and one thing that’s happened is the rise of clippers. So these are people that capture the best moments from various videos online, and they seed them across social media. Really big YouTubers like Mr. Beast have hired them to do work for them, and they pay about $50 for every hundred thousand views. You’ve also got record labels that are employing clippers to take miscellaneous video footage and pair it with artists’ songs on places like TikTok. In this weird way, this is this convergence of all media into one big blob of short-form video content, right? I think that all of this is just changing consumption behaviors. I hear this from a bunch of people in my life, who—they come home, and they turn on YouTube, and they stream podcasts while they do other things. They do it from their TV. And so it seems like podcasts have moved from, like, not even a second-screen experience, right? It’s like a one-and-a-half-screen experience. And so I think that there’s something here. I think that the shift tells us quite a bit about the way that people are moving away from the medium of text and toward basically anything that’s similar to short-form video content. Anything that can be clipped, edited, picked apart, put on social media to go viral. And I think that all this has a lot to do with our attention spans, but also the parasocial relationships that people are developing with people who used to be in their ears a whole bunch of hours a week. Right? People are interested in seeing these creators inside and out, including their workspaces. And, apologies again. I think that this change has something to tell us about our culture and our technology, and I think it can maybe even help explain other anecdotal trends—like these concerns that people aren’t reading as much as they used to. This is a big, sprawling, really interesting topic. And to tackle it, I’ve assembled what I think is a murderer’s row of guests: people who work as video podcasters, analysts in the podcast space, and media thinkers that I’ve admired for quite a while. So today, we’re going to figure out why you’re seeing my face. My first guest is NPR’s Rachel Martin: the host of the popular celebrity-interview show called Wild Card. And by now, a video-podcast pro. Rachel, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thank you for being a guinea pig in this experiment of ours. Rachel Martin: Thank you for having me. I’m so happy to be here. Warzel: So I wanted to do this thing like an episode, and the title is kind of like, “Why Are You Seeing My Face?” Because the question I don’t understand, as, like, a face for blogging, you know, throughout my career. It seems like journalists are just increasingly becoming YouTubers, and YouTubers are increasingly trying to become podcasters, and there’s this sort of like—everyone’s meeting in the middle, right? But you are somebody who has been working in the audio space for a really long time. Has, you know, worked at that craft, and had this really close long-term relationship with an audience through a specific medium. Martin: Right. Warzel: You are also—you’ve moved into, you know, the video space, the YouTube space. You are interacting with, like, mega-celebrities all the time on video. You’re hosting a talk show. Martin: Yeah. Warzel: I guess, what has that experience been like for you? Going from this, you know, very sort of intimate “ear medium” to this visual one? Martin: I have so much to say on this topic, Charlie. Warzel: Good, good, good, good. Martin: And so you can direct me in any, in any particular path, conversationally. But I mean, I love audio. I should just say I still am completely in love with the intimacy of audio. That’s why I went into it. I worked in television news for a couple of years and intentionally left that job to go back to radio. Because I think it’s such a special medium. There’s just nothing like it. And to not have any distractions from anything else; it’s just you and that person and the sound of their voice. And anybody can insert themselves into that conversation, like, you know, a little fly on the wall. And it’s such a beautiful, beautiful experience. And I spent decades doing this work. So now, I do this thing as, as you said—now I have a podcast. But podcasts now are not just audio experiences; they’re video experiences. And I didn’t do this reluctantly. When we came up with this idea, my team and I wanted it to have a visual component, because the conceit that we had for the show, it’s with cards, these conversation cards. And it’s more fun. It’s interactive in a way that really lends itself to the medium of video. But it does—it changes the experience, you know? It is no longer just me and the sound of that person’s voice as the only input. There’s lots of inputs now. But I have come, Charlie, to love the inputs. There’s so many more things to play with in the sandbox of conversation, you know? Warzel: So like, what is one of those things that you have found that is kind of delightful in it? Because there is the part of it that’s like, Okay, I have to look a certain way, be worried about how I’m addressing whatever, the lights— Martin: Yeah that part’s annoying Warzel: It’s backlit, like all that. Put makeup— Martin: Now, I don’t wear my pajamas, and I have to like, you know, try. I have to try, but maybe I should do that anyway. But, I mean, now I get to see you smile. Right now I get to see you be amused. I get to watch someone’s body language as they think through something. And especially for our show, there’s these big, deep questions. And they demand a lot of thoughtfulness. And I love watching someone absorb the question that I’ve asked. And so there’s just so—there are so many more ingredients to the conversation, and I find it to be really exciting. It’s just different for me, and I have more to play with. It can feel chaotic sometimes. I’m like—oh, if I were just listening to the sound of someone’s voice, you know, I wouldn’t be paying attention to their body language. Or I wouldn’t be paying attention to like, some kind of tick that they had that they kept doing. Or the way they were tapping their foot during an answer because the question made them nervous. But now all those inputs shape how I respond as a listener. When you’re working in audio, you’re just listening so intently, right? But now my aperture is just so much wider. I can see how someone is responding to a question or thinking through it in such a richer way. And I honestly do feel like it leads to better conversations. I did not use to think this. You know, Terry Gross, Fresh Air: She had this rule; I think she still has it. She just does all her interviews remotely, because she doesn’t want the distraction, and she believes it’s far more intimate to just have a voice with a voice. But I’m also trying to get people to trust me. And I think that being able to see another person’s face—you become more human to them, and then maybe you will trust me a little more with your stories. And I think that comes more readily when you see someone, the person interviewing you. I think it helps to see them, instead of just having this like authoritative “voice of God” kind of thing in your head. Warzel: I think that’s so important too. Because it’s funny—we’ve done probably, like, four different interviews for this show so far. And almost every one of them has gotten back to this idea somehow of trust, right? Like, I’m very interested in mediums and the attention economy. And the way that, you know, the medium changes, and it changes us too. And this idea of, we’re all, I think in the media grappling with this notion that that trust in these institutions is lower now. And this idea of finding ways to build it—but also finding ways to build it that aren’t shallow or that aren’t pandering. Or that aren’t, you know, having to capitulate on your own values in some kind of way. And I think you’re totally right that there is—not only in an interview, you know, between you and the interviewee, but also in terms of an audience. Like, have you noticed that the relationship to the audience, the feedback you’ve gotten, has that relationship changed? Do you feel like there’s a, a different valence to it, a different kind of trust there? Martin: The trust is so broken that the further we can pull back the veil—and the more people can trust the curators of their news and information, and their podcasts, even though mine is not a news podcast anymore—I think it’s necessary. I think that’s the way forward. And so, it feels uncomfortable for a lot of people, especially in news spaces, and journalists in general. Like, I’m not the story. I don’t wanna put myself in it. I think that ship has sailed. I think that people need to understand and trust the storyteller in a way that we never had to prove before. And I think putting yourself out there—literally, in your face—is one step toward that. Warzel: Yeah. I think sometimes there are times when I have done, in my career, like Q&As with people, right? And they’re always cleaned up—in the sense of, you know, just my rambling is a little less rambly. Their answers are maybe a little more succinct. We get to the meat and potatoes of it, and everyone looks like the most, you know, concise, professional version of themselves. Martin: Best version of themselves. Warzel: Phenomenal. Martin: And not real. Warzel: And not real. Right. And I think about, sometimes … you know, what I am excited about for a medium like this, what I think is exciting to watch, is watching us. As the people who are doing the newsgathering, or whatever you’re calling it—the interviewing, the presentation—struggling with these feelings, and struggling with our own things. Not in a way where we’re failing, but in trying to grasp it. And I think that it’s such a more human thing. One thing I’m absolutely curious about is: Have you noticed people forming more interesting parasocial relationships with you? Like, have you kind of gotten that sense of Wow, this person thinks they kind of know all of me, even though they know a side of me? Martin: Yeah. I mean, again, I end up revealing really personal things on my show. You know, my relationship with grief, and my parents died. And my relationship with my siblings and my insecurities. It’s ripe for that kind of parasocial relationship. So I sort of knew that that was going to be baked into the sauce here. But that’s what we want. I mean, I don’t want people showing up at my house and thinking, you know, that we’re best friends. But the whole point in growing audience—and really how you do it—is for your audience to feel like they do know you in a way that differentiates the relationship from other podcast hosts or curators of their news and information. So, I like it. I dig it. I’m into it. And I try to get into the comments and try to respond to people and reply to their emails. Because it’s a lonely world, and this is a way that people can feel connected to each other. And our show in particular was designed with that in mind. [Music] Warzel: Okay. So talking to Rachel, I kept thinking back to 2024. And the way that podcasts were playing this really important role in the media strategy around the presidential election. Recently in New York magazine, the reporter Nick Quah wrote that we are “still living in the long tail of last year’s podcast election, when audio and video shows became full-fledged political battlegrounds for messaging.” He makes a good argument, I think. Former podcasters are now running government agencies, and the biggest political and cultural fights are taking place in long, protracted discussions on niche podcasts held by influencers and former media personalities. Especially on the right, you’ve got Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly, who’ve taken their big platforms from cable news and moved them to podcast land. And Quah argues that—from the left’s growing power to the right’s fractures—podcasting is where arguments are shaped, tested, and turned into movements. Almost all of these are video podcasts. And so Rachel’s point, I think, is about the way that this format’s really ripe for these parasocial relationships. I think that that is absolutely key to all of this. Because in this moment of waning trust, podcasters are showing more of themselves to people, for longer. Sometimes hours a day, five days a week. And people are starting to feel like they know these hosts. And importantly, they trust them. But that doesn’t explain everything, right? Some of this is structural. Some of this is responding to business incentives. And that’s why I asked Ashley Carman, who covers the business of podcasting for Bloomberg, how we got here. [Music] Warzel: Ashley, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thank you for coming on. Ashley Carman: Yeah; thanks for having me. Warzel: So you cover the podcast space, the media space, for Bloomberg and have done so much great reporting. Kind of contextualizing the different shifts in the areas we’re in. Pivoting to video, not pivoting to video, you know. YouTubers starting podcasts, podcasters starting YouTube pages. Can you kind of describe to me a little bit the arc of how we got here? You know, I think we sort of have the kicking off with, like, the Serial age. But how do you see it in terms of the arc of where podcasts have gone in the last, like, seven to 10 years, in a speedrun kind of fashion? Carman: Yeah, we could definitely do this speedrun style. So yeah, starting with the Serial era, I think this was kind of the moment that people generally realized that podcasts could become a mainstream format. If you already were a public-radio fan, you’ve probably been listening to long-form audio at this point for some time. But Serial really captured the audiences in a podcast format, and so this was this moment where it became watercooler talk. Seemingly everyone you knew was obsessed with Serial. It was parodied on SNL. So it really became a cultural moment. And that’s when I think some agents started to pay attention to the space. That’s when other companies started to pay attention to the space. And Spotify, you know, soon thereafter started to dip a toe into their own kind of podcast experiments. In 2019, that’s really when we started to see major deals, and that’s when podcasting kind of popped from a like, Oh my God, there’s a business happening here, and the biggest tech platforms in the world care about this. So everyone got into the space, including Spotify, Amazon. SiriusXM, of course, was a satellite-radio company, but they started doing big podcast deals. Audible, you know, was already doing audiobooks, but they started to do their own podcast endeavors as well, also under the Amazon umbrella. And really, you just saw this focus from a probably audio-service focus that then started to care about on-demand podcasts. And then, you know—I think there’s that meme that’s like the trough of disillusionment. Warzel: Sure. Carman: And that kind of happens starting around 2022. You had all these tech platforms flood into the space, expecting to make significant returns on the investments they had in podcasting. And for context, Spotify spent over a billion dollars on podcasts. So they expected some seriously high returns. And it just didn’t pan out, really. I think there’s a few reasons for that we can dive into, but just podcasting as a whole, like the revenue side of it, didn’t pan out in the way they thought. And so there were a ton of layoffs. But then, where there started to be green shoots was YouTube. And it was kind of the sleeping giant—which I feel like has happened with YouTube, basically in every creative industry. Where all of a sudden YouTube itself also realized, during COVID, Hey, people are watching podcasts on our service, and maybe we should kind of focus on that. And they started to put money into it. They started to put product efforts into it. And really in the span of like three years, they became the top podcast platform in the U.S., according to Edison Research. So now podcasting is in this place where it’s really synonymous with the creator economy. And so you have YouTubers who are starting podcasts. Podcasters who are becoming YouTubers. And it’s really just becoming this sort of influencer world, where the biggest stars are doing live tours. They’re releasing books; they have merch lines. They’re kind of building 360 businesses around themselves. And even the audio brands that maybe don’t have that one star talent, and they’re not a Top 50 show themselves, are also trying to find audiences on video, because the algorithms there are just so strong. So that’s kind of how we got to this point. Warzel: So is part of the YouTube thing, I think—YouTube’s so interesting, right? Because it is, as you put it, it’s this, like, sleeping giant. It’s been massive for so long. It’s been this, you know, big revenue creator through ads for so many different people. It’s also this massive, massive cultural ecosystem, that people are spending unfathomable amounts of time there. And yet, if you’re like an executive or someone who’s not of that world, it might not be something that you know to go to. Right. And so I feel like YouTube kind of comes for everyone there. But my question to you: Is the reason for this pivot that just, like, you don’t need a ton of overhead? You don’t need, you know, this big investment. And YouTube sort of gives you this access to this massive audience, where you can then sell a lot of ads and then make a lot of money. Like, is that the reason for the YouTube pivot? Carman: I actually think that that’s in the “cons” category. Warzel: Oh, really? Carman: Because audio is so much cheaper to make. You don’t have to hire video editors; you don’t have to learn to edit video. I mean, part of being in video is doing clips. People are spending money on clippers. I mean, that’s like a whole economy in itself. So it’s actually more expensive to have a video operation. But the thing that video offers is these algorithms. And I think when Spotify first got into the space, podcasters—like traditional podcasters in the audio world—were really excited, because Spotify was the one behind Discover Weekly. So people thought, Well, they’re going to be able to do what they did for music, but for podcasts. They’re actually going to make it so it’s easier to discover shows, and it won’t just be word-of-mouth. That didn’t really end up panning out. And what people found instead was that if we have video clips on TikTok, or reels now—or if we’re just on YouTube—those services are amazing at showing you the content you want to see. And that includes podcasts. Whether we would’ve thought of them as podcasts to begin with in the first place is a whole different question. But that’s why they really started to turn to video. Warzel: Is there more to that? Because I think actually like from the layperson, there’s this, you know—people pivoted from all their bespoke podcast apps. And a lot of people are listening to their podcasts now on something like Spotify. And I think there’s this sense that actually, like, it did work out. Maybe not from an industry standpoint. But like, can you walk me through a little, just beyond the discovery mechanism? What were some of the other reasons that it just didn’t go the way that they thought it would? Carman: Well, audio can be cheap to make. But if you’re doing narrative series that require reporters essentially going on assignment for weeks, months, at a time—it’s very well-thought-out and a long project that’s expensive to make. And one of the studios that Spotify was working with, and acquired, was Gimlet Studios. And they were known for these really gorgeous, long-form shows. I think at some point they were kind of dubbed “the HBO of podcasting.” And that’s where the economics, I think, became more difficult. So you had these chat shows, that I think now are what’s known in the business. And everyone, when they think of a podcast, probably thinks of a chat show. But there is this whole other strain of podcasting. That again, coming out of the public-radio world, was kind of what podcasting was. I mean, this is Serial. It’s narrative. It takes a long time. It’s gorgeously edited; it requires on-the-ground reporting. And that’s not cheap to make. So I think people were looking maybe at a different format that didn’t end up panning out. And those shows still exist, but it’s just not going to be the biggest moneymaker in the world, comparatively at least. Warzel: You know, I think when we think about this move toward video, especially in this space. And also sort of like the move where like, you know, I’ve noticed the thing—a lot of people have pointed out, on TikTok, where folks sort of set up their situation to make it look like they’re conducting a podcast. Like, they have a podcast—and they don’t even have one. Carman: The fake podcasts. Charlie: The fake podcast. That, to me, is wild. And such a fascinating little, like, growth hack or whatever. But I’m curious—this is obviously, people say “the pivot to video.” And that is very—there’s a lot of baggage with that phrase, right? Like I worked at at Buzzfeed in the 2010s. Like, I know about these dreaded “everyone moves and pivots to video.” And then the platforms change what they care about, how they wanna do things. And everyone’s left holding the bag. This feels different to me, right? This feels, to me, a little more sustainable. How does it feel to you? Does this feel like a trend or a fad? Or is this an actual sort of, like, more of a reliable shift in consumer behavior and the way that we’re making things? Carman: So there’s two sides to this. The YouTube side of—people love to get into the debate of, like, Are people watching, or are they just having it on in the background? Like, are they really watching the video? And we could talk about that. But generally speaking, are people using YouTube to consume podcasts? Yeah, just generally. I think that’s here to stay. I think that’s a thing. Yes. Do I think podcasters are influencers and can drive purchasing decisions, and belong within that broader creator economy? Yes. Now, where I would say it’s a little murkier is—and we haven’t really talked about this part of the pivot to video—but there’s been a pivot to video in the sense that either traditional media, like a Fox News, for example, or CNN, as well as streamers like a Netflix, or a Tubi, are looking at podcasts as programming that they can put on their airwaves. Basically. And so I think the question for that is: Do people want to watch a podcast on Netflix? Or do people wanna stick around on Hulu and watch the companion podcast to Dancing With the Stars? Those are the questions where I think that user behavior is still a little bit—I’m not sure. But that’s … again, it’s so nascent. This is just starting out, truly, within the past year. Within the past months, even. Warzel: You spoke earlier about—we can get into this about whether, you know, people are watching these things like second screen, first screen. Like, I am a little curious in what you’re hearing about the cultural bit of this. To me it feels like some of this video-podcasting boom has to do a little bit with the intensity of the parasocial relationship between a lot of these creators or podcasters or journalists or whoever. Right. The idea of like, Hey, I wanna see what their room looks like. I need to know what they look like, how they say these things, what their, you know, gestures are, and facial features. And all that jazz. I’m curious. Like, is this pivot, some of it, just because—like you said—the YouTube algorithm’s really good for this? There’s a lot of money to be made there. Like, I guess how important is the video component of this? Like, are you getting the sense that people are really watching and engaging with it in that way? Or is it kind of like—it is just the second-screen content for the most part? And it just so happens to be on this bigger platform? Carman: I do think video’s important. And because, again, going back to kind of the beginning of podcasting. Journalists, maybe guests you didn’t know about. Podcasting is now sort of a substitute for daytime TV and late-night TV. And so, you have celebrities not only hosting these shows, but coming on as guests quite frequently, as part of the PR strategy to go on podcasts now. [Music] Warzel: So I think that Ashley is just dead-on here. This idea that podcasts have essentially become a replacement for daytime TV and also late night on video. You’ve got these celebrities and these interesting public figures and documentaries and news, and it’s all mashed up into usually lower-production-value versions of cable news and late-night formats. And, a lot like regular TV, the shows just autoplay one after another. There’s always something on next. Except this time, it’s ostensibly tailored to your interests. I think that the daytime-TV cable replacement is borne out by a lot of the data, too. YouTube just keeps growing. That is in part because some of the biggest consumers of daytime TV are going to Netflix to watch this content on their TV during the day. Nielsen data from this year shows that adults 65 and up nearly doubled their YouTube viewing on TV over the last two years. This is the group of people who are traditionally at home, have a lot of time on their hands. And they’ve discovered YouTube and are going to it. But this TV-ification of podcasts, I don’t think is a unique phenomenon. In fact, I think that the gravitational pull of media seems to be pushing everything into this similar short-formed video. It’s this idea that my former colleague and podcaster Derek Thompson has written about recently. His take is that everything is television now. That that might actually have a lot to say about our fragmented and even lonely culture. I brought him on to talk about it. [Music] Warzel: Derek Thompson, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Thompson: Great to be here, man. Thank you. Warzel: So you wrote a piece not too long ago that, in very classic Derek form, takes like a bunch of different disparate thoughts and puts them into sort of a grand theory of culture and attention. That theory is that everything is television. I’m just curious. At the outset, like, what got you started on this? Because this feels like this is one of those that, like, comes about after it’s been kind of ruminating in the back of the brain. And you’re just, like, gathering examples and data for a long time. But how—what’s the spark, the genesis for this? Thompson: I think you pretty much nailed it. You know, Charlie, it’s almost as if you and I do more or less the same thing for a living, that you read this article and understood its germination. Precisely. I mean, it really did start with—I host a podcast with the Ringer Podcast Network, which is owned by Spotify, called Plain English. And the Ringer is moving a lot of their podcasts to video. And first they were moving it to YouTube, and now they recently signed a contract with Netflix that some of their podcasts are being moved to Netflix. And so they came to me and they said, We wanna make plain-English, essentially a YouTube show, slash, eventually maybe a Netflix show. I got into podcasting precisely because it wasn’t television. I like listening to podcasts, not watching them. I listen to podcasts when I go on a walk with my dog. I listen to podcasts when I’m making coffee. I listen to podcasts when I’m commuting to work. I love that I can do something else that it only occupies one sensory stream and doesn’t command all of the sensory streams. I don’t need to touch it. I don’t need to taste it. Warzel: Preach. Thompson: I just need to listen to it. And so my initial response was like, “No, I don’t wanna do that; Plain English is a podcast. I don’t want it to be television.” And then they, you know, suggested that I look at some of the data. And the data very clearly showed that video podcasts, including on Spotify, are growing something like 20 times faster than non-video podcasts. And to the extent that I, Derek, am in the business of trying to get the software of my ideas running on the hardware of other people’s brains as efficiently as possible, it makes no freaking sense for me to not make this show a television show. And so I was thinking about that, and being like kind of mad about it. Because I’m eventually just going to, you know, make it a video show. And then I read this FTC report where Meta, in a case that was ultimately successful against the FTC, the FTC says: Meta, you’re a monopoly. Meta says, No we’re not. And in one filing to prove that Meta was not a monopoly, in this lawsuit, they said, Look, we’re not a social-media monopoly because we’re not a social-media company. The vast, vast majority of the videos that people watch aren’t from their friends at all. They’re from random strangers that are essentially making videos that are basically like short-form television. So here Meta is, with their back against the wall, telling the U.S. government: We’re not a social-media company; we’re television. And I was like, Oh, this is a story. And now I just need to find a third thing. And then that third thing was Sora 2 and Vibes, the Facebook equivalent of Sora 2, which is an AI platform. Essentially you have these people who are working on, like, the ultimate creation. Like they’re trying to invent God. They’re trying to invent a silicon brain that is smarter than any human brain at everything. And on the way to inventing God, they’re like, Oh, let’s essentially build a TikTok, but for AI-generated videos. Which is essentially just more short-form video on our phones; it’s more TV. And so, tic-tac-toe. I put those things together—and I was like, I’m just going to write that everything is becoming television, and hopefully, having a ride at that theory, backfill it with a lot of other research that I’ll do. So that’s what I did. I said, “Everything is television.” And then the rest of the article sort of flowed from there. Warzel: I can sympathize with that completely. Hey. I feel like, you know, I had a conversation with somebody, a political-science professor who I was talking to a couple years ago, who actually like, scared the crap outta me. Because they, they were like, Listen, man, I hang out with young people. And, like, no one’s ever going to read again. Truly, it was one of the reasons I left The New York Times. I was just so rattled by this thing. I was like, I need to start a Substack; like now. You know, like be someplace different. Of course, you know, retreating into words. But, you know, one of the things that they were mentioning to me, and it wasn’t really like “everything was television.” But it was like: Go take a look at, like, how kids are expressing themselves. Or like kids, younger people, are expressing themselves on TikTok. And it was like, every single one of them is doing a Jon Stewart or a Tucker Carlson, or, you know, a John Oliver–style impression. Like delivering a monologue to camera, and there’s like a screen grab of, you know, like a tweet or something that they’re talking about, that’s right there. Yeah. And I mean, you know, now you have obviously influencers with, like, the fake cable-news chirons underneath their YouTube videos and stuff. But it felt, too, like not only was the form changing in terms of you know, short-form video movement and popularity. But it was also like, people were legitimately aping the style. Thompson: It’s like they grew up on. It’s a little bit like: So I have a two-year-old, and one of the first games that she loved to play is I’m a monster and she’s prey. So I pretend to be a monster, and she pretends to run away from me. And I have all sorts of stupid evolutionary-psychology reasons about why parents have it somehow ingrained in them to pretend to be monsters—to teach our children to run away from danger. That’s not what this is about, though. It’s about: Eventually she turned two, and now she likes to be the monster, and I’m the prey. Right? And so, like, this is essentially what’s happening, but with television. It’s like these people who grew up basking in the glow of John Oliver and, you know, The Daily Show, are like: Okay, well, now I’m starting to walk on my two feet, and I’m just going to, like, make that exact same thing, but using TikTok. And so this is how I think, you know, the post-literate world sort of feeds on itself, right? People who are brought up in television want to express themselves in television. Which means the next microgeneration grows up watching those people express themselves in television and think, Oh, you know, image and video and straight-to-camera charisma; it’s just the way you communicate big ideas. And so that’s why, you know, a big part of me wonders whether the era of reading, like the literate world, might have just been this little tiny bubble that existed in human history. And we’re just going right back to just … we’re all oral apes, and television is just going to be everything. Warzel: Do you get that sense? Do you feel like it will continue to like contract into a smaller, more granular form? We talk so much about short-form video content being, like, a primary way people are expressing themselves. A primary way people who are younger, especially, want to consume media. And yet also, like these podcasts are like usually pretty long too, right? Like, the form seems to be pretty elastic in that way. Do you feel like time matters much in all this? Thompson: So I think that culture is always strange, and it’s always backlashing on itself. Which means you often have barbell effects. For example, in music in the 2010s. I remember as streaming was taking off, vinyl was taking off as well. Now it wasn’t taking off the same way it took off in like the 1940s, 1950s, but vinyl sales were growing a lot. And so sometimes what you have is: One trend becomes so obvious that there becomes a cultural backlash to it, and then that feeds another sort of coexisting trend. So one could tell a story. Like if I was going to report out a sort of second “Everything is television, part two” essay, one could tell a story that says, Well everything is becoming television with TikTok and with reels and with AI and with YouTube podcasts—but also Substack is big, and more people are reading. Like, you know, if you look at the people reading with The New York Times and The Atlantic, there’s lots of folks who—and maybe even a growing number of people—who are reading text. I just think that there’s something to this notion that television—and by television, here, I’m really relying on Raymond Williams, who wrote a 1974 book called Television Technology and Cultural Form, where he said, television, to him, meant a continuous flow of episodic video. And so in a way, based on that 1974 definition, TikTok and reels are even more television than television. Right? Continuous flow of episodic video. I do think there’s something to this idea that there’s an attractor state in media, such that many different enterprises and many different motivations become television. So Facebook began as a student directory. It became television. AI started trying to create superintelligence. They became television. I wanted to just make a radio show. I became television. Charlie just wants to write words in paragraphs— Warzel: That’s all I want. Thompson: Like, leave him alone. Just let the man write words in paragraphs. What are we doing right now? We’re talking on Riverside, where I can see your face, and you can see my face, because I’m assuming this is a podcast. That we will eventually have some video component, and maybe more people will watch it as TV than listen to it as a podcast. So there is something to this idea that television is an attractor state. And no matter where you begin in your media journey—A) I wanna make a student directory; B) I just want make a superintelligence; C) I just want to make radio for the internet—you end up in TV. Because that’s just where the eyeballs flow. So I’m always willing to hear a backlash argument and be there for the idea that, like, not everything becomes one thing in a messy culture. But man, it really does seem like everything wants to become television. Warzel: You know, to this point—you wrote that you talked about the format of it and the idea of all of this flow. All of this, you know, volume of television that we have. Or, you know, video-based media. And something that I really liked that you wrote was that television’s not really meant to absorb our attention as much as maybe, like—you know, scratch away at it. Or I think you said “dab away at it.” Thompson: Dab away at it. Warzel: Right. But the idea that there is this sort of—I mean, this is the idea of the second screen, right? This is the idea of sort of creating things that make someone feel comfortable, or that there’s something on in the room that there’s presence. Or whatnot. And I think that’s really interesting. I had—before you, I was talking to Ashley Carman, who, you know, writes about all of this stuff and reports on the podcasting industry for Bloomberg. And her takeaway from all of this is like, yeah, podcasts are becoming daytime-TV now, right? Like, you don’t really turn on Ellen; you don’t have this thing you just throw on whatever. And, you know, Derek’s there. It is just sort of like—we don’t have to pay these people; you know, we don’t have to get these nice sets and have the studio audience clapping and do all that stuff. And all that overhead. We can just have, you know, face-for-radio Charlie, talking to you. And have it on in the background. And YouTube serves the greatest function that it can serve. There is the recommendation engine and the autoplay. Right? And I just wonder—I mean, how do you think we make media in that world to be part of, like, a autoplay carousel? It feels very disjointed and almost a little bit sad. Thompson: Yeah. Uh, there’s so many thoughts that I had as you were saying that; I wanna make sure that I, like, find a way to sort of put them all on. Warzel: I don’t ask concise questions. Thompson: I’m trying to, like, put all those gemstones in one necklace essentially. Okay. So people sometimes talk about, like, “lean-forward media” versus “lean-back media.” And maybe that’s the wrong dichotomy. Like, lean-forward versus lean-back, I think, speaks this idea that, like … when I’m reading a hard novel, I’m leaning forward. And when I’m watching stupid television, I’m leaning back. But now that there’s so much television—and by television I mean there’s TV on our phones, there’s TV on iPads, there’s TV on our actual TV. In a way, we don’t really pay that close attention to a lot of the television that’s playing around us. We kind of soak in it, right? It’s like, you turn on Netflix. And I don’t know if my wife’s going to be listening to this, but I hope I’m not burning her too bad. Sometimes it’ll happen with my wife, and we’ll talk about a show we really want to watch; a movie we really want to watch. And we’ll turn it on, and then we’ll immediately recognize that one or the other one has picked up their phone. Just look at their phone within like three minutes. It’s like, I thought you really wanted to watch this. And it’s like—I do, but “watch” doesn’t mean watch. Right, “watch” means, like, have it on. And I wonder whether what’s happening to media is: People almost don’t know how to be alone without it. We need something to be churning on in the background. We need something to be sort of like swimming in, media-wise. Otherwise we feel almost too alone with ourselves. I mean, I’ll sometimes feel this about podcasts. I could be walking down the street, and I’ll be like, Wow; I’m just listening to myself think. Maybe I should put on Bill Simmons. Right. And it’s easier now, I think, especially when you’re sitting down at home or at work or in a bedroom to just put on lots of media. And just have it, like, basking around you, surrounding you. And that does create a weird world where no one’s fully watching any particular thing. And Netflix has clearly responded to this. I thought it was amazing: In my reporting, there was an essay that was written by Will Lan. We reported that screenwriters working for Netflix have sometimes heard a note from company executives for their television shows—that the characters have to announce what they’re doing so that viewers of the program who just have it on the background can follow along. Because otherwise, like, complex plots are just too much. Because no one’s paying attention on a second-to-second basis. And so I just think there’s something to this idea that—as everything becomes television and no one can fully pay attention to any one thing for a really long period of time—it all just becomes different kinds of wallpaper for us. And that’s a very strange, I think, phenomenon. Warzel: Yeah. Do you think it’s … this is just a very sort of personal, your journalistic-philosophy-type thing. How much do you try to lean out of that? Right? Because I think—you know, what you said before at the very outset of this. The software of your ideas into, like, the hardware of other people in the world, right? And so I’m just—I’m curious how you think about that. Because there’s a way in which it’s so disenchanting to hear. You know, like it’s all wallpaper. And like, I guess like the media version of trying to announce what the plot is, is like just bashing people over the head with very blunt, sort of, maybe dumbed-down ideas. I’m just curious: Like, how much do you think about having to chase that idea and sort of embrace this notion of: I’m going to get the audience wherever, wherever I can, however I can. Versus that sort of hard … like the work that usually comes through in the text, right? Which is like footnotes and citing and block quotes. And the, you know, real kind of granular data. How do you parse that yourself? Thompson: Yeah. I mean, you’re scratching it like a huge existential question. Which is like: Why do I do what I do? Like, why do we do what we do? And I ask myself this from time to time. Sometimes it’s almost like a facial wrinkle that you find for the first time at 39. Like, you don’t wanna look too closely at it. But I think my answer is something like this: I’m not trying to optimize my audience for size. If that was my goal, if my No. 1 goal was to have the biggest possible audience, I would just lie. I would lie constantly. I would lie about conspiracy theories. I would lie about important figures. I would take tremendous and liberal advantage of the First Amendment and just lie constantly, without any concept of a personal integrity. What do I actually enjoy about the job? I really enjoy writing pieces, like everything is television. I enjoy figuring stuff out. I enjoy having theories about the world. I enjoy having those theories interrogated. I enjoy learning where I was wrong, and then writing a new theory. I love coming up with ideas like “Abundance,” where not only is it fun to write the original essay, but also it’s fun to talk to people about it when it catches on with other people. And so that’s where I’m basically thinking: All right. I want to have conversations with people on my podcast that are turned into essays that deal with culture and science and technology and politics. And I think the best way to have those conversations in a way that reaches the people who would be most likely to be interested in those ideas is to make my podcast a television show. But this question of like, why do I do what I do is like—I’m always coming back to it. Because I think it’s a good, big, important question. And more people, I think, would be better served by consistently, like, checking back in with themselves about What exactly am I trying to do in this life? Warzel: I wanted to sort of end here and talk about, you know—your essay ends on a slightly ominous note, right? Like this idea you’ve done a lot of writing and reporting on—the antisocial century and notion that people are are alone and struggling in a lot of ways. And also the technology is sort of enabling that disconnect, right? This idea of like, things in the background all the time; shortened attention spans. Less ability to engage with these ideas; less ability to engage with one’s own ideas. Or just like, you know, to be able to put something on that can serve as a buffer from reality, in whatever way. Even if that means, like, going out and seeing friends or doing whatever. I think it’s very easy to get pretty, you know, sort of staring off into the void on a lot of these things. But I’m curious if anything’s changed since you’ve written that. Like, do you feel like if we don’t find, you know, ways to put guardrails a little bit around this societal tendency—to kind of move toward that, down the funnel to the sort of the easiest, most frictionless thing in terms of media consumption, in terms of whatever—that we’re headed toward this dangerous place? Or, how are you thinking about that now? Is it still kind of this ominous feeling that you have, or has stuff changed? Thompson: I feel pretty ominous about the future, and it’s partly because I’m not sure that we’re made to broadcast. Like, as a species. And there’s something actually very hard and discomfiting and unusual about speaking to a thousand people at once, or a hundred thousand people at once, or a million people at once, or many millions of people at once—as many podcasters are. That’s a very strange thing. It’s surely doesn’t seem like it’s something that’s natural to our mammalian history. There’s several studies that suggest that the tenor of our conversations changes significantly when we move from one-to-one interactions to one-to-1,000 interactions. If I recall, there was a study that was done asking people to write notes to one person versus writing a note that would be read by a thousand people. And the note to that one person asked a lot about that other person. But the note to the thousand people just reflected on themselves. Because how can you possibly have a personal conversation with a thousand people at once? You can’t. And so the idea from this study, which I think was done by Jonah Berger at Wharton, was that when we broadcast, because we can’t look outside of ourselves, all who we’re broadcasting to: We look inside of ourselves. And just talk about ourselves. Which suggests that a world in which our children are raised, and we raise ourselves, around broadcast media is a world where we’re more fixated on ourselves rather than focus on other people. And that’s a place where maybe “everything is television” and “the antisocial century” sort of come together. There’s a weird way I think in that our aloneness, as I said in that essay, or our alone time is less alone than it used to be. And our time with other people is more alone than it used to be. That is, when you are alone—by yourself on a couch—you don’t actually have to be fully alone. You can pull out your phone and be on social media and immediately, boom, get into a fight with someone about politics. Right? So your alone time can be weirdly synthetically social. But also, when you’re surrounded by other people, if you go to a party, you can choose to be alone whenever you want. You can stand in the corner and pull out your phone. And then boom—suddenly you’re alone. And so I think that these technologies are changing us in ways that are both talked about all the time, right? Rise of anxiety, rise of narcissism. And they’re changing us in ways that I think might be, like, underconsidered, undertheorized. They’re changing so much about what it means to be a person, and what it means to be able to sit still with oneself. And it, therefore, raises questions about: Do you actually need to sit still by yourself and listen to your thoughts, ever? Like, is that good for you at all? Should you just always choose to download other people’s thoughts inside of your brain, so you’re never stuck with the sort of subvocal questions of your own consciousness? I feel honest about this, because I’m not sure that these are, like, familiar feelings. I feel like we’re sort of being thrust into, again, a kind of really unnatural experiment based on these technologies. And given the changes in mental health over the last few decades, it’s not entirely clear to me if surrounding ourselves with the constant—bombarding ourselves with the constant thoughts for the people—is particularly good for our sanity. So, I don’t feel great about it. But also in the biggest picture, I am dispositionally an optimist. And I would hope that if you look at the history of something like the printing press—well, clearly the printing press contributed to enormous warfare throughout Europe, over the rise of Protestantism and the wars within Christianity for decades, even centuries. But also, like: I’m very glad that books exist. So I hope that we don’t have wars that kill tens of millions of people over short-form video. But also I think that maybe one lesson of the printing press is that really destabilizing technologies have a period of destabilization, but ultimately we find some way to use them so that we can get the most out of them. And, maybe the same way that we’re mourning the printing press—or the fruits of the printing press right now, which is to say reading on pulp—who knows, maybe a hundred years from now we’re going to be mourning straight-to-camera video, because there’ll be some other media technology. And we’re like, My God, there’s the golden ages. And Derek and Charlie didn’t even know it. Warzel: I think that the part of all of this that stands out to me is that bit that you said about, like, how natural it is to broadcast. Right? And you cite a stat that I’ve seen before in the piece, I’m going to get it wrong, but it’s the ratio of how much people consume. The 99-1 rule. Ninety percent of the people consume; nine percent remix; one percent actually create. And I think about that with just the internet at large—with lurkers, right? Most people are lurkers. Most people have a great online experience, because they lurk, they consume, they find stuff. They do participate in these ways—but not in this public manner. And I think when you and I have so many conversations about whether it was the social-media revolution or the AI stuff or whatever. Going back to this idea of—as you did—the printing press and the advent of these media technologies, and how long it takes for us to sort of, you know, inoculate ourselves or develop the coping strategies. Or, you know, the social mores around these types of technologies. And I think what makes sense to me—and I have no insight as to where this could possibly go—is this idea around, like, what is out of whack right now? It’s this broadcast-and-consumption-type thing, right? There are people, it feels to me, like—it puts stresses onto people who aren’t naturally fit for that. Right. Or who just don’t even want it, and are forced into this, you know—basically orienting themselves to the world in a different way. Because that’s the only way they know how to, you know, maybe be seen. And I think figuring out how to come into a better balance, and with all of this, and all these technologies, like that’s my optimistic look. As to like, how these things can start to, you know, maybe level out a little bit more than they are. And feel a little less like, out of control. Or like, you know, everything is morphing [00:28:00] into one medium or one style. Thompson: And I guess the last thing I would say is—and this is incredibly hyper-hypocritical to come from me and to to be heard by you—I’m very happy to be in the media game, the attention game. But when I read that for five straight years, members of Generation Z have told pollsters that the thing they want more than anything when they grow up is to be an influencer, which is to say essentially be in the same attention game, I just think that’s bad. I think that there’s something about getting into this attention game—and learning its rules and realizing how catastrophe sells and realizing how conspiracy sells and realizing how negativity sells—that creates an environment of catastrophe and conspiracy and negativity. A world of too much media means a world in which the grammar of media and the psychology of media takes over things that should theoretically be a little bit more inoculated from media. I’m not sure, for example, that the right thing for our politics is for more politicians to be on TikTok. And so again, one reason why I’m a little bit—why I think the future of everything is television is somewhat ominous is that I don’t think the values and the virtues that emerge from everyone trying to become a television star are the values and virtues that people would choose if they just had tabula rasa trying to create a society. Where do we start? Right? Generosity, time for others, reflectiveness, inwardness. So, there’s lots of ways the future can go. But I absolutely feel like this is a trend that’s going to make the future feel quite weird and berserk. Warzel: And that is the music of the Galaxy Brain podcast. “Quite weird and berserk future.” Derek, thank you so much for your reporting and all your time. Thompson: Very happy to sing your theme song. Warzel: As it turns out, the reason you’re seeing my face is really complicated. Video seems to be eating the world, right—but it’s bigger than just that. This thing that I am obsessed with on the show is how the media we make, and the media we consume in aggregate, actually just tells us a lot about who we are and what we want. And how our technologies are shaping and influencing our behavior, our culture. And I think now, especially in our politics, we’re living in this lonely, fragmented, hyperactive attention economy. Right? That has opened up just a ton of possibilities for people to make things, to tell stories, to understand the world and share those understandings with others. But I think that this fragmentation can—and definitely is—leading to this inwardness, this isolation, this polarization. And I think that we’re even seeing some, in some cases, this change from a more reflective and sort of deliberative society to one that’s a lot more knee-jerk. A lot less interested in nuance. And I don’t know where any of this is heading, but I think that Derek said it best when he said that we’re kind of barreling toward this future that can feel weird and berserk. And I don’t really know where we go from here, but I can promise you that what this show’s going to try to do is: It’s going to try to chart this trajectory and just give you something to hold onto all the while.

Title: America’s Top 100 Charities: A Year Of Pain After Trump Cuts
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2025/12/12/americas-top-100-charities-a-year-of-pain-after-trump-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-12-12T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByWilliam P. Barrett, Senior Contributor. Earlier this year, Save the Children Federation, the nearly-century-old Fairfield, Conn.-based charity whose name describes its worldwide humanitarian focus, saw about half of last year’s nearly $500 million in annual U.S. Government funding evaporate. Meanwhile, New York-based International Rescue Committee (IRC), lost $400 million in U.S. funds. Originally formed to help refugees from Nazi Germany, the IRC had grown to serve the displaced around the world. “It’s a really tough time,” says Madlin Sadler, chief operating officer of the IRC, which has laid off a third of its 18,000 workers and pulled out of one country, Tanzania, with plans to leave four more due to federal funding cuts. In March, IRC ran a full-page ad in the Sunday New York Times (paid for by a private donor) beseeching other private givers to “meet the moment.” There’s no denying that’s it’s been a hard time for some of the nation’s top charities. Save the Children (STC) and IRC were sent reeling by the dramatic leveling of foreign humanitarian aid by the Trump Administration, with Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) wielding the ax. But domestic-focused charities have also had to scramble to adjust to less drastic cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and support for food banks at home. The full impact of the Trump cuts will be long debated, but early estimates are dramatic. This month the Gates Foundation estimated that 200,000 more children around the world under the age of five will die this year than last, the first rise in global infant mortality in decades. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates attributes much of this to the Trump Administration’s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. State Department unit that was the primary pump for an average of around $50 billion a year in foreign humanitarian aid. Much of this was routed through large U.S. nonprofits, which reported that income on their books as government support. Forbes’ 2025 list of America’s Top 100 Charities, released today, doesn’t directly reflect the extent of that damage, but it does show which charities were most at risk and may be deserving of your dollars now. That’s because our ranking, now in its 27th year, is designed foremost as a tool for individual donors and is based entirely on private contributions in each charity’s last reported fiscal year. In most cases, that year ended before President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. While the ranking is based on private giving, the report on each charity also details other key financial data, including government support, a metric that shows, for example, why International Rescue Committee and Save the Children were particularly vulnerable. IRC, ranked No. 37 on the new list, took in $529 million in private donations in its fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, which was dwarfed by the $967 million in direct government support it received. No. 43 Save the Children took in $470 million in private money, more than matched by $497 million from the government in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Other charities at risk from Trump’s international aid cuts: No. 15 World Vision, No. 34 Catholic Relief Services and No. 35 CARE USA. (You can view the full roster of 100 charities, and links to details about their finances here. Advice on how to use our list to analyze the finances of both the Top 100 and other smaller charities you’re considering donating to is here.) Private donations to the 100 entries on the 2025 Top Charities list rose 4.4%, beating the 2024 inflation rate of 2.9%. Collectively, they took in $66.5 billion, or 11% of the $592.5 billion given in 2024 to the country’s two million nonprofits, as measured by the Giving USA Foundation. Despite outliers like STC and IRC, government support on average came to only about one-quarter of private donations. Could private donors, spurred on by government cuts or a new tax break that kicks in next year allowing a modest charitable deduction for donors who take the standard deduction, make up for all the lost government funds? Probably not. But despite their oft-cited economic anxiety, ordinary folks are still giving. Benevity Inc., which provides a workplace donation platform to hundreds of companies, reported that donations it processed on Giving Tuesday earlier this month were up 7% from the year before. Meanwhile, a few of the richest Americans have stepped up in notable ways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency may be reeling from budget and staff cuts, but in October the private Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which both advises on responses and makes grants, announced the largest donation received in its history—$60 million from MacKenzie Scott, the break-the-mold philanthropist worth $33.6 billion, who is the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. As for Gates, in May he accelerated his timeline for donating 99% of his wealth—his Gates Foundation now plans to give away $200 billion over the next two decades as it works to prevent maternal and infant deaths and fight infectious diseases and poverty. The private Gates Foundation, like many charities involved with such missions, has historically tried to multiply its impact by working with government and other partners. That helps explain why some of the Top 100 Charities had become dependent on Uncle Sam’s money. Save the Children Federation, also known as Save the Children U.S., was founded in the U.S. in 1932, during the Great Depression, and modeled after a similarly named British nonprofit started after World War I. Initially, it focused on disadvantaged children in the Appalachian Mountains, and, with an emphasis on nutrition and education programs, still runs Head Start programs in rural areas across 14 U.S. states. But in recent years, three-fourths of STC’s efforts have been directed internationally, mainly through Save the Children International, a network of 30 affiliates providing relief in more than 100 countries. Difficult places Save the Children operates in includes the Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine. This year, due to reduced federal funding, the charity has pulled out of Malawi, Senegal, Brazil, Poland, Georgia and Liberia. Despite the fact that slightly more than half its funding (pre-Trump) came from the government, STC boasts some 337,000 “Mom and Pop” private donors who in 2024 contributed $87 million. Its highly visible fundraising efforts include use of such entertainment world endorsers as Jennifer Garner (who is also a trustee), Enrique Iglesias, Dakota Fanning and Olivia Wilde. “We have been accelerating our diversification of our funding and our work with the private sector,” says Clare Rodger, STC’s chief marketing and growth officer. This involves approaches like playing up specific programs and specific countries. Save The Children also has boosted its lobbying and advocacy efforts through its Save The Children Action Network, a social welfare organization with a 501(c)(4) tax status that allows political activity, including lobbying and even endorsing candidates. The IRC’s origins were life-saving but more ideological. Two predecessor groups (one blessed by Albert Einstein), were originally based in Hitler’s Germany and focused on getting political activists, intellectuals and Jews out of that country. The nonprofit later played a similar role during the 1956 uprising in Hungary against Communist rule and for much of its history was viewed by some as a stalking horse for the activist U.S. foreign policy establishment—indeed, one of its presidents, William J. Casey, later became director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Ronald Reagan. But IRC these days is more of a traditional aid agency, active in more than 40 countries. While retaining an emphasis on resettlement activities including into the U.S. (resettlements that Trump has halted), IRC has dived into war zones—Gaza, Sudan, Afghanistan and Ukraine, among others. Ciarán Donnelly, IRC’s senior vice president for international programs, says this year’s layoffs are due to U.S. government funding cuts. “It goes back to that challenge of making tough, ethical choices around what funding we have, and how do we deploy it,” he adds. IRC relies on large institutional private funders, but, like Save the Children, claims 300,000 private donors, most of them small and long-standing givers, and now needed more than ever. Vanguard Charitable, a donor-advised fund handling donations earmarked by individual donors of varying wealth, reported that $11 million went to IRC last year. Most top charities on our list are less dependent than these two on government funds. For the fourth straight year, No. 1 on our list is Feeding America, which rose to the top after the Covid 19 disruption of the economy and attention on food insecurity in the U.S. The Chicago-based umbrella for several hundred food banks around the country reported private contributions of $5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, up 1%. The bulk of that came in the form of private-sector food donations, but the charity still received nearly $300 million in cash donations. There are now eight food banks on the Top 100 Charities list. They, too, have had a trying year, with the Trump Administration cutting $500 million in emergency food aid earlier this year. (That’s before its temporary halt in SNAP food aid, a.k.a. food stamps, during the government shutdown.) No. 2 again was Good360. For the year ending December 31, 2024, the Alexandria, Va.-based clearinghouse that routes donated corporate gift-in-kind products to charities listed $3 billion in donations received, up 14%. When it comes to raising a lot of dollars from small donors, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, No. 3 on our list, remained the standout. From just a single location, the Memphis institution raised $2.8 billion in private donations in the year ending June 30, 2025, an 8% increase, while spending $431 million to do it. (You’ve seen the ads.) No. 4 was United Way Worldwide. The Alexandria, Va.-based network of more than 1,100 legally separate U.S. nonprofits emphasizing paycheck deductions had been the nation’s largest charity on our list for years until 2022, despite a steady decline due to the rise of specific-cause charities and alternative workplace giving platforms. For the year ending June 30, 2025, United Way received donations of $2.5 billion, down $10 million from the year earlier. The donation cutoff for this year’s roster—No. 100—rose 4% to a record-for-this-list: $204 million. That spot went to Wycliffe Bible Translators, of Orlando, Florida, dedicated to rendering Christianity’s holiest work into every language. Since this list is designed to inform would-be donors in the general public, we don’t look at colleges and other academic institutions soliciting specifically for themselves, on the theory their donations come primarily from their own alumni. We generally also avoid religious institutions, since they are not required to disclose financial information, and most don’t. (A notable exception is No. 6 Salvation Army, based in Alexandria, Virginia, which is technically a church as well as a major social services agency.) Read more here about our methodology for compiling the list and how this can help you evaluate any charity you consider supporting. As part of our due diligence for donors, we also report for each charity such metrics as overhead, fundraising costs, charitable commitment (how much goes to program support), and how much the top earning employee at each organization is paid. A record 31 of the 100 nonprofits on our list reported total compensation of more than $1 million for at least one employee (usually the CEO), up from 28 charities last year. As in past years, the highest paid were chief executives of large nonprofit hospital/medical operations. Thomas M. Priselac, ex-CEO of Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, was the top earner, at $8.8 million. He was followed by New York’s Mount Sinai Health Systems CEO Kenneth Davis, Cleveland Clinic Foundation CEO Thomas Mihaljevic and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center CEO Selwyn Vickers, who all earned around $7 million. International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, a former British foreign secretary, received $1.2 million. Save the Children CEO Janti Soeripto earned about half of that, at $650,000. There are eight newcomers or returnees-after-a-gap to the list. In alphabetical order: Atlanta Community Food Bank (96), Breakthrough T1D (94), Combined Jewish Philanthropies (83), Covenant House (99), Fellowship of Christian Athletes (86), Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation (42), United Service Organizations (92) and World Resources Institute (85). They replaced: Father Flanagan’s Boys’ Home, Hadassah the Women’s Zionist Organization of America, Metropolitan Opera Association, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Patient Access Network Foundation, Providence St. Joseph Health, Teach for America and United Negro College Fund. The UNCF might return to our list next year, thanks to a $70 million gift it received from MacKenzie Scott in September after the close of its latest complete fiscal year. The list of the Top 100 Charities is here. A fuller description of our methodologies and how donors can use the same metrics, along with other information, to help evaluate any charity is here.

Title: The year the Big Tech job market cracked

But the tech job market had other ideas. Now, a year later, he's still looking. Despite a five-year run at Microsoft as a cloud solution architect, he said, even landing interviews has been a struggle. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. In the meantime, he's exhausted his rainy day fund and fallen behind on his mortgage payments. He's now worried he could lose his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," he said. "I'm in a very tight spot." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than 20 tech professionals for Business Insider stories who, like Khan, were struggling to find work. Many were affected by layoffs intended to right-size overhiring during the pandemic and streamline operations. US tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger, a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. Big Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees.

While much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's been cushioned by low levels of firing — but not in tech. The job market has been particularly challenging for tech professionals, who are competing not only with a growing pool of laid-off workers but also with recent college graduates and employed tech professionals looking to switch roles. At the same time, the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and application bots has made it easier for candidates to submit hundreds of applications, overwhelming some employers and making it harder for top applicants to stand out from the crowd. This surge in demand for tech roles has coincided with a decline in the supply of available openings. After peaking in 2022 following a pandemic-era hiring spree, tech job postings on Indeed are down 33% from their levels in early 2020. The roles that remain are taking longer for companies to fill, and, amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. To succeed in the 2025 tech job market, some candidates believe they need to be close to the perfect candidate. As Khan put it, "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman." Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Read more on the topic: As the hiring slowdown drags on, some tech professionals are bracing for what might await them in today's job market. In October, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, a move CEO Andy Jassy said was intended to reshape the company's culture. Business Insider spoke with six affected employees about how they were coping with the news. Most began searching for new roles soon after they learned they'd been laid off, in part because they felt the tech job market could be very challenging. John Paul Martinez, formerly a technical support engineer at Amazon, said the prospect of competing with thousands of other laid-off tech workers — from Amazon and beyond — has left him anxious about the search ahead. "I am extremely fearful of the competition," said the 35-year-old, who lives in Orlando. Since 2022, Big Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla have collectively announced layoffs of more than 125,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. The roughly 34,000 layoffs from these companies so far this year — most of them tied to cuts at Amazon and Microsoft — mark a 65% increase over 2024. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for our newsletter. This influx of job seekers has helped fuel intense competition for roles across the economy. Last quarter, the average job opening received 242 applications — nearly triple the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. James Hwang, a former Amazon IT support engineer, said the hiring landscape has been just as tough as advertised. "The current job market has been crazy hard," said the 27-year-old, who lives in Michigan. "I've already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet." For many tech professionals, landing a Big Tech job is the ultimate goal. But in today's market, some have decided to broaden their horizons. After losing his contract role as an engineering program manager at Apple in September 2024, Lee Givens Jr. struggled to find work. Given his prior experience in Big Tech at Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, he initially focused his search on similar companies — but was unable to gain traction. That changed when he stopped limiting his search to Big Tech. In April, he landed a product manager role at a Toyota subsidiary. Givens said his total compensation is significantly higher than it was at Apple — and that he feels he's making more of an impact than he could at a larger tech corporation. After 17 years at Microsoft, Eduardo Noriega was laid off from his senior software engineering role in May. Instead of looking for another Big Tech job, he pivoted full-time to the staffing firm he'd spent nearly a decade building — a business he'd started partly as a cushion in case a layoff ever came. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." However, some workers are still finding ways to land roles at Big Tech companies. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen was laid off in May from her user researcher role. By October, she was working at Meta as a user experience researcher — a position she landed after receiving a referral from a connection. In June, shortly before graduation, Andrew Chen landed a software engineering role at Amazon. He said posting about his interview prep journey on TikTok helped keep him accountable — and opened the door to advice from others who'd been through the process. While some tech job seekers have managed to break through, many told Business Insider they're still searching for work — both in and outside Big Tech. For those still struggling, the challenge isn't just refining their job search strategy — it's also figuring out how to soften the financial blow of losing a paycheck. After being laid off from his technical program manager position at Microsoft, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he put his belongings in storage and moved to Florida to live with family, hoping to save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." Jump to

Tomb Raider: Catalyst has been confirmed to be landing on PC (via Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S when it releases sometime in 2027. Currently, no Switch 2 releases have been announced; but worry not, Nintendo fans, there is still hope. The Switch 2 does support some games that were developed on Unreal Engine 5, just like Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Games such as Cronos: The New Dawn, Fortnite, and Split Fiction all run on the new hybrid console. So, there is always a chance that Tomb Raider: Catalyst could be added to our list of upcoming Switch 2 games in the future. Stay tuned for updates. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be following Lara Croft on a new adventure as she heads to North India after a mystical cataclysm has unleashed ancient secrets and forces that guard them. It's up to the badass treasure hunter to uncover the truth behind the event and also work to stop those who seek to use the mysterious power for their own benefit. The stakes are pretty high in the story, too, since it will be up to you to prevent a full-blown catastrophe that could very well shape the future. Exciting times! While we don't have many story-specific details, we do know the upcoming game is serving as a new chapter in the Tomb Raider franchise. Although it's technically set after the events of the Legend trilogy, you don't need to play those titles or the reboot trilogy either to get up to speed. This timeline information was confirmed to us by Will Kerslake, the Game Director of Crystal Dynamics, during a chat about the future title. "From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld, with the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft. But what’s important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he explained. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone." Like past Tomb Raider games, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is a single-player action-adventure game that will have you stepping into the shoes of Lara Croft. This is going to be a story-driven game, with Alix Wilton Regan (from Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect 3, and Cyberpunk 2077 fame) voicing Lara Croft. So expect to see some cinematic moments and get ready to buckle in for a more linear kind of adventure. In a press release for the game, it was also confirmed that players will get to explore the largest Tomb Raider map we've ever had. Along with exploration that is apparently increasing in scale, players can also look forward to diving into tombs that are packed with intricate puzzles to solve. So far, it sounds like everything you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game, just taken up a notch. However, we are still waiting on more gameplay reveals to show us more information on what kind of new mechanics and environmental puzzles will be on offer. Combat details and enemy encounters are also being kept under lock and key currently, so hopefully, we will get more news on those soon. While we wait for more details, you can check out our list of the best action games to play today to keep you busy. Crystal Dynamics has been developing Tomb Raider: Catalyst since 2022, back when its partnership with Amazon Game Studios was first announced. If you need a Tomb Raider refresher, Crystal Dynamics has been making games for the series since 2006's Tomb Raider: Legend. The studio is also known for the Legacy of Kain and Gex series, so in terms of action-adventure outings, the studio is as experienced as you can get. Tomb Raider Catalyst is being developed on Unreal Engine 5, and according to a press release following the upcoming game's official reveal at The Game Awards, Scot Amos, Head of Studio at Crystal Dynamics, has stated that the team is looking to push boundaries and innovate the series, thanks to Amazon Game Studios' support. "Our collaboration with Amazon Game Studios has been truly transformative for these ambitious projects," he writes. "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise. With Tomb Raider: Catalyst, we're crafting our most expansive and innovative Tomb Raider adventure yet." It should be noted that in 2025, Crystal Dynamics had three rounds of layoffs that affected various projects and departments in the studio. But it seems like Tomb Raider is safe from any potential cancellations for now, thanks to a reassuring LinkedIn post shared by the developer in November 2025. The post reads: "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future." We'll keep you posted on any further news that comes our way, but things seem to be on course right now, which is a great sign.

Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis? Choose your Lara If you're staying up all night to watch The Game Awards 2025, follow along with our live coverage. If you want an early night, you can catch up on all the news with our Everything Announced at The Game Awards 2025 roundup. The "future of Tomb Raider" has been dutifully revealed at this year's Geoff Awards, and it turns out the future is half-future, half-past. Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics have announced a pair of Tomb Raider games - Tomb Raider: Catalyst, the next major new instalment in Lara Croft's adventures, and the previously leaked Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, "a fully reimagined version" of Core Design's original Tomb Raider from 1996. Let’s start with Catalyst. It’s been in development at Crystal Dynamics since they partnered with Amazon Game Studios back in 2022, and is set in Northern India following “a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them”. Lara is racing various cackling badniks to claim yet another mighty treasure with the apparent power to reshape the geography underfoot. “As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future,” the press release declares. Here’s a video. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be the “largest Tomb Raider world yet”, with all the forgotten crypts and puzzles one might expect of a game featuring Indiana Jones’s sister from another mother. (Dear precious commenters, please find a way to make that rhyme - it’s 3am here and there is no poetry left in my bloodstream.) It’ll launch in 2027 for PC via Steam. Before that, though, you’ll be able to play Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which is being developed by Crystal and Shadow Warrior devs Flying Wild Hog. This also runs in Unreal Engine 5, and boasts of “new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game”. You’ll once again be hunting for the Scion, another momentous McGuffin that must be kept out of dastardly hands, and yes, the dinosaurs are still in it. Ah, my friend the T-Rex. It has been too long since you last chased me screaming around that cave. Look out for these and other hand-Crofted pseudo-vintage delights via Steam in 2026. Both the Catalyst and Legacy Of Atlantis incarnations of Croft are being voiced by Alix Wilton Regan - aka the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition, also known for roles in Mass Effect 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. It's been a very rough time for Crystal Dynamics this year, with three rounds of layoffs in swift succession. The last of those came in November, when the studio announced that "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" had been let go. Naturally, the press release for Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis paints a rosier picture, with Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos commenting that "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise." As for the remake, Wild Hog CEO Michał Szustak assures that "we’re expanding the universe while staying loyal to what fans have always loved." Time for another volcanic argument about tank controls, I guess. Games aside, Amazon are also working on a TV adaptation of Lara's adventures.

Since then, Eidos Montreal and its sister studio Crystal Dynamics have changed hands, leaving Square Enix and being sold to Embracer Group. Unfortunately, in keeping with much of the rest of the gaming industry, Crystal Dynamics has also had multiple rounds of layoffs through 2022.
