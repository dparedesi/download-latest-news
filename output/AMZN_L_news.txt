President Trump has been thinking outside the box, unleashing Elon Musk with his army of young tech prodigies, and doing what he said he would. His opponents are overwhelmed, and even his supporters cannot always get their heads around what he is doing. So here is a special Shock and Awe Miscellany. . . Do we really want Gaza? How can tariffs help our economy? Slashing the government. President Trump has had his eye on Canada and Greenland, hoping to make America great again by means of territorial acquisition. Whether or not that should be pursued, I can see the attraction of Greenland, with its immense mineral wealth and strategic location, and Canada, a developed Western nation that would be the equivalent in population and liberalism of a California North. But now the president has another territory he would like for the United States to have: Gaza, the 25 mile long by 3.7 to 7.5 mile wide strip of land bordering Israel, the Mediterranean Sea, and Egypt. Which is the site of the bloody war between Israel and Hamas. My question is, WHY? After a meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, who is open to the idea, President Trump said this, according to the transcript: “I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there and frankly who’s been really very unlucky. It’s been very unlucky. It’s been an unlucky place for a long time. “Being in its presence just has not been good and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there. Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly bad luck. “This can be paid for by neighbouring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and we’ll make sure something really spectacular is done. “They’re going to have peace. They’re not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilisation of wonderful people has had to endure. The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down. “They’re living under fallen concrete that’s very dangerous and very precarious. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area … do a real job, do something different. America’s top three trading partners, combining both imports and exports, are Mexico ($798 billion), Canada ($773 billion), and China ($575 billion). Together, they account for 42% of America’s trade. Last week, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on goods coming in from China. Those countries have vowed to retaliate with tariffs against American products. The reason the president gave for hitting our allies, with whom we have a free trade agreement negotiated by President Trump himself, over twice as hard as our adversary China, is that Mexico and Canada are not doing enough to stop illegal immigrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Also that those porous borders are letting in the deadly drug Fentanyl. At this action, the stock market plunged, since the U.S. economy is highly dependent on world trade, both imports for our supply chains and consumer goods and exports, to sell U.S. products. But by the end of the week, both Mexico and Canada agreed to put 10,000 troops along the border to deter illegal immigrants and Fentanyl smuggling. So the president paused the tariffs for 30 days. So perhaps the threat of the tariffs was just the president throwing the nation’s weight around, a way to force countries to comply with our demands. And yet, President Trump likes tariffs, calling them “the greatest things ever invented,” and the duty on China’s products remains and is likely to go higher. (He earlier proposed a 60% tariff on China.) My question is, how would it be possible to implement such tariffs without triggering massive inflation? Importers always add the duty fees to the cost of the product. That would inflate the prices of just about everything Americans buy on Walmart and Amazon. But that’s not all. If tariffs are successful in limiting the amount of imports, so that more people “buy American,” the drop in overall supply plus the greater demand for domestically-produced goods will also send prices higher. The hope is that tariffs will help American manufacturing, but American industries are highly dependent on other countries for raw materials and parts necessary for their supply line. In time, the American economy could probably adjust, but that will take a long and painful time. Meanwhile, the loss of foreign markets for American products can only mean hard times for our companies, layoffs for our workers, and hardship for our farmers. Is there a way that high tariffs (traditionally a policy favored by liberal Democrats) could possibly help the American economy? To his credit, President Trump is slashing the overgrown federal government. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is decimating the federal work force and is eliminating entire agencies. To those who complain that no one elected Musk, I would say that no one elected the IRS agent who collected my taxes or the TSA agent who screened me at the airport. They were simply acting by virtue of the authority given to them by the Executive Branch of the government, under the auspices of the President of the United States. Musk is acting on the authority of the democratically-elected president, who is the head of said Executive Branch. One casualty was the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was completely eliminated, with its foreign aid function transferred to the State Department. Observes John Daniel Davidson, “In the six decades since it was established, USAID has gone from fighting poverty, spreading American ideals, and undercutting Soviet propaganda, to becoming a woke propaganda operation of its own that actively undermines the pillars of western civilization. . . .Everywhere you look in the USAID database, you see projects promoting LGBTQ ideology, mass immigration, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change-ism, and the like. You see programs that undermine the traditional family, that enable anti-free speech censorship, that strive to make the rest of the world just like urban liberal enclaves in the U.S.” He cites some of the grants: “$70,000 for a ‘DEI musical’ in Ireland, $47,000 for a ‘transgender opera’ in Colombia, $32,000 for a ‘transgender comic book’ in Peru, and $1.5 million for an LGBT jobs program in Serbia.” (Go here for more.) In a bigger move, all federal workers were offered a buyout of eight months severance and benefits. If they don’t, they risk losing their jobs as part of a reduction in force. So far, some 60,000 have accepted, about 3% of the federal workforce, though the overall goal is to cut the number of employees by 5%-10%. One agency offering buyouts to its entire workforce is the CIA. Though most national security personnel were exempt from the cutbacks, the new CIA Director John Ratcliffe decided to apply it to his clandestine domain. Granted, that institution has been guilty of hugely consequential intelligence failures (e.g., Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan) and scandalous political interventions (e.g., the Russiagate scandal, the Hunter Biden laptop coverup). A house cleaning is certainly in order. But if some agents or their handlers decide to take early retirement from their dangerous work, can we risk losing our spy networks in places like China, Russia, and Iran? Shouldn’t the pruning, for the CIA and elsewhere, be more targeted? UPDATE: A federal judge has paused the buyouts.

Title: Meta to Lay Off 5% of Employees Starting Today, Initiating Performance-Based Terminations

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, will begin issuing layoff notices starting today. These job cuts, referred to as 'performance terminations,' will primarily target the lowest-performing 5% of employees. Unlike previous layoffs, Meta plans to keep its offices open on the day of the cuts and will not release a company-wide statement. #News Meta to lay off about 4,000 employees due to poor performance Social media giant #Meta will reportedly layoff 3,600 employees this year, according to recent filings.

Notifications will be sent to staff across over a dozen countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa between February 11 and February 18. ALSO SEE: Realme P3 Pro To Launch With Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 Chipset; AI-powered GT Boost Expected Meta had earlier confirmed plans to cut around 5% of its workforce, targeting "lowest performers," with some positions to be refilled. In a memo, these cuts were labeled as “performance terminations,” a term initially reported by The Information. Unlike prior company-wide layoffs, Meta will keep its offices open on Monday and will not provide additional details about the decisions, according to a memo from Janelle Gale, Meta’s Head of People. In a separate memo posted on Friday, Peng Fan, Meta’s VP of Engineering for Monetization, urged employees to support an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other "business-critical" engineering roles. This accelerated hiring initiative is set to run from February 11 to March 13. Meta decided to layoff 3,600 employees citing low-performance. On the surface, it is about efficiency. But, what’s the deeper narrative? - Is performance the issue or experience in a volatile tech climate? - Are companies losing sight of long-term impact in favor of short-term… pic.twitter.com/cTHscYUar7 — Vikas (@vikaspar_) February 8, 2025 The trend of job cuts extends beyond Meta, with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Stripe, and Robinhood also reducing their workforce in 2025. Google initiated a voluntary exit program in its U.S. Platforms and Devices team, affecting Android and Pixel. Microsoft focused on performance-based terminations, some without severance. Amazon cut 200 jobs in fashion and fitness divisions, realigning its North America Stores team. Stripe laid off 300 employees in product, engineering, and operations, despite plans to grow its workforce by 17% by year-end. Robinhood's media arm, Sherwood, also downsized as part of a restructuring.

Title: ‘It was intentional’: Dollar Tree shopper walks to Coca-Cola shelf. Then she notices a sign

Time Published: 2025-02-09T19:00:00Z

Stace Fernandez Coca-Cola is being boycotted as people accuse the soda giant of being racist and anti-immigrant. But are the claims true? Coca-Cola has branded itself as the drink that brings people together and puts a smile on your face. But people have begun to question the brand as rumors swirl about how they treat employees. In a viral video with more than 250,000 views, content creator Juju (@jujubluebear) shared something she noticed in a dollar store. As Juju walked the aisles of her local Dollar Tree, she immediately stopped and stared at the Coca-Cola display. On the shelf with the unrefrigerated drinks was a small sign that read, “Don’t forget the ICE.” It seems innocuous at first, but then it clicks that Juju thinks this is a reference not to literal ice but to ICE, aka Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Well, well, well, look what we have here. [Expletive] Coca-Cola. Don’t forget the ICE? Yeah, I [expletive] bet Coca-Cola. [Expletive] you,” Juju said. “U knew damn well what u were doing putting that sign right there,” Juju added in the caption. Part of why Juju implies that Coca-Cola and Dollar Tree are promoting ICE is because of a rumor that’s swirling about Coke laying off undocumented immigrants en masse and calling ICE on them. But it could also just be that the store is trying to upsell people to buy ice with their unrefrigerated drinks. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. (FYI, Coca-Cola did donate to Trump.) Coca-Cola was added to this list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. If there were, major news outlets would be picking up on this story. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. On deportations: “If Coca-Cola had thousands of undocumented employees, that would mean the company knowingly hired illegal workers — only to then snitch on itself by calling ICE?” Distractify stated. “It’s not just unlikely, it’s illogical.” “Love whoever put that sign, cus you know very da.mn well it was intentional to remind everyone!” a top comment read. “I work at dollar tree those ice signs been there as long as they sold ice bags . pan the video to the right where the Pepsi end cap is. same signs,” a person said. “Pepsi forever. [Expletive] Coca-Cola,” another wrote. The Daily Dot reached out to Juju for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Dollar Tree and Coca-Cola via email.

Title: The New Yorker magazine's first hundred years

Watch CBS News By Kelefa Sanneh February 9, 2025 / 9:48 AM EST / CBS News The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. "1978," he said. "I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came." Asked his title, Diones replied , "I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around." "An expert on both the people and the magazine?" "That's right." "You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?" "Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!" he laughed. The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting. One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. "We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff." The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. "All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work," Diones said. Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse. "At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley," said editor David Remnick. "Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery." Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society. In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, "It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque." I asked, "What did he have against Iowa?" "I don't know," Remnick laughed. "To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles …" The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. "We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque," Remnick said. "It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking." Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers – more than two dozen. So, what is a fact-checker? "Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be," McIntosh said. "Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out," I said. "I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us," McIntosh laughed. And everything gets checked – not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Matthews, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. "He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'" she recalled. "And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic." "But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny," I said. "Not pithy enough, no," said Matthews. "All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'" Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow. The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month. So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, "It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in." "Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?" "I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure," said Remnick. "Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?" "No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging." These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, "How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation – four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine." For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: "He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers." One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: "Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them." In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in. I said, "maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?" "That's right, and I'm in it now," laughed Diones. "And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it." For more info: Story produced by Mary Raffalli. Editor: George Pozderec.

Title: Meta to Begin Previously Announced Workforce Reduction

Meta is set to begin its previously announced workforce reduction on Monday (Feb. 10). The company told staff on Friday (Feb. 7) that those who are laid off will be cut off from Meta’s internal system within an hour and notified about their severance packages via email, The Information reported Friday. CNBC reported on Jan. 14 that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its “low performers,” as the move was described in internal messages from company executives, and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta has more than 72,000 employees. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one of the internal messages, per the report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce reportedly planned or made layoffs during the first weeks of 2025. It was reported Tuesday (Feb. 4) that Salesforce is eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company. On Jan. 29, it was reported that Amazon was laying off dozens of people in its communication department. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said the move aimed to “help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers.” Microsoft reportedly plans to pause hiring in part of its U.S. consulting business and said in January that it would lay off less than 1% of its workforce. The hiring pause is reportedly part of the Microsoft consulting division’s efforts to manage costs. As for Meta, it was reported Thursday (Feb. 6) the company could pull the plug on its metaverse efforts. Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of its metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Meta goes to war with leakers

A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. by Alex Heath During a Q&A with employees earlier this week, one of Meta’s top executives gave an ominous warning. After lamenting “a tremendous number of leaks” from inside the company, CTO Andrew Bosworth said that, while he didn’t want to “ruin the surprises,” the company was “making progress on catching people.” Since Mark Zuckerberg’s comments at a recent all-hands meeting were published, Meta’s leaders have tried to clamp down on an agitated and tense cohort of workers. The power struggle isn’t over. It’s unclear how Meta is going to look on the other side. “There’s a funny thing that’s happening with these leaks,” Bosworth said during his Q&A earlier this week (a recording of which I obtained). “When things leak, I think a lot of times people think, ‘Ah, okay, this is leaked, therefore it’ll put pressure on us to change things.’ The opposite is more likely.” “This is a company that, from Mark’s inception, as far as I can tell, has always played the repeat game,” he said. “And if you create an environment where leaks cause people to make things change internally, then it creates more leaks. You create an incentive structure that’s wrong… I think that’s a thing that we should change. I think we probably will at some point but I don’t know when that’s going to be.” Like any company with tens of thousands of employees, Meta is not a monolith. There are still true believers and those who also do their best to just tune out the drama. But there are also reasons for concern: Employees are on edge about Zuckerberg’s next round of “low-performer” layoffs that are arriving on Monday. And many are still reeling from his politically-charged changes to content moderation and DEI programs. The disconnect between that group of concerned employees and upper management was on full display during Bosworth’s Q&A earlier this week. At one point, he responded to a question from a female employee on Zuckerberg’s widely-circulated comment to Joe Rogan about wanting more “masculine energy” in the workplace. The employee asked Bosworth to respond to Zuckerberg saying that companies need “less feminine energy.” Zuckerberg never technically said that in the interview with Rogan, though one could easily interpret the “masculine energy” soundbite to mean that the CEO wants a more specific kind of energy at the expense of the other. Bosworth went off. “This really bothered me because it’s evident from your question that you did not actually listen to the thing you are criticizing or asking questions about. And that is not acceptable. I don’t know why people think it’s an okay thing to take something laundered through a biased source construct and bring it here without even bothering to look at anything that is free and online.” “He wants us to be a place that supports all people,” he continued. “He says that in the interview and then you come in here and you haven’t even bothered to listen to the thing. It’s like three minutes. It wouldn’t take you that long. So, you can tell from your question [that] you didn’t even read it. You didn’t even listen to it. You just read something online and got real mad about it. You’ve been mad about it for weeks, obviously. For weeks, you’ve been mad about it. It’s crazy.” Some noteworthy job changes in the tech world: If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line, all of our reporting, and an improved ad experience on the web.

Title: The Apple AirPods 4 hit an all-time low of $100, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=176151499
Time Published: 2025-02-07T17:12:11Z
Full Content:
The latest edition of our weekly deal roundup includes a range of discounts on Apple's AirPods. The standard AirPods 4 are down to $100, which ties their lowest price to date, while ANC version of those earbuds and the higher-end AirPods Pro 2 are cheaper than usual at $149 and $169, respectively. If you don't need new headphones, we're also seeing discounts on Peacock and Apple Music subscriptions, our favorite robot vacuum and microSD card for those on a budget, Sonos speakers and more. Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today. Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 at Amazon ($80 off MSRP) : If you're willing to pay extra and don't mind a traditional in-ear design, the AirPods Pro 2 are still the best wireless earphones Apple makes and our favorite pair for iPhone owners overall. They have the same set of Apple-friendly features noted above, but add stronger ANC, a more secure fit, fuller sound (thanks to that in-ear design), an hour or two of extra battery life and onboard volume controls. As of last fall, they can also function as an FDA-approved hearing aid. That said, if you aren't tethered to the Apple ecosystem, there are other pairs with superior noise cancellation, battery life and audio quality out there. This discount is $15 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday, but it's a good $20 to $30 below the pair's typical street price and $80 less than buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. Peacock Premium (1-year) for $30 at Peacock ($50 off, new and returning users only) : New and returning subscribers can grab a year of Peacock's ad-supported plan for $30 through Feburary 18. (Yes, it's called "Premium" even though it has ads.) If you're not a current subscriber and don't see the discount, use the code WINTERSAVINGS at checkout. NBCUniversal ran a similar offer around Black Friday that dropped the subscription to $20, but this is still $50 off the annual plan's usual price. While we wouldn't call Peacock essential, it should be worth checking out if you're big into Premier League soccer, WWE live events or most shows from NBC and Bravo — The Office and Law and Order included. Samsung Evo Select (1TB) microSD card for $70 at Amazon ($10 off) : The Evo Select is the budget pick in our guide to the best microSD cards: It's certainly not the fastest model we've tested, but it's quick enough if you just want to boost the storage of a Nintendo Switch or Android tablet on the cheap without feeling totally bogged down. Just don't expect it to be all that great for large file transfers. This deal matches the all-time low for the extra-spacious 1TB model. Also at Samsung and B&H. Sonos Era 100 for $199 at Sonos ($50 off) : To address the elephant in the room, no, Sonos is not doing well right now. A redesign of the company's control app last May has been a colossal failure, eventually leading to the departure of the audio brand's CEO and chief product officer last month and sizable layoffs just this week. It's hard to get jazzed about discounts with all of that in mind, but this is a deal roundup, and we still do recommend much of firm's audio gear in our various buying guides, so we're obligated to mention that the company is still running a sale on its soundbars and home speakers through February 9. One highlight is the Sonos Era 100 for $199, a $50 discount that ties the lowest price we've seen. This is the top midrange pick in our guide to the best smart speakers: While the software situation is still iffy, the hardware still delivers impressively clean and balanced sound for its size. If you just want a single speaker for enjoying music at home, it remains a decent value at less than $200. Also at Amazon, Walmart, B&H and others. $100 Apple Gift Card + $10 Best Buy Gift Card for $100 at Best Buy ($10 off) : If you buy a $100 Apple gift card at Best Buy, the retailer will throw in a bonus $10 gift card to its own store for no extra cost. Both cards will be emailed to you digitally. For the unfamiliar, you can apply an Apple gift card to just about anything Apple makes, be it a new iPhone, an Apple TV+ subscription or purchases on the App Store. If you're looking to grab something along those lines and know you'll shop at Best Buy again anyway, it's hard to complain about a bit of bonus money. Apple Music (6-month) for $3 at Apple ($52 off, new subscribers and select devices only) : Speaking of Apple services, the company is running a promotion that doles out six months of Apple Music for $3 total. Normally, a solo subscription costs $11 per month after a 30-day free trial, or a three-month trial if you've recently bought an Apple device. This newest promo comes with a few caveats, though: You must be new to Apple Music, not eligible for the aforementioned three-month trial and able to redeem the offer through an iPhone, iPad or Mac. If you meet all of that criteria, however, this is a nice way to get a half-year of music streaming for cheap. We praise Apple Music in our guide to the best music streaming services for its lossless streaming quality, ease of use with Apple devices and emphasis on letting actual people introduce you to new music. Apple says this deal will run through February 27. Just be aware that your subscription will be set to auto-renew until you cancel. iRobot Roomba Vac Essential (Q0120) for $130 at Amazon ($120 off) : The Roomba Vac Essential is the top pick in our guide to the best budget robot vacuums. It's a basic entry-level model, as it navigates semi-randomly instead of mapping set paths and will still bonk into furniture every now and then. But it cleans well enough, especially on hard floors, and we've found it easy to set up and control through Roomba's mobile app. If you're on a budget and live in a smaller place that isn't inundated with pet hair, you could do much worse. This discount is the lowest price we've tracked and a $20 drop from the robovac's typical going rate in recent months. Also at Best Buy, Target and others. Anker 713 USB-C Charger for $20 at Amazon ($20 off) : The Anker 713 Charger is a compact wall charger with one USB-C port that can deliver up to 45W of power. It's not the newest or fastest model out there, but it's easy to tuck in a bag and powerful enough to charge many modern smartphones and tablets at full speed. This discount matches the lowest price we've seen and takes about $8 off the device's common street price. Also at Anker. If you need something faster with a couple more ports, the 67W Anker Prime charger is also on sale for a low of $36. Razer Viper V3 Pro for $145 at Amazon ($15 off) : It's not a massive discount, but this $15 drop marks the lowest price we've seen for the Viper V3 Pro, which tops our guide to the best gaming mice. This is very much a niche device, aimed squarely at those who take competitive PC games seriously, but its 54-gram design is super lightweight, consistently responsive and comfortable for a wide range of grip types and hand sizes. Just don't expect it to keep you from getting owned in Counter-Strike 2 or Marvel Rivals on its own. Also at Best Buy. LG B4 OLED TV (48") for $600 at Best Buy ($200 off) : This ties the lowest price we've seen for the 48-inch LG B4, which is the entry-level model in LG's 2024 OLED lineup. While it's not as bright or color-rich as some higher-end alternatives, it still offers the essential perks of any good OLED TV: superb contrast with deep black tones, clear motion, wide viewing angles and the like. It's also a nice value for gaming, as it has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support refresh rates up to 120Hz. It's just better off in a darker room, and this particular model is relatively small. If you're curious about what other TV deals are available ahead of the Super Bowl, note that we have a separate roundup just for those.

By David Snow • 8:01 am, February 7, 2025 Sonos has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons, but that doesn’t mean its audio gear isn’t great. Sonos Ace headphones made a big splash when they came out as an AirPods Max rival, and right now you can grab Ace headphones for $100 off on Amazon. That’s a great deal on great cans. Sonos has long built a good reputation among Apple fans for great audio gear. That reputation took a hit when Sonos released a faulty app, alienating customers. And troubles have cascaded, with a CEO departure and layoffs. It just came out that Sonos ditched plans to build a MagSafe iPhone speaker. But generally, the gear is still excellent. And that includes the company’s first over-ear wireless active noise-canceling (ANC) headphones, Sonos Ace, released in May 2024. While competitor AirPods Max lists for $549 and rarely goes under $450, you can now get $449 Sonos Ace for $349, or 22% off. Sonos said the new cans were its most-requested product in the company’s history. Customers probably knew the company would get the cans right, and by all reports, it did. And if you already dabble in Sonos audio, say, with a home-theater sound system, all the better. Sonos Ace works brilliantly with other Sonos gear. The Amazon deal is marked “limited-time,” so don’t dawdle. Hate to have that price shoot back up before you get there.

Title: As Trump and Musk scramble everything, investors cool on enterprise tech’s prospects

UPDATED 10:56 EST / FEBRUARY 07 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof President Trump’s chaos and Elon Musk’s mischief with his dubious DOGE coup squad continued unabated, with far too many bizarre, racist and probably illegal actions to list here, not to mention rampant conflicts of interest and security and privacy violations. It’s affecting pretty much all of us, including enterprise and tech companies. With all the lawsuits filed to stop them, it’s going to be an unpredictable mess for a long time to come, and we know how much businesses and investors love uncertainty. Back in the normal world, such as it is, OpenAI keeps scrambling to respond to DeepSeek with new services and an admission by CEO Sam Altman that the company so far has missed the open-source boat. It’s not certain a bill to ban DeepSeek’s use in the U.S. will make a difference. And other cheap models are arriving fast. None of this, however, is discouraging investors from continuing to plow big bucks into OpenAI, and others such as former OpenAI exec Ilya Sutskever’s startup SSI. It was a week of disappointing earnings at several big enterprise tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon and chipmakers AMD, Arm and Qualcomm, as investors squinted to find enough AI upside to justify high capital spending — which most definitely is not easing despite the DeepSeek shock — and high stock prices. That said, some firms such as Palantir and NXP showed enough upside to please investors. And in cyber, Cloudflare and Fortinet both saw their shares rise on quarterly beats. In 2025 predictions from theCUBE Research analysts, generative AI remains the big theme, in everything from networking and software development to cybersecurity and consumer services. After attending IBM’s first Analyst Day in years, John Furrier contends it’s showing how IBM can help lead in the new AI era where open source could rule. The explosion of gen AI-mediated data will require a return to the skills of reference librarians — or what dbInsight’s Tony Baer calls knowledge engineers. Layoffs are on the rise at Salesforce, Workday, Hugging Face, Okta, GM’s Cruise, Sprinkler, Sonos and beyond, in part thanks to AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says he’s hiring 2,000 salesforce for Agentforce but AI will make more near-term engineer hires unnecessary. SailPoint has another initial public offering coming, raising perennial speculation that the IPO market may have an opening in 2025. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, now out on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, which looks at the prospects for cloud providers, which still look promising despite disappointing earnings recently. Here’s all the news from this week: Data in the generative AI era: We need more knowledge engineers IBM’s open-source playbook: The AI market shift, DeepSeek’s lessons and the future of AI development US lawmakers introduce bill to ban DeepSeek on federal devices The EU is now enforcing the AI Act, banning high-risk AI systems Google quietly changes stance on using AI for weapons or surveillance Former FTC chief Lina Khan thinks we should stop worshiping the tech giants. I didn’t always agree with her assessment of what’s a monopoly or what the fixes should be, and still don’t agree with her basic argument here that a lack of competition made DeepSeek’s recent breakthrough possible. That said, in the larger picture — which includes the considerable damage to democracy by some of these companies the last few years, the concentration of wealth that allows the likes of Elon Musk to invade and destroy governmental entities unilaterally and self-servingly, and the eagerness of most Big Tech companies to knuckle under to a manifestly incompetent president who is making even more a mess of everything this time around, including blatantly racist actions — well, I have to say we should have been listening to her and others who said the power of Big Tech and its leaders is too concentrated for anyone’s good, because it’s now more than apparent. OpenAI’s ChatGPT can now perform comprehensive research for its users OpenAI seems to be scrambling, as CEO Sam Altman admitted the company was on the “wrong side of history” when it comes to open-source AI. And DeepSeek isn’t the only low-cost challenge: New LLM developed for under $50 outperforms OpenAI’s o1-preview Google expands access to Gemini 2.0 AI models and debuts experimental versions Mistral adds major updates to its AI assistant, mobile apps and high-speed responses Report: Amazon tipped to ship revamped Alexa AI updates later this month DOGE reportedly seeking to develop ‘GSAi’ government chatbot Lightning AI moves into the AI marketplace with ready-made enterprise applications Oracle boosts generative AI feature in its human capital management cloud application Dynatrace debuts new AI, security features for its observability platform Adobe’s Acrobat AI Assistant digs into contracts to help users understand what they’re agreeing to Alluxio boosts performance for AI model training Aerospike says it has achieved a milestone in NoSQL OLTP performance Pipedrive introduces agentic AI teammates for the sales process Presidio launches Private AI Accelerator powered by Nvidia for secure on-premises AI Ilya Sutskever’s SSI reportedly raising new funding at $20B+ valuation Softbank set to invest $40 billion in OpenAI at $260 billion valuation, sources say OK, so it’s a little higher valuation, but wasn’t this reported last week?

Even Facebook abandoned “move fast and break things” many years ago (though it might be coming back in the form of “masculine energy”), and now we’re supposed to think this philosophy works for government? TL;DR: It doesn’t. And didn’t anyone vet these people? Apparently not. Seriously, apparently not! Makes you wonder what else was missed that could endanger national security. One of Elon Musk’s key DOGE team members, Marko Elez, quits after being outed as a racist And what a surprise, he’s getting hired back now! And now a Treasury threat intelligence team is recommending that DOGE members be monitored as an “insider threat.” How bad does this have to get before we take it seriously? Hey Tim Cook, how’s that $1 million inauguration donation and bended knees working out for you? Apple shares fall after China ponders mounting probe into App Store Gee, I wonder who got Trump to concede here? Ontario cancels and un-cancels Starlink contract after tariffs concession But China still came back pretty hard with its own tariffs and Big Tech probes, as Apple and Intel just found out.

Onetime OpenAI co-founder John Schulman is leaving Anthropic after only five months to join former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati’s stealth AI startup (per Fortune). Michael Hurlston left as CEO of Synaptics, which makes chips for touchpads and related devices, to become CEO of optical component maker Lumentum Holdings.

Plus: Billionaire Kansas City Chiefs Owner Clark Hunt On Building A Dynasty — On And Off The Field After Amazon backed a startup developing new nuclear technology, other investors took notice. X-energy hopes to commercialize a type of small modular reactor, and on Thursday said it raised an additional $200 million from big names like the venture fund of billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs, following a $500 million funding round led by Amazon. The company, controlled by space-focused billionaire Kam Ghaffarian, says it now has enough money to get regulatory approval for its reactor design and build the first one. Developers of small modular reactors say they will be safer, and also faster and cheaper to build, but so far those promises haven’t come to fruition. Protestors rally against Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency," or DOGE, at Department of Labor in Washington, DC, on Feb.y 5, 2025. Billionaire Elon Musk and his young DOGE minions set off alarm bells this week as they accessed sensitive government databases and payment systems to cut federal spending. But the biggest potential conflict of interest isn’t Musk benefitting his companies directly—it’s his deep ties to China. Tesla and Musk enjoy a particularly cozy relationship with China’s Communist Party leaders, and the country was the only growing market for Tesla last year as sales in the U.S. and Europe slumped. The Senate confirmed one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial nominees, Russell Vought, as director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Project 2025 co-author is expected to expand the agency’s power and exert outsized control over government spending. Vought is one of several contributors to the far-right policy agenda who have now been elevated to major roles in Trump’s White House. FRANCOIS GUILLOT/AFP via Getty Images Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the L’Oréal cosmetics fortune and Europe’s richest woman, will retire from her role on the company’s board and give her vice chairmanship to her son, Jean-Victor Meyers. Bettencourt Meyers, worth an estimated $76.1 billion, is the granddaughter of the founder of the L’Oréal cosmetics company, and is the president of her family’s philanthropic foundation. Two divorces and a lifetime of impulsive behavior are both culprits in tamping down the fortune of former Fox News host and newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Forbes estimates that Hegseth and his wife Jennifer are worth about $3 million, but two-thirds of that fortune are his wife’s assets. A bipartisan bill introduced in the House would ban Chinese AI startup DeepSeek from government-owned devices after a report linked the AI chatbot to a Chinese state-run telecommunications company, sparking national security concerns. A cybersecurity analysis firm told the Associated Press that DeepSeek has hidden code that could send user login information to China Mobile, which the U.S. has banned from operating in the U.S. Getty Images Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the Justice Department to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” private companies and universities with “illegal” DEI programs shortly after she was sworn in Wednesday, the Trump Administration’s latest attack on DEI. Bondi told the Justice Department to enforce federal civil rights laws to urge private companies to abandon the policies, though she did not specify which civil rights legislation to use. Lawmakers are intensifying scrutiny over allegations that U.S. regulators pressured banks to sever ties with certain groups and sectors, primarily cryptocurrency firms, under the Biden Administration. In Wednesday’s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, several crypto executives said they were unfairly targeted under what many in the industry have labeled “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” The NCAA announced Thursday it will limit competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth, complying with an order made by President Donald Trump barring transgender women and girls from participating in women’s sports. The NCAA has over 530,000 student-athletes, fewer than 10 of whom are transgender, according to a statement NCAA president Charlie Baker provided to a Senate panel in December. More than 4,000 flights were delayed on Thursday afternoon while a winter ice storm moved from the Great Lakes to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The New York City area’s three airports, Philadelphia International, Boston Logan, and Washington D.C.’s Reagan National and Dulles all reported double-digit flight cancellations. The Trump Administration offered more than 2 million full-time federal workers the option to resign from their positions and receive eight months’ severance, but the IRS confirmed Thursday that specific, critical filing season positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program offer until May 15. The program, combined with an earlier hiring freeze, raised questions about whether the IRS would be sufficiently staffed for tax filing season. Now, it seems, the answer was no. ORLIN WAGNER/ASSOCIATED PRESS TOPLINE Kansas City Chiefs’ CEO and chairman Clark Hunt was born into a dynasty. The Dallas Texans, founded by his father Lamar, won an American Football League championship just before he arrived on the scene and then, after they became the Kansas City Chiefs, played in the first Super Bowl. Three years later, Hunt got to watch legendary quarterback Len Dawson lead the team to a title in a landmark game that immediately preceded the AFL-NFL merger. With a Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers in 2020, Kansas City began a run that ranks among the most dominant in sports history. Sunday’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles will be the Chiefs’ fifth appearance in the title game in six years, and a victory would give the team its fourth championship ring in that span, as well as the first Super Bowl three-peat ever. Hunt’s father coined the term “Super Bowl,” and his name graces the trophy given to the conference champion, hoisted again and again by Kansas City. The family, meanwhile, has now retained control of the Chiefs for the franchise’s entire 65-year existence—something of a rarity in professional sports. Today, the Chiefs are worth $4.85 billion, according to Forbes’ most recent NFL valuations. That leaves them a modest 24th in the league but still No. 39 among all sports teams worldwide, and it has made Clark Hunt and his three siblings—Lamar Jr., Sharron and Daniel—quite wealthy. They are all believed to have 25% stakes in the Chiefs, as well as shares of MLS’s FC Dallas and a small piece of the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, and Forbes estimates their fortunes at $1.6 billion each. WHY IT MATTERS Even as Hunt’s sports empire grows, though, he wants it to stay a family business, and preparing the next generation is something he discusses with his siblings “quite a bit.” “Honoring [my dad’s] legacy is very, very important to us, and we have no plans to disengage from the sports business,” he says. “It’s central to who we are as a family.” MORE Meet The Billionaire Owner Of The Philadelphia Eagles A judge temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s buyout offer to federal employees from taking effect Thursday, pushing back the deadline to at least Monday. Trump is reportedly planning mass layoffs among those who don’t take the resignation offer, per CNN: 2.3 million: The number of employees eligible for the buyout offer Roughly 2%: The share of workers offered the deal who have accepted so far, or about 40,000 employees 5% to 10%: The share of the federal workforce the White House wants to slash through the buyouts Just like you would when leaving any job, when you’re retiring, it’s important to spell out key details in a resignation letter. Decide what you want your transition to look like, and understand that the amount of notice you should give varies based on your industry, tenure and level at the company. Still, have a verbal conversation with your manager before going to HR, and only announce your retirement when you’re ready to leave, especially if you think your manager (or other decision-makers) may ask for an early end date.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another forecast miss from a U.S. megacap combines with caution ahead of January's employment report to keep a lid on stocks into Friday's open - with buoyant long-dated Treasuries squashing the yield curve to its flattest for the year. Much like Microsoft and Alphabet over the past couple of weeks, Amazon disappointed Wall Street late Thursday as concern about cloud computing doused revenue and profit forecasts and sent its stock down 4% overnight. The latest underwhelming outlook from the "Magnificent 7" top U.S. tech firms reins in an otherwise upbeat S&P500, with questions about heavy spends on artificial intelligence piqued again by the development of China's cheap DeepSeek model. The DeepSeek buzz, by contrast, continues to fire up Chinese stocks. They added another 1%-plus earlier on Friday despite ongoing concerns about a mounting Sino-U.S. trade war and Monday's deadline for Beijing's retaliatory tariffs. But the day's macro events will likely take precedence, with the release of the January U.S. employment report and long-term revisions of past job creation. Job growth likely slowed to 170,000 in January from just over quarter of million the prior month, partly restrained by wild fires in California and cold weather across much of the country. Those distortions add a further complication to the readout, which will include annual benchmark revisions, new population weights and updates to the seasonal adjustments. The week's sweep of other labor market reports, however, do point to some cooling of conditions - with job openings falling, layoffs rising and weekly jobless claims ticking higher. With the Federal Reserve already trying to parse the impact of President Donald Trump's new economic policies, payroll distortions just cloud the picture even further. And as Fed officials insist they can wait and see for a bit, Fed futures remain trained on two more interest rate cuts this year - resuming about midyear. The Treasury market is more encouraged though - sustaining the early week's sharp drop in 10-year yields into today's jobs report and seeing the 2-to-10 year yield curve compress to the flattest it's been in six weeks. Helping the long end this week has been reassuring signals from the Treasury's quarterly refunding report that a "terming out" of debt auctions to longer maturities is not yet in the works, as many had feared. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also insisted the new government's focus would be on getting long-term rates down rather than pressuring the Fed to ease prematurely. Reuters analysis shows Trump has placed holds on tens of billions of dollars in congressionally-approved spending for projects across the U.S. that range from Iowa soybean farmers adopting greener practices to a Virginia railway expansion. Bessent also doubled down on his view the administration wants to retain a "strong dollar" policy. But he colored that with a sideswipe. "What we don’t want is other countries to weaken their currencies, to manipulate their trade." But with the Fed on hold, central banks around the world continued easing interest rates apace this week - partly on concerns a trade tariff war will weaken their economies. With a sharp cut in its UK growth forecast, the Bank of England cut its policy rate by a quarter point on Thursday - with two of its policymakers voting for a bigger half point reduction. Sterling weakened initially, but has steadied since. Mexico's central bank also cut its interest rate by 50 basis points on Thursday - saying it could cut by a similar magnitude in the future as inflation cools and after the economy contracted slightly late last year. The European Central Bank, meantime, is expected to release its updated estimate of what it sees as a "neutral" interest rate later on Friday. That's important as it informs the ECB debate about whether it needs to cut rates below what considers neutral to revive the flagging euro zone economy. It's currently seen around 2% - 75bps below the standing policy rate. In thrall to the payrolls release, the dollar index was steady on Friday. Dollar/yen briefly notched a new low for the year, however, as Bank of Japan tightening speculation simmers. In Europe, stocks stalled near record highs as the heavy earnings season there unfolded. Banks there have a been a standout winner this week and again on Friday. Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest lender, was up 7.1% after it posted record annual profits and launch a new share buyback programme. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January employment report, University of Michigan February consumer survey, December consumer credit; Canada Jan employment report; Mexico Jan inflation * European Central Bank updates its estimate of "R*" neutral interest rate * Federal Reserve Board Governors Michelle Bowman and Adriana Kugler speak; Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks * U.S. corporate earnings: Cboe Global Markets, Fortive, Kimco Realty * Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba visits United States (By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Apple Kills AR Glasses, Hello Alexa AI, Reality Labs’ Reality, More Cinematic AI

Apple reportedly stops developing AR smart glasses. It will continue to support its $3500 Vision Pro, introduced just a year ago. Apple is banking on Vision Pro gaining traction with enterprises, having apparently forgotten the sad fate of Microsoft’s HoloLens. Having fallen grievously behind on AI with its shockingly lame once and future agent, Siri, Apple continues to spend billions on exactly the wrong things, forfeiting the wearable AI market to Meta, and betting on enterprise MR. Don’t sell your Apple stock yet, though. The great thing about being the biggest tech company in the world, with a market cap of $3.55 Billion, is that when Siri is finally the cheerful and useful assistant promised in 2012, it will kick every other AI off of the iPhone and we will spend all our waking hours with it inside the Apple ecosystem. An attendee wears the Amazon Echo Frames smart glasses with Alexa during the Consumer Electronics ... [+] Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 7, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Hello, Siri. It’s me, Alexa. With OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Grok sucking the AI air out of the room, it’s easy to forget about Amazon’s multibillion dollar investment in Anthropic. Now Amazon is preparing to launch an AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant, Alexa, marking its most significant enhancement in over a decade. The new Alexa engages in multi-turn dialogues, remembers user preferences, and can work autonomously as your agent. Amazon’s seemingly forgotten ‘Alexa everywhere’ strategy has new relevance as AI agents begin to infiltrate our daily lives. The service will initially be free for Prime members, but Amazon hopes to eventually charge $5 to $10 per month. An event is scheduled for February 26 to showcase the new features. To its credit, Meta seems to finally grok that Mixed Reality has become a mixed reality for them. Their one bright spot, the AI-enabled Meta Ray Ban audio smart glasses, ate $100 M in marketing on its way to Super Bowl Sunday. They sold a million Ray Bans in Q4. If so, it cost Meta $100 in marketing dollars per unit sold. This is the success story. It should be no surprise, therefore, that in a supposedly ‘leaked’ email sent to Reality Labs employees by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, 2025 is a “make or break year” for the division. That sounds a lot like “the year of efficiency,” which saw mass layoffs at the company. He singled out Meta’s disastrous metaverse venture, Horizon, which has evolved into a weak Roblox competitor. Their AR/VR Reality Labs division earned a record $1 B revenue Q4, but it still lost $4.4 B that same quarter. Reality Labs’ total losses for the last 12-month period are $17.7 B. Even though Meta has invested nearly one hundred billion dollars (not a typo) in their misguided metaverse, they could, and maybe should, walk away. $100 B is just 5.7% of Meta’s $1.76 trillion market cap today. The stock would probably go up on the announcement. Search bar on yellow background. Vector illustration Google is offering "voluntary" buyouts to hardware and platform employees ahead of expected cuts. The "Platform and Devices" unit includes more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest, according to internal documents we viewed. The buyouts are a signal of expected cuts within Google as it continues prioritizing, and utilizing, artificial intelligence. A skilled software developer, augmented with AI, can do the work of two or three people. If AI hasn’t made you a better, more productive coder, a voluntary buyout might be attractive. Olas home page. Olas, also known as Autonolas DAO, has secured $13.8 million in funding to launch Pearl, a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace for artificial intelligence agents. 1kx led the new funding round, with participation from Tioga Capital, Sigil Fund, Zee Prime Capital, and Spaceship DAO. Founded in 2021, Olas develops autonomous AI agents—software capable of performing tasks and making decisions with minimal human intervention in social media management and cryptocurrency trading. Olas also introduced an accelerator program offering up to $1 million in grants to developers for integrating new agents into the Pearl platform. Riffusion, a San Francisco-based AI startup, has launched a free web platform enabling users to create original music using their AI model, Fuzz. Fuzz generates complete songs from text descriptions, audio clips, or visual prompts and learns individual users’ musical preferences over time. This release comes as major tech companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok explore similar AI-driven audio synthesis technologies. Notably, artists like Alex Pall and Drew Taggart (The Chainsmokers) serve as advisors for Riffusion, highlighting the platform's potential in the music industry. Riffusion's approach positions AI as a collaborative tool for both professional musicians and casual enthusiasts, offering an intuitive interface without subscription fees. Riffusion, an AI-driven music generation startup, secured $4 million in seed funding on October 17, 2023. Greycroft led the investment round, with participation from South Park Commons and Sky9 Capital. The company plans to use the funds to enhance its AI capabilities, expand its music library, and improve user experience. Zynga has launched "The Dragon Egg Hunt," a global treasure hunt within its puzzle RPG, Game of Thrones: Legends, powered by Google Maps. Participants navigate a 2D map inspired by the show's opening credits, utilizing Google's Photorealistic 3D Tiles to search for virtual dragon eggs at key locations worldwide. The event offers surprises like incentivized codes and in-game rewards. Players collectively work to unlock milestone rewards and can win prizes, including a Google Pixel 9 Pro and Google Play gift cards. Sweepstakes run until February 24, 2025. Cinematic AI OpenAI’s Sora Filmmaking Tool Meets Resistance in Hollywood. Bloomberg reports the studios and OpenAI have not settled on a deal framework that would work for both sides financially and address concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, which was an impotant issue in two labor strikes that paralyzed Hollywood in 2023. Diretors who have worked with Sora say it’s difficult to control, and far from ready for a commercial role. Naturally, the creator of this exceptional music video for exiled Turkish rapper Ezhel, Öner S. Biberkökü, is a director. He made the film by himself in six weeks. It cost $2,800 in AI generation fees. “Using the possibilities of AI,” Biberkökü said in an email, “I created an official music video for Ezhel from the country he deeply misses—without ever meeting him in person. He loved the video and it became his official music video.” Sebastian Ungrad, an art director at Munich’s Storybook Studios, a renowned AI production company, made “Recursion” while on vacation. “I read the incredible book, , by Blake Crouch and felt inspired to create a trailer for a TV series adaptation that doesn’t exist (yet)!

Music by: John Utah - Run for the Man, M83 - Solitude (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) Native Foreign partner Nick Cleverov directed this co-production with TCL studios, and was selected as a Finalist in Project Odyssey's Narrative Competition. “The story is based on an idea I had a long time ago about a future where artists paint human memories to make androids feel alive,” Cleverov wrote on Linkedin. About a dozen people worked on the project which was made with a mix of generative AI, voice talent, and a new post pipeline. “The gatekeeping that once made filmmaking an exclusive endeavor is eroding, allowing more creatives to explore their visions in a meaningful way,” he said.

Title: Disney Falls Further on Fortune’s Most Admired Companies List for 2025
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-falls-further-on-fortunes-most-admired-companies-list-for-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:54:12Z

The Walt Disney Company has seen its reputation fall further, with a drop on Fortune’s 2025 list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. This post takes a look at what changed, how Disney performed relative to the competition, along with our commentary about what this does–and does not–mean. For the 18th year running, Apple takes the #1 spot atop the list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. This is the 27th year of the list, which is created in partnership between Fortune and Korn Ferry. The World’s Most Admired Companies list highlights organizations most respected by their peers, with executives emphasizing financial stability, innovation, respected leadership, and expansion of global businesses. After Apple, the 2025 top five includes Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Berkshire Hathaway. Several of these companies have been on the Most Admired list for years, a testament to their reputational stability during volatile times both politically and culturally. Berkshire Hathaway, for example, has been atop its category for every single year of the survey’s 27-year existence. Otherwise, Fortune calls attention to the tumult and turmoil of the last year for many companies. Last year, it specifically drew attention to Disney’s drop, and the various reasons for that. This year, Fortune discusses how Ralph Lauren took the top spot in apparel for the first time since 2014, dethroning Nike, which had enjoyed 10 straight years at No. 1 but suffered in 2024 from a sharp revenue slump exacerbated by a dearth of new products. In a food service industry roiled by inflation, McDonald’s staged a huge comeback thanks to Grimace (my explanation, not Fortune’s) and thanks to the $5 Happy Meal (Fortune’s explanation), finishing first. That ended a 12-year reign at No. 1 for coffee giant Starbucks, whose growth has leveled off amid dissatisfaction among customers and employees alike. These survey results suggest that industry insiders believe both Nike and Starbucks would benefit from a reboot, just as they felt with Disney last year. Obviously, executives do not believe Disney did enough to burnish its business reputation…but it also didn’t inflict much new damage, either. Last year, Disney ranked #12 overall among the companies from across the globe on the All-Star list of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies, which was a fall of 6 places as compared to last year. For the 2025 list, the drop is last extreme–Disney is down one spot, to #13. Honestly, contrasted with the company’s poor performance on all of these lists over the last few years, this might be considered a small victory by some. Separately, Disney actually improved its position on the most admired media & entertainment companies list for 2025. Last year, it lost the #1 spot to Netflix and fell to #4. Disney had held the top spot for 20 consecutive years prior to last year. For 2025, Disney bounces back to claim the #3 spot among entertainment giants. The methodology for choosing the top-ranked companies within industries is different than that for choosing All-Stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the All-Star list, but is #1 on the media list. Methodology matters here as the “how” of this list is indicative of what it does (and doesn’t) reflect. Fortune’s annual list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” (WMAC) is a collaboration with Korn Ferry to survey corporate reputations. The process begins with the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with international companies with revenues of $10 billion or more. From there, the candidate pool is reduced to the highest-revenue companies in each industry. To determine the best-regarded companies in 52 industries, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors, and analysts to rate enterprises within their own industry on nine criteria, including investment value, quality of management, caliber of products, ability to attract talent, etc. To select the 50 All-Stars, Korn Ferry asks nearly 4,000 executives and insiders to select the 10 companies they admired most. They select from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry. The difference in the voting rolls explains why some results can seem at odds with each other. Here’s Fortune’s 2025 Top 20 All-Star List: Turning to commentary, Fortune’s WMAC list is fascinating. However, I also don’t think it’s as important as the similar Axios Harris Poll that typically comes out later in the spring. At least, not from the perspective of anyone here who, presumably, cares more about the guest experience and less about the corporate employee one. I’m really looking forward to the 2025 Axios-Harris list, and seeing whether less controversy (hopefully!) results in a higher ranking. It should be apparent in reading the methodology section for the Fortune WMAC list that the critical difference with this Fortune list is that it’s voted on by industry executives, directors, and analysts rather than the general public. Leaders within corporations prioritize different qualities or characteristics than do consumers. Metrics like investment value, quality of management, ability to attract talent, and social responsibility may not matter to the average American responding to such a survey. There are scenarios where “investment value” could be diametrically opposed to what consumers prize. Analysts might love Lightning Lane Premier Pass and the elimination of Disney’s Magical Express, thinking “that Chapek fella had some good ideas.” Just gonna go out on a limb and assume that would not be the consensus among consumers, though. Where there is overlap, it’s primarily with quality of the product and maybe of management, but the latter is arguably a bit too inside baseball for the average American. It matters to people who read sites like this one–around here, Bob Iger and Josh D’Amaro aren’t just household names, there are strong opinions about the dynamic duo. But I’d bet that around half of Axios Harris poll respondents recognize Bob Iger, and less than 5% know the name Josh D’Amaro. Never underestimate the knowledge gap between super-fans and regular people (can you name the CEOs of every company in the Fortune top 10?!) So really, it’s the products and public-facing experience that matters to you and I. The discrepancies between Fortune’s industry-specific and All-Star lists even hint at this. Within an industry, there’s more insight into the competition. Zoom out and ask all executives from the list, and there’s still more knowledge relative to the general public, but it’s still a bit of a smell test. They probably know about the proxy fight, performance of the stock, and whatever else they’ve read about Bob Iger in the WSJ (a lot of it has not been good). Point being, the ongoing layoffs and business restructurings and yet another proxy fights and succession struggles and stock underperformance and constant palace intrigue/ongoing Battle of the Bobs probably took their toll on Disney’s reputation in the business community. But then again, the executives’ kids likely liked Moana 2 and Inside Out 2, and that also counts for something–silly as it might sound. So how is the Fortune list relevant to you, as a fan of Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Frankly, it’s a lot less meaningful than the Axios Harris poll. (That’s the one I’m anxiously awaiting.) Companies can overperform on this list while offering awful consumer products and services. Or vice-versa. To be sure, there’s a lot of overlap between this list and the Axios Harris poll. But then there are companies like Berkshire Hathaway, which is beloved in the corporate world but more of an unknown among the general public. It has ranked highly every single year of the Fortune WMAC list; it didn’t make the cut at all–good or bad–on the Axios Harris poll. Other companies like Walmart, Fedex, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, American Express, and others rank very differently–or not at all–on the Axios Harris list. My expectation and hope is that the Walt Disney Company will actually see a healthy rebound on the Axios Harris list. Disgruntled theme park fans may not want to hear this, and point to unpopular decisions like replacing MuppetVision, razing the Rivers of America, poorly-received ride reimaginings, DAS changes, Lightning Lane Premier Pass, and so forth. But that stuff is unpopular with hardcore fans, not the general public. If it’s on their radar at all (and it mostly isn’t), the perception is probably very different. When I’ve explained to normie friends what’s happening, they’re more focused on the Monsters, Inc. Doors Coaster and Cars Land parts of the news. Much more importantly, Disney absolutely dominated the box office last year. Inside Out 2, Moana 2, and Deadpool & Wolverine were all huge hits. Other films performed really well and added to Disney’s box office haul, but I’m skeptical those movies (e.g. Alien Romulus) would register with the public as being “Disney,” and that’s what matters for the purpose of the survey. Streaming is probably the biggest wildcard…and also the biggest blind spot for me. Despite headlines about it shedding subscribers, Disney+ continues to grow in the United States (it’s losing them internationally). I don’t know whether this is just inertia and/or Bluey, or if people generally like Disney+ content. I see a lot of complaints about the Star Wars and Marvel shows on streaming, but I have no clue whether this is actually the public consensus, manufactured outrage, or a bit of both. Regardless, I’d still expect Disney to improve on the Axios-Harris poll. The last year has been largely controversy-free for the company, at least in terms of coverage you’d see on the nightly news. Disney vs. DeSantis is long-settled, the last proxy fight has been over for a while, and it’s been over a year since the dust-up between Bob Iger and Elon Musk. There are certainly assorted “controversies” within the fan community, but as far as the broader Disney-consuming public goes, I can’t really think of anything from the last ~365 days. It’s been a mostly positive year for Disney on balance, and given that, I suspect the box office results, strong guest satisfaction scores for the parks, and Disney+ domestic subscriber count will matter above all else in dictating Disney’s position on the Axios-Harris poll. But I suppose we shall see. Turning back to the Fortune WMAC list, this makes a difference from a guest-facing perspective in Disney’s ability to attract and retain talent, and the downstream effects of that. Disney has long been able to compete with corporate giants offering better compensation because of the name Disney and what that means. Talented professionals wanted to work for Imagineering because of the name cachet and being part of something cool and special. On a frontline level, one of the reasons the College Program has been so successful is because Disney is a powerful word on a résumé. Recruiters overlook the role and are more interested in the experience with the Walt Disney Company. Ask anyone who has worked for Disney at any level–they’ve almost certainly received more questions about Disney during subsequent job interviews than anything else. The consequence of Disney not being able to attract top talent would be a future with fewer Lanny Smootses or Joe Rohdes. Not being able to make the same strides in robotics, groundbreaking innovations that earn patents, or advancements in Audio Animatronics. And that’s just in Imagineering, one relatively small silo of Disney. The Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies list also matters a lot to Disney. If you look through the archives on the Walt Disney Company’s corporate website–the one that focuses on investor relations, careers, and the company’s impact–there used to be annual press releases touting its position on the Fortune WMAC list. The last one of those I could find, not-so-coincidentally, is 2023. The bottom line is that there’s a direct nexus between Disney’s corporate reputation among leaders in the business world and among fans. It certainly is not as immediate, but there are real world consequences for a company seeing its reputation falter. A drop from #12 to #13 certainly is not a five-alarm fire, but as a fan who wants Disney to attract the best and the brightest, it’s also not great that they’ve fallen from #6 to #13 in the span of two years, and are no longer #1 in the entertainment industry. Long-term, the consequence of this is that Disney could lose talent to Netflix, Amazon, Marriott, or even Comcast (we’ve already seen this happen with layoffs at Imagineering resulting in an influx of talent to Universal Creative–hopefully the same thing now happens in reverse with Epic Universe finished and WDI needing to staff up). For many Disney fans, being an Imagineer is the holy grail–but for a lot of actual job candidates, it’s one of many options. There are also other important positions in Burbank, Glendale, Central Florida and beyond that need to be able to attract top talent. They flocked to Disney in the past because it was a beloved American institution, with an unrivaled reputation. Let’s hope that reputation is restored in the years to come, among both the general public and corporate leaders. Need Disney trip planning tips and comprehensive advice?

What’s your take on Disney spot on the 2025 Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies list? Think the company can bounce back with a less tumultuous year? Think a clear succession plan, better stock performance, and another year removed from controversies will help? Hope Disney gets its groove back soon? Do you agree or disagree with our assessment? Any questions we can help you answer? Hearing your feedback—even when you disagree with us—is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! It’s good to see Disney has improved on the downward spiral over the past year. I’m optimistic about the future of the parks. Tom, I know you’re a Disney super fan, but part of what I admire about this blog is your willingness to admit Disney is far from perfect in a lot of ways. So with the guest experience still lacking (the ol’ “paying more for less” thing) amongst a lot of other issues, kind of curious why you’d be rooting for Disney to climb the ranks in the Axios-Harris list (or any other poll)? I’m not super knowledgeable in this department or anything – I’ve just become kind of fascinated with Disney as a business lately – but my thought is that maybe continued tumbling down the ranks in various polls would concern Disney leadership and perhaps motivate some positive change for guests and/or employees? I’m not sure how positive reinforcement for Disney’s current behavior really helps anyone? PS, my MIL sent me a photo of her 1993 receipt from MGM Studios today, and their family of four got in for a total of $103! My husband looked, and that would be $217 in today’s dollars. It’s costing our family of four nearly $600 for that in May 2025…that made me feel a certain kind of way… What I find strange is, in spite of all the cash-wringing practices Disney has enacted over the past four years, the stock price is still about half of what it was four years ago. With all rabid fan perspectives put completely aside, from a business perspective, the stock price matters. And cash-wringing isn’t just bad for guests and customers. It can result in huge losses like Disney experienced with their Galactic Star Cruiser debacle. (They still haven’t learned lessons from the initial roll out of California Adventure. When you promise the moon and deliver rocks, the bottom line suffers.) I’m not a business expert, but it seems pretty obvious to me Disney did too much overseas expansion too quickly. The company is overextended and cannot adequately maintain the infrastructure they have in place while simultaneously designing and building new attractions. It’s just bizarre to hear about billions of dollars in new “investment” while the parks have just so many burned out light bulbs, rides that constantly break down and a Disneyland Tomorrowland which isn’t much more than a ghost town. Okay, here’s the outlook for one fan who goes just once a year but spends enormously on that trip. 1) Taking the country out of Country Bears and making it all about IP makes me want to throw up. 2) Bulldozing Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island for a not (for me) nostalgic attraction is enough for me to never plan a future trip (after my early May trip.) 3) Eliminating Muppets Courtyard is a sacrilege to the memory of Jim Henson – destroying his last project?? That should be a National Historic Landmark? 4 Getting rid of Dinoland instead of putting Tropical Americas elsewhere is an insult to the funny and creative Imagineers who created this very cool homage to 1950’s American road culture. I’m going in May basically to meet the characters and have my last luscious Via Napoli pizza. I feel the exact opposite for every single one of your points. Thank you for not going to the parks again, one less person in line …however, I agree with every one of your points. Well stated! WMAC seems to apply more to the views of the Wall Street elite and executives in other companies who are on the outside looking in. I would be more interested in what the day-to-day employees think. A lot of those places are toxic places to work. I have friends who worked at Apple and simply quit due to the burnout and demands. I knew a couple of animators at Disney, who essentially said the same thing — that their talents went pretty much unappreciated. So I would not put much stock in what Wall Street or management says about “what” is to be admired in a company like Disney. It seems now to be a company of bean counters and profit centers. They want to squeeze every dollar they can out of the customer or out of the hides of the workers. CJ: “…dropped from 3rd most powerful person in Hollywood to 9th” Toby: “[Do they] still make the playoffs, or is the cutoff line…” CJ: “They take it seriously.” https://youtu.be/FsM_eeUyOBs?si=wHlNzqBE6s8fFV3I&t=78 Classic. Such sharp writing and dialogue. It’s been too long since we’ve had a good Aaron Sorkin show. Sports Night is one of my favorite shows to this day–and one of the most underrated of all time. Even if the people voting on the list are industry executives, directors, and analysts, I wouldn’t be surprised if the rankings reflected residual effects from Florida’s most recent culture war battle. As for the effects of this list on Imagineering candidates, my sources inside Imagineering don’t care about the list, as they are the biggest Disney fans around. Yes, a lot of people bounce around between Universal and Disney, depending on which one has active projects at any given time. Given the opportunity, however, to work at either Universal or Disney, most would pick Disney. Where Disney could have a problem is with future generations of Imagineers, but I doubt kids in middle and high school putting in extra hours studying math and science so they can be Imagineers someday care about the list. “As for the effects of this list on Imagineering candidates, my sources inside Imagineering don’t care about the list, as they are the biggest Disney fans around.” You only know who you know, though. Imagineering is definitely NOT just populated by Disney super fans–far from it. That’s more the case in Florida and internationally, but Glendale is a mix. WDI is a big organization itself, and I’d imagine there are some silos where it is more or less “acceptable” to be hardcore fans. (I also only know who I know!) That makes sense. Glendale pulls from a talent pool with more employment options than Orlando. I really have no comment about where Disney lies on this list, but looking at the top five, I haven’t yet stopped laughing. Apparently their criteria for “admiration ” isn’t mine! I could see quibbling with 4 of the top 5, but not Nvidia. If you’re not familiar with the company, it’s worth reading up on its CEO, Jensen Huang. Dude is basically the personification of the American dream. I feel similarly about Warren Buffett, but I guess I could see others not admiring Berkshire Hathaway. Love Disney, but recently sold all my DIS stock. Prices are soaring, but customer experience is not. I feel they should be expanding much bigger and faster with all their cash flow. They also need to stay very far away from politics and woke ideas. I agree that Disney has made a number of mistakes in recent years, but please explain to me what part of “charging more for less” is “woke”. The day can’t come soon enough when people stop using that word to describe anything they don’t personally like. Yes, Disney never used to have politics in their movies. Except for when they created the three Caballeros to counter nazi propaganda efforts in north america. Or when they took a stand against animal cruelty with 101 dalmatians or talked about women’s rights in Mary Poppins. Or income inequality in robin hood, or women’s autonomy and toxic masculinity in beauty and the beast, and women’s autonomy again in aladdin. Or fascism and environmentalism in the lion king, or racism and environmentalism in pocahontas, or racism, ableism, and religious hypocrisy in hunchback of notre dame. Or sexism in mulan, or colonialism in a bugs life. Ratatouille is about how anyone can be good at something it doesn’t matter where they come from from which is the exact discussion at the heart of the DEI conversation, wall-e is about environmentalism, princess and the frog tackles racial bias. Or all the zillions of gay allegories like frozen, little mermaid, and lilo and stitch where a misunderstood person leaves where they’re from and finds community, love and family by embracing what others condemn about them. Or racism and political fearmongering in zootopia Yes, other than all of that, Disney just started talking about “politics” recently. Aeryn, I think you forgot Donald Duck fighting the Nazis on the home front. I also forgot Tarzan! The whole movie is about different forms of masculinity, comparing paternal masculinity, industrious masculinity, toxic masculinity etc Clayton is literally killed by his own toxic masculinity What’s to admire about a company that continues to fill executive pockets while magic makers (cast members) live in their cars because they cannot afford to live where parks are located. Without doing a deep dive into the numbers, I would hazard a guess that almost all of the companies topping this list have similar c-suite to average worker pay disparities. We just know about Disney’s because we’re all fans of the company, so we pay attention to this stuff. But it’s hardly unique in that regard. The outliers are the companies with CEOs taking little pay and offering better competition to the frontline (of the companies here, Costco comes to mind). To your point, though, this is another reason why average Americans may not put much weight in this list. Then again, if that’s the primary criteria, you aren’t going to admire many companies.

Title: Bandai Namco reportedly lost over 100 staff in the last year

Following project cancellations. Bandai Namco has reportedly lost over a hundred staff in the last year. As reported by Automaton, according to the online database of Japan's Pension Service, the company's staff headcount dropped from 1294 on 1st April 2024 to 1177 on 4th February 2025 - a decrease of 117 people. It's unclear which projects these employees were working on, or whether they left the company voluntarily or not. The news follows a report from Bloomberg last year stating the company was cutting its Japanese workforce and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand. What's more, while staff had not been directly laid off, around 200 employees were sent to what's known as "oidashi beya" - rooms where staff are left without a project to work on, often used instead for job hunting. These rooms are utilised in Japan due to strict labour laws making layoffs difficult to enforce. At the time, Bandai Namco denied using these rooms. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily." Eurogamer has once again contacted Bandai Namco to confirm this latest loss of staff, but the company declined to comment. However, these numbers from Japan's Pension Service do appear to line up with Bloomberg's report. The Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled by Bandai Namco in August last year, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down last year. Several other projects have reportedly been cancelled or paused, including a project commissioned by Nintendo. Last month, the Bandai Namco-published Unknown 9 franchise was cancelled as the developer admitted it "didn't come near" expectations. Next for Bandai Namco will be the network test for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign later this month. The news also follows the bizarre LinkedIn update from Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada who, after posting he was looking for new job opportunities, claimed he just wants to "meet more people and expand my horizons in the future".

Title: From Quest To Horizon: How Meta's Shifting Priorities Are Affecting Developers

Time Published: 2025-02-06T00:00:02Z
Full Content:
With concerns about declining sales and discoverability, UploadVR spoke with nearly two dozen VR studios to discuss the current state of shipping VR games on Quest. It's become increasingly apparent since last year that things are not what they once were, despite Meta's lead in VR and AR seeming unassailable. Meta's Reality Labs division is reporting record revenues, and Quest 3S seems to be selling well. Yet for many developers making VR games, the mood has soured. Some developers are buoyed by revenue through subscription programs like the Quest+ gaming catalog, with every new Quest 3S headset including three months of Quest+. However, many others are now struggling to find sales and to support their teams long-term. UploadVR spoke to developers with concerns about declining sales to learn about the current state of VR game development on Meta's store. Quest 3S seemingly had a successful launch late last year, with pack-in title Batman: Arkham Shadow reaching over one million players. Reality Labs as a whole earned its highest ever quarterly revenue last quarter. But before his departure, Meta's original technical guide through VR John Carmack warned that “setting out to build the metaverse is not the best way to wind up with the Metaverse.” Carmack noted: A memo was recently leaked from Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth noting “Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance.” 2025, it is said then, will determine whether Meta's hardware and metaverse division is “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure”. The wider video games industry continues seeing layoffs despite the industry's market value reportedly reaching around $184.3 billion. Factors cited by some include overinvestment following the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing development costs. Hearing about newly affected studios ending projects or reducing team sizes feels like a weekly occurrence and, for some, Quest is no longer delivering some studios the same returns they've once seen. The pace of complaints from developers seemed to speed up after the Meta Horizon App's redesign back in July, with many citing the transition in their interviews as a sore spot. For some, the store is still profitable, with Eye of the Temple only recouping its development costs after being ported to Meta's headset, even as Gorilla Tag cleared more than $100 million. But for developers seeing declining sales, what exactly is going wrong? Many point to issues concerning discoverability, curation, Meta's increased focus on Horizon Worlds and the decision to merge App Lab with the main store as a tipping point for revenue decline. Most studios requested anonymity in their talks with UploadVR to protect their relationships with Meta, though Andrew Eiche at Owlchemy Labs, Kevin Walker at Middle Man Games, and Alex Nasanov at iTales VR agreed to go on the record. As part of our discussion, Eiche made clear his comments are solely on his and Owlchemy's behalf and do not represent Google, which owns the veteran studio. Most developers feel Horizon Worlds is getting increased attention at the expense of store apps, mentioning it when asked how they view Meta's general direction. Several suggested this approach indicates Meta is pushing a mobile approach aimed at younger audiences, trying to entice young players who have no wallets by prioritizing free-to-play content. They perceive Meta as promoting Horizon Worlds as the default experience for VR users rather than paid apps on the storefront. “This is not the direction I would have chosen,” Andrew Eiche said over a video call with UploadVR. “I think they made a video game console and they want a general computing device.” Notably, Dimensional Double Shift from Owlchemy released as a free multiplayer app on Meta's storefront after a string of paid releases. Technically, this content type isn't supported by Horizon Worlds, which still requires physical input of some kind. Multiple developers sent us pages of screenshots of search results featuring what look like Horizon Worlds clones of premium games competing with paid work, and sometimes winning in search rankings. “This is bad for us devs. It's bad for consumers,” states Kevin Walker. “And when they show free [Gorilla Tag] clones above paid apps, I don't see how it's even good for Meta.” Eiche and others praised the Quest Store for what it's delivered in the past, with multiple platinum releases clearing one million units. Others understand Meta's priorities, but the prevailing sentiment in our talks with developers is concern and frustration. Here's a series of selected direct quotes from the developers with paid releases on the Quest Store who wished to remain anonymous: Horizon Worlds and its free destinations competing for search, promotion, and time in VR is one aspect of paid store developer frustrations, but Meta also stopped curating content on the storefront more generally in 2024. Many studios criticized the lasting impact of Meta getting rid of App Lab last year, which arrived in two stages. Scott Albright, CEO for Combat Waffle Studios, previously told UploadVR last year that he wasn't a fan of App Lab being discontinued, and that sentiment's only grown. Many developers see the move to make the store “open” as being a good one overall because it lowers barriers to entry. One studio called it “an inevitable step” for any platform looking to grow, and a positive change. That same developer, however, suggested Meta “wasn’t ready to manage the vast amount of very unpolished content and the lack of a warning time.” “I believe that this has also shifted the type of content that gets visibility on the store now and, as a consequence, opened up its doors for developers with new approaches to VR game development and also new ways of monetization. This has caused legacy devs and publishers having to adapt to new times, which takes a while,” said another developer. Here's another set of direct quotations from developers on their issues with the changes around curation: Some studios consider the removal process was rushed, though others argue that App Lab wasn't really merged in. One team says Meta “removed the main store” and put everyone on App Lab. Eiche says they changed the store to be like Google Play or Apple's App Store, though he concedes there are arguments both ways with an open platform. In recent times, the Horizon Store's home page seems to have improved when searching on desktop or inside the headset. Though the mobile app still prioritizes mobile Horizon Worlds content when you load it up, with no means to adjust this, the desktop homepage begins by highlighting the most popular apps and top-selling that week. But it is not long before you reach the 'Browse All' category, where listed entries often have some variation on the words “Gorilla,” “Tag” or “monkey.” These often outrank Gorilla Tag itself due to inflated ratings from a small number of users. Many of those we spoke with view the Quest Store's current discoverability poorly, and worse than Steam. One developer likened it to entering a department store filled with cheap clothes during the holidays. One studio called being discovered their biggest issue next to funding, while another said navigating the store has become “unnecessarily difficult.” Another expressed frustrations that promised support over marketing and reaching the main store never materialized. Adding mixed reality labels on the developer dashboard side are still curated by Meta, yet other genres are not. Some genres in the developer settings aren’t reflected as filters on the actual store, which is causing some frustrations, while others don't show the full selection of games in a specific genre. Just how badly have developers been affected saleswise? The exact percentage naturally varies depending on who you ask, but some of those who aren't supported by a platform subscription program suggest revenue drop-offs for their games between 50 - 80% for 2024 compared to 2023. Sales impact was much more visible in the second half of 2024 for many. One studio explains that developers usually expect a big spike in sales when a new headset launches, even more so when you factor in Christmas sales. One studio says that didn't happen with Quest 3S, despite retailers like Amazon reporting high sales. “When Quest 3s launched, you couldn't even tell from the sales data that a new and affordable headset had launched… I think that this is not necessarily due to Quest 3s selling so much less, but due to those players not reaching the store and buying games,” states one studio. One developer believes Meta should implement more mechanisms like Steam Daily Deals to provide indie titles enough sales to cover months of costs. Another points toward both declining sales across the entire gaming industry and a shift toward younger audiences. “This demographic typically spends less compared to adult gamers, raising the question: where have the adult VR gamers gone?” Of course, games aren't guaranteed to be a success at launch, no matter the platform. Even with strong reviews and great marketing, games sometimes just fail to land with an audience for a myriad of reasons. Critical success doesn't equal commercial success and, for a niche market, the end of 2024 delivered a relentless stream of new releases. From October to December, the following games saw release on various platforms: And that's just some of the list. I've never seen such a hefty lineup of big VR games released in such a short timeframe. Some of that could be attributed to the Quest 3S launch, and while most developers we spoke with didn't have the most positive results, it's not impossible to break through or at least get close. In a separate interview outside this report, Flat2VR Studios advised Trombone Champ: Unflattened was close to hitting sales expectations despite the fierce competition. So there's a mix of heavy competition, poor discoverability, search issues, increasing promotion of Horizon Worlds, and a userbase that perhaps isn’t big enough to support such a wide range of games. This hasn't gone well for many, set in context of wider economic issues like the increasing cost of living leaving people with less disposable income. “There's a bigger, more insidious core problem that's happening. The amount of money that consumers are willing to spend on apps that you pay for is shrinking,” Eiche said. Owlchemy doesn't believe declining sales are necessarily due to games reaching the tail-end of their life cycle. He suggested Vacation Simulator and Cosmonious High — which recently received price cuts — have discoverability issues, while Job Simulator still regularly charts in the top 10. Even in such a high spot though, Owlchemy's debut hit is making less money than it once did. “I would love to be like, 'Hey, Job Simulator had a great run.' That's great. But then when I see it in the top 10 or in the top four but the amount it's making is an order of magnitude less, like half as much as it did before,” Eiche said. “That to me says that the overall amount of money being put into the store is shrinking.” This doesn't necessarily mean there are fewer Quest users, but it suggests more are opting for free-to-play experiences over premium content. Meta Quest+ is a subscription program providing access to two pre-selected monthly games and a rotating selection of VR titles via its Games Catalog. It's drawn the inevitable comparisons with Xbox Game Pass, and Sony's own PlayStation Plus service. Meta includes a 3-month subscription with every new Quest 3S headset, meaning anyone who received a headset over Christmas still has this. For some developers, revenue from the programs can close the gap with revenue lost from store sales. Releasing games on Quest+ immediately feels like a “double-edged sword” to some though, with games failing to reach sustainability across both store and subscription channels. Another developer expressed skepticism about subscriptions wholesale, calling the model a “catastrophic disaster” for the music industry. Others just see it as a new name for curation at Meta. “It is a great option and helps users discover great content BUT it cannot be [the] only method for doing so,” one developer said. “Which currently it is.” Some believe Quest+ gives users fewer reasons to go looking for games to purchase, stating this complements Meta's push with moving users to free apps. Despite this, most developers agreed the subscription service is great for consumers. “Quest+ is a form of curation because anything where you pick out apps is a form of curation. I think that's another line of business,” says Andrew Eiche, who calls Quest+ a good way of recommending titles. “I don’t see Meta pushing that as the answer.” With declining Quest sales being a common issue across these studios, has this lead to an uplift in sales across other headsets for multiplatform developers? Based on the developers we spoke with, generally no, but with a few notable exceptions: Still, the exceptions are interesting to note. For example, Into The Radius hit 800k sales while its currently PC VR only sequel reached nearly $3m revenue in early access so far. One CEO reported 90% of sales came from Steam compared to Quest, attributing this to being featured on the Steam front page after participating in themed sales and festivals. Another developer saw 2024 on Steam outperform their sales in 2023 and 2022. Even with Quest being their main source of revenue, one studio advised the difference with Steam is “shrinking more and more.” One studio told UploadVR lower than expected sales on Quest means they'll be focusing on multiplatform launches in the future, naming Steam as a certainty, while PS VR2 and Android XR are “maybe.” GDC's State of the Industry report, which surveyed 3500 developers, advised 59% of VR developers are working on Quest/Horizon games, 31% for SteamVR, 16% for PS VR2, and 8% for Apple visionOS. PlayStation VR2 also appears to be another beneficiary following decreased sales on Quest. Across the last few months, we've seen an increasing number of developers announce ports for Sony's headset. Sinn Studio co-founder Almir Brljak confirmed that Swordsman VR “sold more copies” on PS VR2 than Quest in December, calling the Sony headset's pricing “a huge barrier.” While not a direct indicator of sales, Skydance's Behemoth and Metro Awakening all show more user reviews on PS VR2 than Quest, though Steam shows the highest review count for Metro. Touching upon Into The Radius' success, Fast Travel Games CMO Andreas Juliusson recently stated that sales on PS VR2 “exceeded our expectations.” Elsewhere, Toast Interactive's VR platformer Max Mustard sold better on Sony's headset than Quest in the first two weeks. Some of this can be attributed to the specific audience. Max Mustard likely benefitted fulfilling a genre desire when Astro Bot lacked PS VR2 support, despite Rescue Mission being a PSVR hit, while Into The Radius and Swordsman would suggest PlayStation VR2 owners also prefer more “hardcore” experiences. Even then, one studio behind a more casual game revealed surprising sales. “We have similar numbers on Meta as we do on Steam, but much higher on PlayStation. Given the size of these platforms, it’s unclear to us how this is even possible,” a studio representative said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the increasing struggle with sales on Quest and VR in general, two studios advised they're looking more toward flatscreen gaming. Whether that's for hybrid titles going forward or flatscreen-only wasn't specified, though it's clear these decisions are motivated by financial struggles. “Compared to non-VR sales, it is increasingly feeling like we shouldn't bother with VR or MR at all,” one studio tells me, stating sales for their game's flatscreen edition on Steam outperforms the VR edition on Quest by 500%. “In my opinion, the Quest Store is not on a good path. As a result, we will see a good amount of VR studios close or pivot to non-VR in the next years, leading to a big drop in quality games 2-3 years down the line,” said one developer. A couple of developers expected layoffs and closures from many that don't pivot to flatscreen titles. With PowerWash Simulator VR support being officially dropped, other studios evidently aren't finding Quest profitable, though FuturLab's port faced criticisms at launch. Crucially, this avoided layoffs and saw the staff members redeployed to other projects. Eiche described this as a “smart business decision” because FuturLab didn’t wait until layoffs became inevitable. The last two years for many VR studios have been rough. The wider games industry remains in a rough state, tens of thousands of developers have lost their jobs and VR gaming has been hit too. WIMO Games, Archiact, First Contact Entertainment, Sony's London Studio, and Ready At Dawn have all shut down since 2023. Other big names hit by layoffs include nDreams, Lode, TinyBuild, Codemasters, VRChat, Soul Assembly, XR Games, Toast Interactive, Resolution Games, Firesprite, Humble Games, Supermassive Games, Downpour Interactive and, most recently, Fast Travel Games. We've received emails from folks looking for contract positions as some studio heads look to “work for hire” jobs to keep their workers employed. “I can still get by because I'm solo, but if I had employees there would be no way this would be sustainable,” one developer said. Some developers also highlighted their worries about Meta's recent changes to its content moderation policies across Threads, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, which includes removing fact-checking. These recent moves saw CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused of aligning himself with President Trump before his inauguration last month. Meta faced heavy criticism both from platform users and its own staff over its updated community standards guidelines, with many worried about the rise of hate speech, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia, and more. Meta also removed transgender and non-binary themes from Messenger, killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and removed accommodations for transgender staff. The current Hateful Conduct guidelines as of February 4, 2025, state the following: “We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality.” Meta Quest and Horizon Worlds use a separate Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences. Meta defines “hate-based organizations” in another policy at the company, with a page noting “we cannot estimate prevalence for organized hate right now.” Meta's moderation landscape is changing rapidly, and its efforts to scale toward billions of users continues to bend heavily toward automated systems at multiple layers. Evidence recently emerged via VR enthusiast Lunayian that Meta could be dropping moderators reviewing the last few mins of audio/video after you report other users in Horizon Worlds. One developer questioned how much longer they can ethically do business with such an organization. We intend to explore this particular area further fully in a separate report. If you have information to share with us, or in particular a developer looking to share your thoughts on Meta's recent moderation changes, please use our Contact Us page to get in touch or email me: hstockdale@uploadvr.com. Where does this leave the VR market? If you're a VR gamer, some months may seem like there are more older games getting VR mods than new VR games. Even so, there's still a slow but steady drip of indie releases from small teams, as well as occasional tentpoles from well-funded groups with dozens of artists working on a single project. Some developers are hopeful things will change for the better at Meta, while others cannot wait for Valve's rumored Deckard headset. Many praised Meta for keeping the VR market as vibrant as it has been, though another conceded VR adoption has been “slower than expected.” Another criticized the infrastructure around the platform as “suffering from serious growing pains.” One developer believes Meta is shaping the industry in an “unsustainable” direction that’s good for retention from younger audiences – free-to-play – but bad for overall revenue. Others cited concerns about the market shifting so rapidly, while one expressed caution about chasing mixed reality experiences at the expense of VR. One studio cited shifting goalposts during development on Quest as a problem, while another believes mixed reality made some developers “forget about VR.” Clear investments are being made into pushing Horizon Worlds and that's particularly true on mobile, though some remain hopeful that Meta can be persuaded into course correction. In preparation for this article, we reached out to Meta this week with a bulleted list of complaints from developers and questions we're hoping the company can answer. We were told they're preparing a blog post and that went live the following day, though this left numerous questions from us unanswered. We will be following up in the days ahead. As part of our reporting, UploadVR initially put a call-out for responses to a consumer survey. However, this did not receive a wide enough response to be considered viable data for the report.
