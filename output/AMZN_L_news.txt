While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .

Title: Salesforce chief Marc Benioff says AI now does up to half of all the work at his company

UPDATED 19:46 EDT / JUNE 26 2025 by Mike Wheatley Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff says his company is doubling down on the use of artificial intelligence, using the technology to automate dozens of workloads that were, until recently, done by humans. In an interview with Bloomberg, Benioff (pictured) said AI agents are now performing as much as 30% to 50% of all the work at his company. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher-value work,” Benioff said. The problem for some Salesforce employees is that they’ll need to find another employer who’s willing to pay them to perform that higher-value work. Earlier this year, the company announced it’s laying off about 1,000 of its staff. Although it has also announced plans to hire another 1,000, these new employees will be focused on selling its Agentforce technology. What that means is that those new workers will be tasked with urging other companies to adopt AI that can automate work normally done by humans, potentially encouraging them to replace some of their own employees. It’s a worrying trend that seems to be catching on. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a letter to employees where he discussed the company’s increased adoption of generative AI tools and admitted that it will likely need “fewer people” in future than it currently employs. The rise of AI comes at a time when technology companies are looking for new ways to try and cut costs and boost efficiencies, and many have already announced plans to achieve that by sacrificing human workers. For instance, Microsoft Corp. had already cut more than 6,000 jobs in May and is now reportedly undergoing a second round of layoffs while investing more in AI, according to Fast Company. Google LLC has also reportedly trimmed people from various departments. The website Layoffs.fyi says more than 63,000 jobs have disappeared in the tech industry so far this year, and there are growing reasons to think AI is at least partly responsible for this trend. In his latest newsletter, Brian Merchant, author of “Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech,” writes that he has spoken with dozens of tech industry workers who have been affected by the adoption of AI. He claims that the technology is rapidly reshaping Silicon Valley’s workforces. According to Merchant, an employee at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. told him that his company’s recent round of layoffs saw many new hires booted out and replaced with AI, despite saying publicly it was about cutting underperforming staff. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week,” the employee said. An employee at Dropbox Inc. made similar claims about his employer, saying that during its recent round of layoffs, the entire team focused on improving the reliability of its products was let go in favor of AI tools that can automate this work. Benioff told Bloomberg that the workforce is now undergoing a “digital labor revolution” and said his company’s AI agents can perform work with an accuracy of about 93%. “It’s pretty good, but it’s not realistic to hit 100%,” Benioff said, pointing out that other companies are at “much lower levels because they don’t have as much data and metadata.” Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Monster and CareerBuilder, once popular with job seekers, file for bankruptcy

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 3:14:47 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Monster and CareerBuilder, once two of the most popular websites for job seekers at the height of the dot-com era, have filed for bankruptcy. The two sites, which merged last year to become one entity named Monster + CareerBuilder, voluntary filed for Chapter 11 Tuesday, announcing that the company is selling various parts of its businesses to several buyers as part of a court-supervised process, a press release said. Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

Those websites, ALL job seeker websites that I tried, were a waste of time, and I tried many...” Oh, I should perhaps clarify. While it is “indeed” true that I have never found so much as ONE single, paying job off of any of those sites, that’s not to say that I never got any contacts. However, the ONLY contacts I got were from the types of outfits, where I would get a call from a secretary, who would start with things such as: “Hello, I am from Dacoit & Scoundrel Associates, and wanted to inform you that Mr. McCartney has reviewed your CV, and is very interested in meeting with you to discuss it further...” (deliberately vague for about three more sentences as she’s in the process of “setting up an appointment”, and pushing for further personal details. Then she sets us up the bomb: “When you come to your appointment, please bring a $2,500 certified cheque...” From my end: “Uhmmmmm...” (awkward pause because I want to at least TRY to be diplomatic, but I ultimately fail): “...only twenty-five hundred, huh? Yeah, honey, I’ll get right on that.” I found the job I have had for the past 15 years on Career Builder. Got laid off on a Monday and was at my new job on Wednesday. Worked out well. I haven’t messed with those two websites in forever. LinkedIn is the only place I go, though I am not actively looking for work at this time.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Radio broadcaster and podcast company Audacy is shuttering Pineapple Street Studios, which had produced original audio shows and companion podcasts for TV shows like “House of the Dragon,” “Severance” and “The Last of Us.” With the shutdown of Pineapple Street, nearly 30 employees are being laid off, according to sources familiar with the company. Audacy, previously known as Entercom Communications, had acquired Pineapple Street for a reported $18 million in 2019.

We’re sorry to say goodbye to talented colleagues and are grateful for their contributions.” Popular on Variety Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management. In March, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions. Pineapple’s shows for TV networks included official podcasts for HBO and HBO Max series “And Just Like That…,” “Chernobyl,” “Dune: Prophecy,” “Hacks,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” Its companion shows for Apple TV+ include podcasts for “Foundation” and “Severance.” According to its website, Pineapple also sold multiple originals for TV and film development, including “Wind of Change” to Hulu, “Missing Richard Simmons” to Amazon Studios, “Heaven’s Gate” to HBO Max and “The Clearing” to Chernin Entertainment. Audacy plans to continue producing podcasts in association with other media companies. Pineapple Street had produced the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s official “Severance” podcast. Going forward, that is now being produced by Audacy Podcasts, in partnership with Red Hour and Great Scott. Five new episodes of “The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller & Adam Scott” will be released weekly on Thursdays beginning June 26, available across all podcast platforms. In addition, a set of new episodes is slated to be released in the fall of 2025. According to the Pineapple Street Studios site, the company was founded in 2016 by Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky. The studio has staff based in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In March, Audacy named Kelli Turner its permanent president and CEO while also announcing the departure of four top execs. The shutdown of Pineapple Street was first reported by Bloomberg. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Grads facing tough job market

WASHINGTON — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Title: Salesforce CEO Claims Half of the Company’s Work Is Now Done by AI

While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company’s work is now completed by AIâthough no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he’ll be giving up. âAll of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,â Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce’s employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company’s own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it’s ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company’s workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That seems to be the underlying message of much of tech’s embrace of AI: get ready for layoffs. Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Microsoft is in the midst of a second round of layoffs, per Fast Company, after already cutting its staff by 6,000 in May and shifting lots of money into AI investments. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. Oftentimes, whether it’s made explicit or not, corporate adoption of AI is the underlying reason for the cuts. Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, recently spoke with tech workers who have been affected by AI and found that the technology is reshaping jobs and workforces as a whole. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service’s reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool. artificial intellienceLaborlayoffsmarc benioffSalesforce Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022.

She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT’s hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It’s a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn’t hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said.

by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade WASHINGTON -- While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z

Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape workforces. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforces. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several tech companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Procter & Gamble, have announced layoffs of thousands of workers over the past several months. Recently, retail service provider Shopify said that teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, plans to replace its external workers with AI gradually. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders, with Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, warning of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany, believes that the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argue that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The efficacy of many AI tools will also depend on how well they are integrated into workplaces, and the willingness and ability of workers to use them. If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urges companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Title: Bernie Sanders Slams Job Cuts, Says AI Should Give Workers More Time Off: 'Instead Of Throwing You Out On The Street...'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period. See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Devastating Layoffs Hit the Walt Disney Company

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

BREAKING NEWS Christopher Rugaber Associated Press Published: June 25, 2025 at 5:23 PM Updated: June 26, 2025 at 3:02 PM Christopher Rugaber Associated Press WASHINGTON – While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. Recommended Videos “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

It started with the meta horror of Alan Wake, and has since expanded with Control, a game that turns a bureaucratic government office into a sinister and unsettling battleground. Their worlds merge the surreal and the mundane — which is not a bad description of Remedy itself. On the day I visited, the studio’s energy was relaxed and subdued — in true Finnish style, there are even multiple onsite saunas — and frankly a little boring, especially for a creative team known for the likes of the mind-bending Ashtray Maze or “Old Gods of Asgard” musical. But that contrast is also one of the keys to Remedy’s recent success. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the video game industry has experienced studio closures, persistent layoffs, corporate meddling, and ill-fated games that were canceled soon after launch. Exceptions like Remedy have been rare. Over the past decade, the studio has been implementing a plan to help it compete with bigger, better-funded developers and publishers, steadily inching its way from a work-for-hire studio to one in charge of its own destiny. As the industry has shifted toward live-service hits like Fortnite and blockbusters like Grand Theft Auto, Remedy has taken big swings with ambitious and delightfully strange narrative titles. Now it’s trying to expand even further with its first multiplayer — and self-published — game in FBC: Firebreak. The stakes are high: it’s the perfect example of Remedy’s new way of working and a proof of concept for its larger, more expansive future. It’s also a strange experience, marrying the surreal tone of Control with co-op play that bucks the latest online gaming trends. But to hear it from the Finnish developer, it only gets to take swings like Firebreak because it nailed all of the boring stuff first. “We are this building,” explains creative director Mikael Kasurinen. “This is it; this is us. We aren’t owned by anybody else, and I think that realization brings that culture of taking more responsibility. There is nothing above us that will save the day if things go wrong. It’s all on us.” This wasn’t the case for much of the studio’s existence. Founded in 1995, Remedy’s first release was a combat racing game called Death Rally. A few years later, the studio garnered widespread acclaim with 2001’s Max Payne, a hard-boiled noir with action ripped out of a John Woo movie. After a sequel, Remedy expanded in new directions with the survival horror game Alan Wake and sci-fi game / TV show hybrid Quantum Break. Despite its modest success, though, the studio found itself stuck in a cycle of working from game to game. It didn’t own any of its creations — instead, they were the property of publishers like Rockstar and Microsoft — and, with the exception of the rapid 18-month development of Max Payne 2, Remedy was only putting out new games every five years or so. That half-decade cycle meant that if any game failed, so did the company. This put Remedy in a precarious position, and it’s something Tero Virtala realized right away when he took over as CEO in 2016. “At that point Remedy had been around for 20 years, and succeeded in relation to many criteria,” Virtala says. That included releasing several hit games and steadily growing in headcount. But Virtala says that “it didn’t feel like enough” to have such a talented team and only release one game every four or five years. While it’s typical for games to take years to build, only having one project at a time left the studio vulnerable in case any of them flopped. Virtala helped spearhead a new path for Remedy’s future built on two pillars: One was becoming a multi-project studio, so that it was less dependent on any single game. Second, Remedy also wanted ownership of its original creations and to eventually become its own publisher. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it.” A major part of making this work was ensuring that everyone in the studio bought in and understood the plan, not just management. It sounds like a controversial idea and runs counter to the way the industry typically works: whereas most studios operate with clear lines dividing creative and business, Virtala believed that empowering developers to understand the business side meant they’d be better able to make the right decisions on the creative end. “People are smart,” Virtala says of his employees, “and they are mature enough to understand that if you want to make creative, ambitious games, it’s not possible unless you have the financial basis, unless you are aligned with the technology, unless you have the people and the production plans are in order. We try to provide the teams with as much information as possible. And then the teams are in the best place to try to figure out what is the best creative path within these constraints.” And it seems that the creative side has bought in. Sam Lake has been with Remedy for nearly its entire 30-year existence, starting out as a writer on Death Rally. (He’s also the face of the original Max Payne — literally.) He now serves as creative director and is the lead writer behind all of Remedy’s major franchises. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it,” Lake says. “When you’re creating a game concept, there are a lot of decisions being made, and the more you understand about what these decisions affect, the better you are prepared to choose wisely.” The real turning point came with the launch of Control in 2019, the first game released under Virtala’s leadership. While the idea for the story and world had been kicking around in Lake’s head for some time, the actual development happened as Virtala was implementing broader studio changes. He pushed for more efficient processes and timelines, hoping to make games faster without sacrificing the quality level Remedy had become known for. “Those three years were transformative for Remedy,” Kasurinen says. He notes that this new development style meant planning much more in advance on Control, and viewing limitations around budgets and timelines as creative challenges “that forced us to reinvent many things in a good way.” When it came out, Control exemplified exactly what the studio wanted to be: it was developed in a comparatively brisk three years, was a brand-new property that the studio would (eventually) own outright, and was in development alongside another project in collaboration with Korean publisher Smilegate. Creatively, it also allowed the team to attempt a new kind of open-ended action game and it opened up new directions for the future. Control’s success allowed this plan to continue. Since then, Remedy has steadily expanded. Control was followed by a long-awaited sequel to Alan Wake, and the studio has grown to 380 people. It currently has four projects in development: a sequel to Control, remakes of the Max Payne games, an unannounced title, and its first multiplayer game, the recently launched Control spinoff FBC: Firebreak. With the exception of Max Payne, which is being published by Rockstar, all of its in-development games are self-published. Remedy now also holds the publishing rights for Alan Wake (the sequel was originally published by Epic Games), and has created its own connected universe, which unites the worlds of Alan Wake and Control. In 2024 it partnered with Annapurna Pictures to potentially expand this even further through film and TV adaptations. Branching out into new genres and mediums is a further attempt to grow Remedy’s capabilities — and to better insulate itself from the volatile whims of the games industry. Getting to this moment required some structural changes. Remedy now has multiple development teams, with staff shifting between them as needed, and it also has a unique setup with two creative directors in Lake and Kasurinen. Lake says that both of them want to be hands-on when they’re leading a new game, and so having two people in the role allows the creative side to always be involved in larger studio decisions, even in the midst of an intense development process. “When I was deep into Alan Wake 2, I wasn’t a part of attending weekly management meetings,” Lake says. “I just needed to focus on [the game]. But it’s really important that we have the creative side represented on the company level. So this arrangement gives us flexibility. We can represent each other.” Even still, the transition wasn’t always smooth. As Remedy attempted to grow into a multi-project studio, not all of its expansion attempts worked out. First, the studio partnered with Smilegate on a new iteration of the popular military shooter Crossfire. The idea was that Smilegate would make the multiplayer portion of the game, while Remedy would craft a single-player story mode, giving the studio a chance to make its first first-person shooter. But CrossfireX was poorly received upon release in 2022 — campaign mode included — and shut down a year later. Remedy also attempted to get into the world of free-to-play games through a partnership with Tencent, but the title — known as Project Vanguard — eventually shifted to a premium release, before finally being canceled before it was ever shown to the public. Virtala says that these setbacks were largely a result of pushing too far too fast. And in the case of Vanguard, the failure helped the studio realize that four games at a time was the sweet spot for what the company could manage. “We started to feel that we had a bit too many projects for our size of organization,” he explains. “We saw that if we had a bit more focus, it would help our other projects to succeed.” But those failures don’t mean Remedy is done trying new things. In fact, the studio’s first fully self-published game, FBC: Firebreak, is also one of its most surprising releases. It’s a multiplayer shooter, which might sound like an odd release from a studio known for single-player narratives. But as the studio looked to expand, multiplayer was one of the key areas the team wanted to explore. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences.” Firebreak is a relative baby step in that direction. It’s connected to a popular game the studio owns, and it was built by a small internal team. While regular updates are planned — including “major” releases in the fall and winter — Firebreak isn’t a live-service game on par with Fortnite or Call of Duty, designed to keep players coming back with ongoing events and daily activities. It’s a paid game meant explicitly to “respect the player’s time.” It’s also a way for the studio to expand its capabilities without stretching the team too far. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences,” says Mike Kayatta, game director on Firebreak. “I like to think that we know what we’re doing when it comes to these large, single-player story-driven games. This is how the studio built its reputation and what it’s good at. When you’re faced with saying, ‘Hey, we need to diversify the types of experiences we’re making,’ do you really just want to just make five more of these linear, story-driven games?” So far, Firebreak’s release hasn’t gone exactly to plan. It was greeted with mixed reviews from critics and players, many of whom complained that, while it maintains some of the weird and unsettling tone as Control, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. But the studio seems intent on fixing things, recently posting an extensive list of patch notes and other upcoming changes that cover everything from the onboarding experience to the UI. “Several things have gone well,” the studio wrote. “Clearly, not everything has.” The success of a game like Firebreak is still critical for Remedy even under its multi-project structure. It’s a complex plan that has kept Virtala very busy over the last 10 years. In fact, when I spoke to him in an empty conference room at Remedy’s office, he was delayed because he had to prepare for the studio’s most recent financial report the next day. “Every single game is highly important for us,” Virtala says. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.” This feeling is only strengthened by the current realities of the gaming industry. It’s a space where even a well-funded EA studio can’t get a Black Panther game made, a Sony-backed multiplayer shooter in development for eight years, Concord, is quickly shuttered, and the likes of Netflix and Amazon are struggling to make headway despite huge investments. Remedy is currently in a good place, with a growing back catalog and multiple games in development, and while it has grown, it’s still a fraction of the size of most other studios making big-budget games, which often have headcounts in the thousands. While the last decade has been a big shift at Remedy, Lake describes his time at the studio as being filled with constant change, as the company steadily grew in terms of both staff and the scale of its projects. Even still, he believes that the current incarnation of the studio might be ideal for this multi-project structure, and says that he “would be surprised” if Remedy continued to grow significantly over the next few years. While many large studios are seemingly focused on perpetual growth, the team at Remedy is happy to be sustainable. “There were a couple of false starts trying to get there, but now it feels very much like we’re settled,” says Lake. “This is what Remedy is now.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Title: This is how over 40% of NYC bookstores became unionized.

Time Published: 2025-06-24T17:53:53Z

The books world has been full of labor action in the last few years, most recently with Quirk Books voting to form a union with the NewsGuild and Abrams Books winning their vote to form a union with the UAW. Bookstores have especially been at the forefront of this push to organize. On May Day, I went to an event at Verso’s offices featuring unionized booksellers talking about their work and their organizing. One fact jumped out at me: over 40% of all bookstores in New York City are unionized, which is four times the nation average. That 40% is likely about to be even higher with the news that The Center for Fiction just won voluntary union recognition. How did bookstores in New York get to such a high union density? I spoke to five bookstore workers in NYC about their experiences organizing, how COVID changed the perceptions of their work, and how they find inspiration in each others’ struggles. Thanks to Aaron, Pilar, Henri, Joe, and Maritza for taking the time to talk to me. Their responses, which were so in depth and thoughtful, have been edited for length and clarity. Aaron Lascano, shop steward, writer, game designer, and Senior Bookseller at Barnes & Noble Union Square, RWDSU Maria Pilar Beddall, bookseller at Book Culture, with RWDSU Henri Seguin, bookseller at The Center for Fiction, RWDSU Joe Gross, poet and Lead Visual Merchandiser at The Strand, UAW Local 2179 Maritza Montañez, improviser and buyer at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, RWDSU AARON: I wanted to organize a union at Barnes & Noble because every single one of my coworkers deserved to be treated and paid better … workers at other companies like Amazon and Starbucks had begun their own union campaigns to win better pay and working conditions. They showed us the path forward—the only way to regain power in the workplace and to bring your employer to the bargaining table is to unionize. HENRI: I had been asking around about a union because I came from Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. (Editor’s note: They started their own union!) Elliot Bay had this really wonderful structure they had started during COVID and fought for during that crazy time. So they were just total seasoned veterans of union work and the benefits that it brought to the space … So I came in [to The Center for Fiction] very eager and with some backgrounds in that work. And then getting into the Center, it was lot different than I expected. It’s not just a bookstore, it’s also a cafe, and it’s also a nonprofit. And so although it’s a small organization, I saw a lot of the same issues as at Elliott Bay … And then there was a big renegotiating of contracts at the end of the year. A lot of shuffling around that—you know, I can’t totally speak to everyone’s experience—but my own, I was told one thing and then didn’t get that in terms of pay … It was a big upset and we started discussing how to fix this, and how the Center can work in the long term, because it just didn’t feel, without the union, like it had longevity in the system. So we saw [the union] as a tonic to fix these structural issues. PILAR: We need unions, we have always needed unions, without them we have no real chance of a better, more just future. MARITZA: Most of my extended family has spent decades in physically demanding jobs, and many of their hardest jobs as migrant or seasonal farm workers offered the fewest protections. I took their stories to heart and cared about worker rights sort of implicitly. I didn’t anticipate organizing myself, but working in retail changed me a lot and made me more comfortable talking to people, including my coworkers. Eventually it became clear that we wanted similar things from our jobs, and that it would be safest to advocate for ourselves with formal union protections. JOE: In short, non-union life is no kind of life. AARON: I think I talked a lot about a union as stability. A union contract sets pay and certain policies clearly, meaning you’re no longer at the whims of management. You can bargain out policies to protect people in case of layoffs or store closure (which we did), you can bargain for more safety training and a clear banning policy (which we did). Without a union, we felt like bookselling wasn’t a job you could depend on for more than a year. JOE: We talked about precarity. We talked about being the lowest paid unionized booksellers in the city, which had become common knowledge inside and outside the shop as people who worked or applied to work at other shops filtered through. …We talked about how many of us worked two jobs or picked up freelance assignments to make ends meet. A bargaining committee member who wanted to continue working at The Strand but couldn’t afford to left the store early in negotiations and returned home—we talked about that. MARITZA: Our earliest conversations were casual in tone, validating, and a huge relief. One of my coworkers got a handful of BIPOC booksellers she trusted from both stores to join a Zoom after her last day at the store, and we essentially had a three-hour venting session as our first meeting. After that, our meetings got much more structured but it felt very much like we were looking out for one another and trying to make meetings as easy as possible to attend. PILAR: Because we need to! The threat of Bezos, and the more existential threats posed by capitalism and the government mean that the interests of booksellers and the literal work of book selling is more important than ever. And probably in the face of Trump and everything else, owners and bosses seem much less formidable. JOE: My longtime friend since elementary school, Aaron Lascano, was working at Barnes & Noble Union Square and helping to negotiate his bargaining unit’s first contract while I was assisting with Strand workers’ contract renegotiations, and of course we spoke to each other about our various victories and defeats until eventually we got members of our bargaining committees into a room together and began trading information. We showed up for each other’s rallies and pickets where we could, and RWDSU research…confirmed our suspicions that Strand workers were earning less than any other unionized booksellers in the city. The big takeaway from their reporting, though, was that upwards of 40% of all book shops in NYC were unionized, which is extremely high for any industry and opens a world of possibility in terms of contract alignment, the creation of industry-wide standards, and a base from which to organize related industries. AARON: I think that part of it has to do with the types of workers that bookstores draw. There are plenty of students working at my shop, but there are also a lot of working artists (writers, actors, etc.), as well as people who have previously held unionized jobs as mail carriers, truck drivers, and teachers … We also are kind of in a bookstore resurgence–in NYC, B&N is really coming back, but the smaller stores are seeing it too. So we’re working harder days, moving more product and talking to more people, and we’re not seeing our pay rise with the rise in sales and work unless we unionize. HENRI: Bookstores and the larger literary world is an industry of passion and personal interest. It’s very easy to gloss over a lot of issues because you’re sharing your love of literature, and of books, and you have a community of like-minded people around you. But the thing about COVID is that it really stripped us down to “oh, no, it’s a service industry job.” It’s minimum wage, you’re under the heel of a lot of pressures, and you don’t have a lot of agency when it came down to it… you’re doing something you love, but you’re not treated in a loving manner. MARITZA: It almost feels cliche to say, but I really do think the pandemic pushed a lot of people to act on their values. The economy and our industry shut down and stripped away some of the biggest perks that come with bookselling and left a lot of booksellers with just the toughest parts of our jobs. I think a lot of us had similar experiences: we lost the higher paying jobs and gigs that subsidized our low bookseller wages, and we either risked our health for low wages or got laid off by employers who received PPP loans. Many of my newer coworkers came from other industries that also got shaken up by the pandemic and were surprised by conditions so many booksellers accepted as industry standards, and that really reframed our expectations as well. JOE: And we read. Anyone who reads history knows the only reason any workers anywhere have any sort of rights is because past workers formed unions, and radical, militant ones at that. AARON: I was most surprised by how quickly people were willing to step up. Bargaining took about a year and half, and in that time, we had a lot of different people volunteer their time to help run the union. Even as new people got hired at B&N, they’d immediately get involved by coming to bargaining and making time to meet with the committee. Keeping any shop organized is difficult and time consuming, and it can only be done if workers step up to make it happen. JOE: Organizing tests whether you’ll show up for something that’s possible but not yet probable, and every one of my comrades did. MARITZA: I was anxious about talking to people who might think bookselling is too easy a job to organize, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many workers in other industries immediately understand that bookselling is worth unionizing. More and more people agree that workers benefit from unions regardless of what industry they work in. HENRI: It’s been really encouraging to see the different workers and my colleagues step up in really encouraging ways. You know someone through their function at work, but the union work has really broadened that perspective. I’ve seen my colleagues and now my friends stay up late,wake up super early, plan all sorts of sort of contingencies and write drafts letters. And to see that work was a reflection of our commitment to The Center and its mission, it just makes the workspace feel a lot more purpose driven and inviting. AARON: I’ve been inspired by the progress we’ve made as a unionized industry. In NYC, the RWDSU now covers B&N, McNally Jackson, Book Culture, and Greenlight. I’ve started organizing meetings with shop stewards from those stores and also Strand (covered by the UAW), so we can begin having conversations about building a new standard. I firmly believe that, if unions are to really make headway and regain power in this country, they need to provide a robust vision for working people. It can’t just be about raises, it has to be about reclaiming power, reclaiming dignity, reclaiming time from our jobs. And to get there, to really get contracts that can change people’s lives, unions have to link arms and act in concert with one another. We have to bargain together, picket together, and strike together. We have to re-learn what solidarity means and how to effectively perform solidarity. JOE: So many people showed up for us when our negotiations stalled and we went on strike: the patrons who boycotted the store, comrades from Alamo Drafthouse, Cinema Village, and Nitehawk Cinemas who are currently negotiating their own contracts, comrades from UAW Region 9A and UAWD, comrades from the RWDSU, and socialist elected officials from across the city including Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. I’m grateful, and I think people are realizing the existential importance of organizing outside traditional political structures, and unions are key to providing alternative avenues of engagement. Unions should not be siloed in singular shops. They are political vehicles, and the most obvious ones at that. MARITZA: It’s been inspiring to recognize that we’re part of a larger labor movement. The organizer who worked most closely with us at Greenlight also worked with Amazon workers in Bessemer, and that was humbling for me. I am sappy so the things that most inspire me are hearing my coworkers advocate for each other or praise each others’ work. I also love little and tangible things, like so many of my coworkers got new and long-overdue glasses after our first contract because the company agreed to a vision plan for part-timers, and that felt like a small but important and immediately actionable win. MARITZA: My advice is to do it! And more specifically: make space for your coworkers to talk. Not everyone is comfortable complaining about work, especially at work– give your coworkers a safe place to talk, maybe on Zoom or some bar where their complaints won’t be overheard by the wrong people at the wrong time. Then give people some grace while you find common ground. Very practically, I’d recommend researching similar workplaces that have unions and find a contact there to start walking you through what you need to do (and stress that you want to be discreet). If you’re in an industry that hasn’t historically had many unions, think about what the day-to-day of your work looks like, and see if there are parallels in another industry. AARON: Before I started my own journey, all I could think about was how much better my coworkers deserved. I knew that we could and would win this campaign, that we could and would improve our lives. But I didn’t anticipate how our campaign would ripple outwards. The militancy of the B&N campaign, which involved actions including delegations, practice pickets, and a couple of walkouts, made conditions more favorable for other union campaigns to push back against their bosses. We rallied and picketed with Strand, took note of the concessions their bosses made to them, and then the concessions our bosses made to us were noted by other bookstores that were re-negotiating their contracts. The work that we did at B&N Union Square, B&N Park Slope, B&N Upper West Side, Strand, etc., didn’t just improve our individual stores. It helped improve the lives of hundreds of workers around NYC. JOE: Talk about the shit that sucks. Don’t get any lofty ideas to start with; just complain to and commiserate with each other about every little and big way your job drains you and disrespects you and you’ll find that Baldwin quote about Dostoevsky proven true: your pain and heartache aren’t unprecedented in the history of the world and you share the path toward their alleviation. And never, under any circumstances, accept a tiered contract. PILAR: Do it, talk to each other, ask questions, reach out to members, and remember that no one has ever relinquished power willingly, even for things as small as better hours, or more holiday time. AARON: I am reading Roberto Bolaño’s Savage Detectives. I’m Latino, and I’ve been spending more time reading and thinking about Latino history, politics, and culture. I think Bolaño does an incredible job at capturing the fallout of American-backed coups and American imperialism in Latin America. PILAR: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. JOE: Andrei Platonov’s Chevengur, which is a novel of ardent ennui that follows the forays of the October Revolution into the expanse of the Russian steppe and the people navigating that horizon, the space between the joining of a fight that was always going on whether they acknowledged it or not and the future they hope to win from it. MARITZA: I’m currently reading Miriam Toews’ A Truce That Is Not Peace and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s Cursed Daughters. HENRI: One that I adored is this very strange book called One or Two by H.D. Everett. It’s [published] by Mandylion Press who highlight lost feminist and female writers, and this book is about a woman who, in order to lose weight, exorcises her body, and then that exorcised clump of weight that she loses gains sentience and haunts her. And it’s also probably the most beautiful book binding I’ve seen in a long time. It’s an absolutely gorgeous little book. AARON: Solidarity is altruism, faith, strength … You engage this fight not knowing where it will go, not knowing that you’ll succeed, but knowing that you have a moral obligation to stand with fellow workers… it begins with the basic understanding that our fight is one fight, and that an injury to any worker is an injury to every worker. HENRI: For me, solidarity is just very simply showing up when things get hard. Especially just across the nation, there’s been a lot of examples of moments where showing up is the hardest thing to do, but it is the most important thing. And I’ve seen it at The Center, which is really wonderful. I’ve seen workers who are at their limits reach out for help and people lift them up… it’s kind of banal, but I think at its core it’s just showing up when it’s hard. JOE: Solidarity is a full and complete commitment to causes that nominally are not your own because you realize that every human cause is of mortal importance when you live in the same time and space and can only affect a real reduction in suffering by collectively exerting the power of all peoples. Either everyone has unalienable rights or no one does. MARITZA: For me, solidarity means mutual support, a willingness to take risks for one another and protect one another, and a feeling of investment in each other’s well-being. PILAR: Solidarity means remembering that we are not alone in the struggle, that victories have been won before and will be won again, as long as we fight together.

Title: Google Has Reportedly Cut its Smart TV Budget by 10%

Google has reportedly cut the budget of its smart TV team by 10%, according to a report from The Information, citing people familiar with the situation (via Android Police). The budget cuts are said to be linked with recent layoffs at the Google TV division, despite Google planning to revamp the smart TV platform with its Gemini AI later this year. Google TV is what powers the Google Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV streamer, and various smart TVs and media players made by third-party manufacturers. Back in September, Google announced that there are now over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices on the market. However, it’s hard to see Google taking its smart TV platform as a priority despite aggressive competition from Amazon, Roku, and built-in software experiences from Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS).

"*" indicates required fields Δ Still, a Google representative shared the following statement with The Information. “We continue to invest in Google TV with new user experiences including the upcoming integration of Gemini. There are more than 270 million Android TV devices, and we remain committed to growing this ecosystem with an exciting road map ahead.” According to the report, the budget cuts affecting Google’s smart TV team come at a time when the company is focusing more on YouTube as its main entertainment platform. Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan boldly claimed that “YouTube is the new television,” with TV now being the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. YouTube also brings Google a lot of revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers in the US. The Information reports that Google would like to take the platform into new directions to better compete with streaming platforms like Netflix. YouTube recently hired long-time Disney executive Justin Connolly as its global head of sports and media. The move quickly led Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against YouTube and Connolly. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: If you think your job is hard right now, try working in HR
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hr-workers-miserable-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-24T08:35:03Z

Over the past 18 months, Evan Loveless has led seven rounds of layoffs, personally informing hundreds of his ad-agency colleagues that they were being let go. "It's a chronic feeling of sadness because it's so frequent for me," said Loveless, a senior human-resources partner in St. Louis. "It's like being stuck under a raincloud." Loveless recalled a particularly soul-crushing layoff conversation with a worker who thought he was reaching out with news about a promotion. "Sometimes the person's husband or wife also just lost their job," he said. "You see their faces and then their faces haunt you a little bit." Working in HR has never been glamorous, as the occupation often requires enforcing unpopular company rules and decisions. Now, HR professionals say the job is getting downright ugly. Unceasing layoffs, stricter return-to-office mandates, immigration raids in the workplace, and a sudden need to help everyone master AI are among the latest challenges upending their workloads. "It's a confluence of events that are occurring simultaneously, the likes of which and magnitude of which I never have observed in my more than 30 years of being a human-capital leader," Jim Link, chief human resources officer for the Society of Human Resource Management, told Business Insider. The new rigors come after another tumultuous period for HR workers. During the pandemic years, they suddenly had to develop and manage remote-work set-ups, grapple with anti-vaccine pushback, and deal with employee tensions and calls to action following the murder of George Floyd. Today, HR teams are juggling even more, said Tracy Brower, a Ph.d sociologist in Michigan who researches organizational behavior. "The demands on HR today are significant, increasing, and intense," said Brower. One of the new tasks HR is having to deal with is the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the workplace. Several times a week foreign workers now come to Alexandra Valverde, an HR director for a midsize food manufacturer in the Southeast, with concerns about getting swept up in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Some have tears in their eyes. "This is the hardest year I've had in HR," said Valverde, who's been working in the industry since 2019. "The fear I'm seeing from employees, even if their status is completely fine — that is something I hadn't experienced before." The steady drumbeat of layoffs is also particularly unsettling for HR workers at companies with staffers on H1-B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily live and work in the U.S. if they meet certain criteria. "It's never easy to lay anybody off, but it's even harder when you're telling someone they're probably going to leave the country," said Mike Smart, an HR executive at a California tech company. Upon losing a job, H1-B workers typically have just 60 days to find another employer or face deportation. "Even in the best of job markets, 60 days isn't ample by any stretch," said Smart. As of May, employers have announced 696,309 job cuts this year, an 80% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Making matters worse, the cuts are coming at a time when company chiefs are warning of even more layoffs coming down the line due to the rise of generative AI and AI agents. Last week Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company's extensive use of the technology is expected to reduce its total corporate workforce, which totaled approximately 1.5 million last year. CEOs of other companies, including chatbot maker Anthropic, freelance-job site Fiverr, and payments provider Klarna, have recently issued similar declarations. HR workers are used to taking heat for implementing policies that don't sit well with workers. But lately they say it's gotten a lot harder to keep their cool. In the second quarter, employees at organizations that experienced layoffs in the past year committed 67% more acts of so-called workplace incivility on average than those at firms without such cuts, according to new SHRM data. Those acts, which the trade group says includes silencing and excessively monitoring colleagues, were also 63% higher among workers at organizations with return-to-office mandates than at those without. David Gaspin, the head of HR for a commercial real-estate company in New York, said that at his previous employer he was hit with "some serious vitriol" from a colleague he thought he had a good relationship with after having to lay this person off last year. The tongue-lashing included comments such as "you're just a corporate tool" and "you're a horrible human being." "That's never easy to hear," said Gaspin. Given the more taxing landscape, it's perhaps no wonder that fewer people are looking for work in HR. Searches for HR jobs on Indeed.com in the first half of this year were down nearly 5% from the first half of 2024, and they've been declining annually since 2021, Indeed data show. Separately, a 2022 study from LinkedIn found HR had the highest turnover rate of any job function. (The job site hasn't updated the report since then.) Rebecca Taylor, a former HR professional in New Jersey who co-hosts a podcast called HR Confessions, said one reason she left the field is that she was tired of always being the office grinch. The final straw came after a worker she was tasked with laying off looked up her parents' landline and called them repeatedly to chastise her. "It was scary," said Taylor, who uses a pseudonym partly because of that incident. If a disgruntled employee is angry enough, she added, what else will they try to find? Jump to

This year’s Cannes Lions, the ad industry’s biggest festival, unfolded against a backdrop of upheaval and anxiety. The industry is at a critical moment—facing “an existential crisis,” as S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell told ADWEEK’s editors—but little of that fear was present on stage. While celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Schwarzenegger took center stage, and teams posed with gold trophies on the red carpet, executives on the ground spoke with ADWEEK about issues such as AI, agency consolidation, and layoffs. The event was also marked by an aggressive land grab, both for literal pieces of the Croisette and for marketing budgets. Certain power struggles were visible throughout the festival: Adobe versus up-and-comer Canva, both of which upped their budgets for activations this year. Amazon versus… everyone else. And Michael Kassan’s 3CV versus his former company, MediaLink. Even in the creative awards, rivalries–such as that between holding companies Publicis Groupe and WPP–were on display. Publicis Conseil, a jewel in the crown of the former holdco, won both Agency of the Year and the Titanium Grand Prix, while WPP was named Creative Company of the Year. In the latest episode of Adspeak, the ADWEEK editorial team reports from the sandy beaches and hot pavements of Cannes about who came out on top at the festival, what’s behind the parties and beachfront activations, and what Cannes says about where the industry is headed.

Title: Amazon Ramps Up Enshittification With Even More Ads On Prime Video
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/23/amazon-ramps-up-enshittification-with-even-more-ads-on-prime-video/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T12:25:00Z
Full Content:
(Mis)Uses of Technology Back in early 2024 Amazon announced that Prime Video customers (who already pay $140 per year) would be charged $3 extra every month just to avoid ads that didn’t previously exist. It was just the latest example of “enshittification” in a streaming sector all out of original ideas, desperate to provide Wall Street with impossible skyward quarterly growth — regardless of consumer annoyance or brand harm. When originally announced, Amazon promised it would try to keep the ad load to three-and-a-half minutes per hour to try and be less annoying than its competitors. But the march toward enshittification yields to no one; 18 months later and Amazon has already doubled that volume of advertisements per hour: “According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.” In the modern era it’s simply not allowed for a public company to offer people an affordable product everyone really likes. The unyielding pressures for quarterly growth at any cost inevitably result in the cannibalization and enshittification of most of your favorite products. It’s obvious everywhere; but particularly in newer industries (like say, video streaming) that were disruptive just a few years earlier. Amazon has told eager investors but hasn’t bothered to communicate the latest enshittifcation to consumers yet. When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) and if it was it would be okay because Amazon is focused on “improving ad experiences”: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” As new growth in streaming customers has slowed down, giant media companies have relegated to seeking old ways to give Wall Street their sweet, sweet, improved quarterly returns. That means not just price hikes, but layoffs, pointless mergers, less money spent on content and residuals (meaning they’re too cheap to keep popular programs online), and crackdowns on things that used to be consumer benefits, like the lax treatment of things like password sharing. The short term stock boosts and tax gains from this kind of gamesmanship and consolidation disincentivizes execs from learning anything useful from the experience. By the time consumers begin a backlash and the brand begins to tank, the executives who led the charge are already off working at a different company on the basis of their “savvy deal-making prowess.” It’s purely extractive and utterly pathological. Consumer interest, employee welfare, and the long term integrity or quality of the brand or product simply have nothing to do with it. In this case, streaming companies are going to keep pushing their luck until piracy sees a massive resurgence (which is already starting to happen), at which point the executives will blame everyone and everything but themselves. Instead of any sort of self-awareness of the doom cycle they participate in, they’ll do something even more harmful: like lobbying Congress to make VPNs illegal. Filed Under: ad load, advertisements, amazon prime, competition, consumers, enshittification, streaming, tv, video Companies: amazon Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown So they’re going to stop showing ads? Hold on, they didn’t say they were gonna do that—just that they’re “committed to” doing it, whatever that means; it’s certainly not a guarantee you can collect on. And, of course, they didn’t say it would be an improvement for the viewers. Maybe they’ll “improve ad experiences” for the advertisers, but I suspect the real improvements be for their own employee-bonuses and for Jeff Bezos’s pocketbook (which may imply accidental short-term benefits to minor shareholders, too). Thank God! I sure was getting bored of watching shows without ads! Giving up Amazon Prime turned out to be much easier and painless than I expected, and that was before they started enshittifying in earnest. Amazon in general turns out to be ridiculously easy to walk away from. I highly recommend doing so. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.

When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) […]: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” This is not a lie, just your standard marketing double-speak. It doesn’t say what Karl says it does. It never actually says ad load isn’t increasing, or won’t be increasing. Rather, it avoids the question entirely, and answers an unasked question about their “commitment” instead. Even their “commitment” is compatible with increasing the number of ads shown, as long as they’re not “simply” doing that. “Improving ad experiences” (for whom?) could include increasing the number of ads. That’s not “simply increasing the number”; it’s increasing the number, combined with doing some other stuff. People have been complaining about the enshittification of Amazon’s shopping site for about a decade now, to no avail. Apparently, counterfeit products are a big concern. I don’t shop there, but I do come across Amazon links from search engines sometimes, and it’s astounding how often (for the last year or two) I’ve seen errors about something failing on Amazon’s end, and asking me to try again. When it does work, even if the search has a brand name, the screen’s often full of other brands instead, and I have to scroll to find whatever the search was for. And most reviews aren’t without logging in now. The thing to remember about Amazon Prime is that most of its customers probably never subscribed because of the streaming. They subscribed for the free shipping, and maybe at some point started watching the video service because it was bundled. If Amazon can get them to not watch the video service, but to stay subscribed, that’s the ideal outcome. Youtube already have dominated the news about war against adblocking, copied Hulu’s pause ads on TV and mobile app, and introduced double non-skip ads. Amazon charges you AND serves you ads. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads (other than sponsors content within the video, if the content creator does that). BIG difference there. You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You’re just one person, and evidence suggests this is not a widespread view. Newspapers and magazines generally did both, plus abused people’s personal data by selling it to postal spammers. (While dead media may not be a great example, that’s not the reason it died.) You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. That’s why I’ve never had a subscription for Sky. Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. They haven’t. I had cable TV (via older relatives) in the 1980s and 1990s, and don’t recall the provider advertising except on the TV guide channel (and maybe the bills, and radio and TV stations). The main ads anyone saw were from the broadcast channels that the cable provider was being paid to relay. What were they gonna do, black those out? Eventually, cable-only networks did appear, some of which had advertising. That sucked, but, again, it was done by the channel providers, not the cable providers. A lot of people, by the way, have been telling satellite and cable TV providers to take a hike. Techdirt’s written about “cord-cutting” many times—but, at this point, I think it’s kind of done, and subscriber counts are going down more due to death than cancellation per se. (If you haven’t watched live television in a while, you may not have noticed that the ads have become targeted to old people—hearing aids, motor-reclining chairs, etc.) I see you have no experience of Sky or Virgin Media in the UK and the former company’s illegal nine-minute-long ad breaks (supposed to be nine minutes per hour, not per ad break), which they have despite also charging fees. Remember: just because you haven’t personally experienced something doesn’t mean it’s never happened, just like we don’t have masked individuals abducting foreign nationals off the streets here, but I don’t believe that’s not happening in the US. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads Maybe not on YouTube, but are they still collecting viewing data and using it for ad targeting elsewhere? Fuck Hulu. – 🇨🇦 “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences Translation: “Our commitment is to ramp up our spying and data mining even more, so as to present viewers with advertisements for items, for example, that they’ve talked about in the presence of an Amazon Echo” Every thing you want to watch on it costs extra. What are you even paying for? What are you even paying for? Generally, people are buying it for the free and faster shipping. Sure, Amazon touts other benefits such as video, but it’s best for them if people don’t use any of that. Preferably not even the shipping benefits (there are ways to get them for free without Prime, and if a subscriber falls into such patterns by accident, their Prime subscription is just free revenue for Amazon). Last I checked uBlock Origin worked on Prime Video ads, but it’s been a little while since I watched Prime Video. In biology, unchecked constant growth is known as cancer. And if capitalism is not brought under control, it will go on to drive humanity right to extinction. I wouldn’t mind the commercials if they were more relevant to my interests. Yes, I know people find relevant ads to be creepy and intrusive, but my point is that Amazon already collects so much data about my shopping habits that I shouldn’t see the same drug ads that I see on regular TV. I stopped watching CBS This Morning because it became drug ads interrupted by a news segment. If I were advertisers, I’d be more picky about the data that the streaming services provide. Do people interact with the ads, such as scanning the QR code, or ignoring it? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? I don’t know what’s cheaper, but I think the bottom line is that advertising companies are able to convince their clients that, whatever it is that the ad company is doing, it’s working. I mean, their business is basically to sell people stuff they don’t need; that doesn’t just apply to the ad viewers. Or if they weren’t the same damn 2 commercials over and over again? Streaming was only ever of value when it was more convenient than piracy. That is no longer the case. It is worse. I paid for ad free, but it has suddenly gone away. Bye Amazon i got’s me one of them raspberry pi’s. it’s nicely loaded with ad blockers! so the likes of prime and you tube can fuck right off! 100% add free! well almost….some video’s have sponsored ads presented by the channel host/ maker. but that can be skipped through. YouTube Premium has rapidly increased in cost over the few couple of years. All the content is freely produced by content creators – nothing is paid for directly upfront any more as far as I know. The content creators are constantly complaining about the lack of revenue. Alphabet keeps promising “improvements” for the increasing price. But as a user I struggle to think of a single improvement, let alone one that benefits me. There are heaps of features I’d love to see but there is no process for users to offer feedback, the only feedback is from content creators and advertisers. If the price increases don’t benefit me or the content creators , that leave one last beneficiary of the price hikes… Over the years I have successfully “voted with my wallet” away from so many services but YouTube really feels like a monopoly – I paid for Pandora for a year but its just too small and found myself just going back to YT. I think only an antitrust action can save the users from Alphabets unbridled greed. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Have a Techdirt Account? Sign in now.
