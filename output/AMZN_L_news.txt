If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Sonos really needed a great product right now. 2024 will be remembered as the year that Sonos nearly torpedoed its brand with the haphazard, premature rollout of an overhauled mobile app. This led to an unprecedented outcry from loyal customers who faced myriad bugs, diminished system performance, and other issues. Many called for CEO Patrick Spence to step down. That didn’t happen, but Sonos has spent the majority of this year on the back foot with apologies, turnaround plans, and assurances that a setback of this magnitude will never happen again. It’s under these undesirable circumstances that Sonos has released the briefly delayed Arc Ultra soundbar. The $999 Ultra is designed to improve on what was already a very capable Dolby Atmos soundbar. After many hours testing the Ultra, I can say it resoundingly succeeds. Software missteps aside, Sonos can still deliver on hardware. The Ultra is a notable improvement in basically every regard, and a worthwhile upgrade — if you’re ready to trust Sonos again. The original Arc arrived during a high point for the company that its executives must desperately miss, back when demand for its products was soaring amid the covid-19 pandemic. The Arc was a strong performer that delivered an impressive level of immersion from a single soundbar, though some customers experienced a loud popping sound caused by a bug that took the company far too long to fix. The Arc had other weaknesses, with bass response at the top of that list. Unless you paired the Arc with a Sub (or the Sub Mini that came later), the soundbar didn’t have enough low-end bite to make you feel the booms and reverberating explosions in Hollywood blockbusters. It’s a downside shared by many soundbars and an inevitable tradeoff that comes with the form factor. In 2022, Sonos spent $100 million to try and overcome that by acquiring a small company called Mayht Holding, which had developed a “revolutionary approach to audio transducers” that allowed them to be smaller and lighter without compromising on sound. The Arc Ultra is the first time we’re seeing that technology in an actual product. It’s being used for a new “SoundMotion” woofer built into the soundbar that produces twice as much bass as the original Arc. It’s a cool-looking thing, and here’s a TL;DR on how it works from Sonos’ press kit: - Distributed lightweight motors displace more air for added bass. - Aerospace-grade aluminium ribs connect the motors for combined power, allowing a smaller enclosure. - Four pairs of opposing magnets power four voice coils for bigger sound in a smaller enclosure. - Reinforced force-cancelling cones minimize vibration for clearer sound. This compact, relatively flat woofer design freed up enough space for Sonos to cram even more drivers (14 in total) inside the Arc Ultra. The original Arc had 11. Such an arsenal of speakers is good enough for the Ultra to deliver a 9.1.4 surround experience. That’s what Sonos’ marketing claims, at least. Don’t get hung up on the numbers; several of those are virtualized phantom channels, and this is still a soundbar at the end of the day. What’s objectively true is that the Arc Ultra produces a soundstage that’s noticeably wider and more dynamic than its predecessor. And it does so in a cylindrical enclosure that’s similar in size and overall design to the original, though this one’s a bit shorter — nice if your TV is on a stand like mine — and slightly longer. The touch controls have been relocated to an upward-facing panel at the rear of the soundbar, with the Arc Ultra now sharing the same button layout as the Era 100 / 300 and Move 2. Hands-free voice commands also remain, though Google Assistant is no longer available. You can use Amazon Alexa, Sonos Voice Control, or both simultaneously. One welcome upgrade is a Trueplay feature called Quick Tune. Like other recent Sonos speakers, the Ultra can use its built-in microphones to tune itself for your environment — without requiring the manual Trueplay process of moving around the room while waving your iPhone around. This means Android users can finally take advantage of Trueplay, or at least this faster version of it, which wasn’t possible on the first Arc. iPhone owners still have the option of doing a more thorough tuning like before. I didn’t notice a meaningful difference between the two, but you might, depending on your room layout. Bluetooth audio playback is also supported on the Ultra after being MIA on the original Arc. There’s a pairing button at the back of the soundbar beside the ethernet jack and microphone mute switch. AirPlay 2 is still on board, and the Ultra makes the jump to Wi-Fi 6 for more dependable wireless performance. Something Sonos hasn’t addressed is the lack of HDMI passthrough. Other premium soundbars let you plug in a game console or disc player without sacrificing another HDMI port on your TV, but Sonos clearly favors simplicity here. I tested the Arc Ultra in three different setups: first by itself; then with the also-new Sub 4 ($799); and lastly with the Sub 4 and a pair of Era 300 speakers as rear surrounds. Even on its own, the improvements over the original Arc are obvious and plentiful. The Sound Motion woofer delivers on its promise, giving the soundbar more oomph and a thicker low end that will likely be more than enough if you’ve got a small to medium-sized living room or are living in an apartment with people below you. Putting bass aside, the Ultra simply has greater clarity, dimensionality, and depth than the Arc. The height effects are more convincing, and everything sounds more expansive without getting thin or too dispersed. I was as captivated by The Wild Robot at home as I was seeing it at an Alamo theater. The Ultra beats out the Arc for music, too. Whether it’s Atmos tracks like Kacey Musgraves’ “Sway” or regular stereo, Sonos’ Sound Motion tech and the added drivers make a difference. I still do most of my music listening elsewhere given the choice, but for relaxing on the couch, this does the trick. Dialogue clarity is also fantastic and the other major reason to consider upgrading from the Arc. Even without enabling the speech enhancement feature, which now has three levels to choose between, the center channel is more impactful. I could clearly hear Christian Bale’s voice over the roar of engines in Ford v Ferrari. Guy Ritchie’s Snatch is an old favorite (and good test for dialogue intelligibility), and it posed no problems for the Arc Ultra. Bringing in the Sub 4 levels up the bass from good to stellar. This configuration also allows the soundbar to concentrate on treble and midrange frequencies, while the dedicated subwoofer takes care of rumbling bass. And yes, if you throw in the pair of Era 300 speakers, you get the full Sonos Dolby Atmos experience. It’s blissful and can be downright mesmerizing, which is what I’d hope for from a bundle that costs over $2,500. If you’re interested in digging into frequency response charts, check out Andrew Robinson’s great YouTube review. Whether used solo or as a package, Sonos has a winner on its hands that can outshine the best from Samsung and other brands. But none of that matters if you can’t rely on the software that controls everything. So, what about the beleaguered new app? My experience during this review was surprisingly headache-free. None of my speakers randomly vanished from the system, and controlling the Arc Ultra was responsive and worked as intended. Adding the Sub and surrounds went off without a hitch. It was all very encouraging, but I fully understand that some people are still having a frustrating time with the app. And new problems continue to arise: early on, there was a Trueplay bug with the Arc Ultra that nerfed bass response. That’s since been resolved, but Sonos needs to keep the performance enhancements and bug fixes coming into the new year and well beyond. Just recently, I’ve seen numerous complaints about a bug that’s badly hampering the Era 300’s surround sound performance — and this affects owners of the original Arc, too. Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the Sonos Arc Ultra, you must agree to: Using Amazon’s Alexa assistant also means agreeing to Amazon’s Alexa terms of use. Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one or more optional agreements. The Arc Ultra is an excellent product and a crucial step in the right direction. It’s a significant improvement over the original and easily in contention for the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy. But this is only one step, and whatever comes next will be the true indication of just where Sonos is headed. If the rumors of a video streaming box are true, Patrick Spence and Co. better have a compelling justification for moving beyond Sonos’ core audio business. The damage from the app episode will be lasting, and it has already led to layoffs and rendered the Ace headphones all but forgotten in less than a year. After going through this ordeal, I wouldn’t blame anyone for holding off on the Arc Ultra until Sonos proves it’s capable of making good decisions again. The company isn’t out of the woods yet. Not even close. But it still knows how to make a damn good speaker, so there’s hope.

Title: The Omnicom-IPG megamerger signals a new era for the ad industry

Hello. Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate, has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday and initially faced local gun and forgery charges. Our team has been covering this developing story — keep up with our coverage here. In today's newsletter, the $13 billion Omnicom-IPG megamerger reflects a new era as Big Tech and AI upend the ad industry. What's on deck: But first, a new ad-venture. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's already been a big week for the ad industry. Omnicom Group said it had reached an agreement to acquire Interpublic Group, a merger worth more than $30 billion that would create the world's largest ad conglomerate. Across the pond at Paris-based Publicis Groupe, the party hats might be staying in the drawer. Just last week, Publicis recruited Snoop Dogg for a video to help celebrate the firm usurping London's WPP to become the world's largest ad holding company. But it's not just about being No. 1. For ad industry insiders, the proposed takeover reflects an ad sector under threat from Big Tech and AI, writes Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. By creating a larger company, Omnicom-IPG will have a bigger base to deploy data and technology, which could give it leverage to secure beneficial and exclusive deals with partners such as cloud providers. Keep in mind, however, that in the short term mergers can be highly disruptive. Concerned clients. Bruised egos. Job cuts. Integrating two companies with 100,000 people combined, dozens of different agency brands, and hundreds of offices across the globe will not be a simple task. There will likely be synergies — including job cuts. "It will be harder to climb the career ladder. Superstar creators and creatives will also be in demand, as well as good strategists, in all disciplines. But, lots of other roles will become diminished," Simon Francis, who leads the marketing consultancy Flock Associates, told BI. However, as Lara highlights, that could create opportunities for smaller agencies, especially as the merged company works its way through the disruption caused by integration, egos being knocked out of joint (it wouldn't be the first time), and potential client conflicts where the new entity suddenly works with two or more fierce rivals in the same sector. "From an M&A perspective, it's only going to add fuel to the fire." That's according to William Ritchie, founding and managing director of advisor firm WY Partners. "I'd expect there is going to be more competition for the best assets and more focus on building a streamlined data and tech-first offering which can compete," he told BI. Private equity has been circling the ad industry, too. Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone have shown interest in media and entertainment. Industry insiders have speculated for months that WPP could be taken private — or at least some parts of it could be. The Insider Today team: Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG could usher in a new, inevitable M&A wave

Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 That’s one hell of a way for the agency holding companies to end the year. Just as everyone was looking to slow down and take a holiday-induced break before what will be a turbulent 2025, along comes Omnicom with a proposed stock-driven acquisition of Interpublic Group. The two CEOs — Omnicom’s John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky — shared on their conference call Monday morning to announce the deal that they have been discussing this combination for the better part of a year. Suffice it to say that, should the deal clear regulatory and shareholder approvals — (those CEOs are hoping it will clear in the second half of 2025) — the combined $30 billion revenue will give the industry the equivalent of a megalodon shark in a sea of great whites and hammerheads. Lest we forget, megalodon went extinct because it was simply too big. So before panic sets in too significantly for the likes of WPP, Publicis and Dentsu, and the myriad independent agencies that have made a living feeding off the fish that the sharks don’t eat, this kind of bigger isn’t always seen as better. But to hear Wren and Krakowsky tell it, this merger makes more sense today than ever. They have their eyes on the Googles and Metas of the world. So much that Krakowsky referred the combined company as a platform rather than a holdco. “Being a part of what is now a platform, essentially a company with exceptional talent and reach and capabilities, and knowing that you can bring those to bear for your client, or that they’re going to give you an opportunity, as John [Wren] says, to build a more interesting career — there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it inside our organization,” he told analysts and reporters on a Monday morning conference call with Wren and both companies’ CFOs. The combined entity would become by far the largest holding company in the communications world, with an expected cash flow of more than $3 billion, according to the information provided by the companies. The principals also cite the complementary resources and geographies. A few examples: But the truth is, both companies needed to do this. Of the six sources reached for this story, all noted that IPG has not had a good stretch the last few years, having lost Amazon, General Motors and several other large and small clients that outweighed its gains. Two sources even said they see Omnicom’s acquisition as a bit of a bailout. “I think this is a very welcome distraction from what has been a disastrous year for IPG,” said one executive outside both companies, who declined to speak for attribution. Added David Jones, CEO of Brandtech Group, a rival to both holdcos: The acquisition “makes huge sense in the short term — both have been having their lunch eaten by Publicis, and IPG declined last year in organic growth. This gives both of them a story for their shareholders. It gives the merged company the ability to carry out financial re-engineering and restatements that will help the numbers look better in the short term.” Ouch. Meantime, the union doesn’t come cheaply. In the Monday conference call, Wren cited $450 million in “one-time cash cost” to close the deal and achieve $750 million in “cost synergies” — which includes layoffs among the 100,000 employees of both holdcos. Oddly, Wren did add, and employees of both companies should take note: “Any employee listening to this, if you’re associated with any revenue stream at all, you’re gold, don’t worry about it.” Observers of the deal don’t think things will end up quite so magnanimously for staffers, particularly those in back-office roles. “This deal will no doubt create a lot of uncertainty for staff and clients on both sides,” said Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “Notwithstanding the cost synergies (and implications this will bring), clients will be considering how their requirements will be met during an extreme period of transition and transformation.” How is the rest of the agency world affected? For one, it will most likely set off a chain reaction of M&A, because no other holding company can stay put as they are. “I expect to see more M&A activity on the back of this deal,” said Kangisser. “It’s easy to forget there are a number of very well funded, and highly acquisitive challenger groups who will look to fill this vacuum and provide clients with greater optionality.” “Start looking at all these other combinations,” said another high-level agency executive who declined to speak on the record. “The other guys are going to have to do something. I think this is the starting gun for major, major consolidation.” Every source reached for this story had their own scenario that could unfold. WPP, which has just been leapfrogged in size and scale, has long been the subject of breakup rumors. Havas just got spun out by parent company Vivendi, making it easier to pick by the likes of, say, Accenture or Dentsu. And Publicis, which analysts see as neck and neck with Omnicom in its success in the marketplace, isn’t likely to be left in the dust, despite already having acquired Influential and Mars United Commerce earlier this year. Nor should Omnicom itself be precluded from other purchases. Wren said the the $3 billion in cash flow would allow the company to continue to be acquisitive. For independents who have staked their claim to being the antidote to the holdco system and process, Christmas seemingly has come early. The deal “provides the independents the room to be able to articulate their propositions,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester. “Their counterpoint is skill, and this just helps frame their proposition of being able to balance the buying scale that they’re accumulating with the performance scale that they’ve developed.” And how will clients feel about this? Amazon just left IPG and gave some of its media business to Omnicom. Will this stir up unhappiness? Wren and Krakowsky poo-poo’d any notion that clients will have a problem with the acquisition. Jay Wilson, an analyst at Gartner, noted that the size of client will impact how much they’re affected. “It’s unlikely any single client will see an immediate impact on its relationship with existing IPG or Omnicom agencies, and those with large relationships at a holding company level will probably see the slowest transition — for example to a new hold-co wide data spine like IPG’s Acxiom,” said Wilson. “Clients of single agencies within these networks may be the first affected, if and when the new organization decides to merge individual agencies, as many hold co’s have been doing in recent years.” The acquisition is expected to yield $750 million in annual cost synergies within two years. Omnicom CEO John Wren and IPG CEO Philippe Krakowsky said the plan is to pool resources for bigger AI investments. Mosaic Media CEO Mary Ann Pruitt believes in the “great equalizer” of programmatic marketplaces, which to her have empowered independents to compete with holding companies on a level they never have before.

Title: Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview:
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-3761136

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Title: Computer science grads say the job market is rough. Some are opting for a 'panic' master's degree instead.

A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

Title: What We Got Right And Wrong In Our 2024 AI Predictions

We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.

Title: Trying new social media tactics to stand out in ‘brutal’ job market

From cash rewards to “desperate” banners, more job seekers are getting creative to land their next employment. SAN FRANCISCO — Job hunting for Nadeera Waduwara Kankanamalage has been nothing short of frustrating over the past two years. So a week before Thanksgiving, the 32-year-old Austin resident took an unlikely approach to landing a new tech gig: He went on LinkedIn offering a $3,000 reward to anyone who connects him to his next job. Kankanamalage’s written plea in his post sums up what many job seekers are experiencing right now: The market is “brutal” and the number of rejections are “a gut punch.” “It’s a whatever-it-takes mentality,” he said in an interview with the Washington Post. “Hopefully it’s a good signal for a potential employer that I’m proactive, and I’m trying to solve this problem in a creative way.” Exasperated by too much competition, no return communications, and automated rejection letters, job seekers are getting creative on social media to get a foot in the door. Many of them have spent months looking for roles, applying to hundreds of openings and turning to social media with seemingly nothing to lose. Some are offering rewards for job leads, tagging employers in their posts in the hopes of getting a comment, and getting vulnerable with videos and banners that say they are “desperate” for work. Their approaches represent a marked shift from how people used to handle layoffs and employment. That shift “might be a by-product of people’s greater willingness to be open,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. “Not too long ago, people would’ve been mortified to say they were open to work.” Kankanamalage said he is trying different things to see “what sticks.” “I need to be creative in getting myself into the workforce again,” he said. While more people are using social media networks to amplify their job hunt, unemployment remains relatively low in the United States at 4.1 percent, just above the 54-year record low last year of 3.4%, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong labor market is expected to continue into next year under the new presidential administration, House predicts. Despite the strong labor market, some industries are experiencing substantial churn as they reconfigure their workforce to address evolving business needs like artificial intelligence, he added. The share of people who have been unemployed for six months or more is increasing, while many workers may be less likely to relocate due to low mortgage rates that they scored during the pandemic, he said. Some job seekers have taken to TikTok, shedding tears as they explain their layoffs and ask for help. Others are making creative videos to show their skills, or producing video resumés. Then there’s the multitude of people who are making their case on the professional networking platform LinkedIn. Laura Martyna, a recruiting and human resources professional, created a mini marketing campaign for herself on LinkedIn after being laid off in September. Even though the 43-year-old in Concord, N.C., has more than 15 years of experience, including at Amazon, she said she’s only landed two interviews out of hundreds of job applications. When her dream job at Eli Lilly opened, she listed the reasons the company should hire her. She tagged the company, as well as former colleagues and bosses, whom she asked to add comments to support her effort. She also tagged the hiring manager, who responded with appreciation for the enthusiasm. “I don’t know how else to get flashing lights to get attention,” Martyna said the day after she posted. “It’s worth a shot. Nothing else is working.” Days later, Martyna got an automated rejection letter. But shortly after, the hiring manager asked to set up a meeting to learn more about her. For Martyna, the post paid off. Other job seekers have tried to cast wide nets by using banners that border their LinkedIn profile pictures with the phrase Open to Work. It’s one of the most common banners used, but some who’ve added it complain that it lures scams and bots. As an alternative, some LinkedIn members created their own banners using words like motivated or excited instead. One banner, made by a designer out of Britain, briefly went viral a couple of months ago. It pulled no punches with one blunt word: desperate. Jordan Dye, a 27-year-old, who’s been trying to break into the cybersecurity industry, added it to his profile immediately after seeing it. “I saw an opportunity, took it and then it blew up way bigger than I thought,” said the Dallas resident, who previously had relatively few LinkedIn connections. “I have over 1,600 followers now.” Dye said his post explaining the banner got about a half-million views, connections, and a lot of discussion. But he didn’t hear from hiring managers. He later changed his banner to Dying, playing off his name and the widespread desperation in the market. Dye, who for now isn’t using either banner, estimated he’s applied to 4,500 jobs since June 2023. Another job seeker, Rita Williams, initially used the banner in solidarity with the “desperate” movement. But the 38-year-old, who’s seeking a job as a technical analyst for a social justice reform organization, still displays it after two months, eight interviews, and 500 applications. “It seems like it became an indicator of, ‘Wow this person has been through it,’” she said about the banner. “It generates interest, and people are kinder.” She said she’s also in the process of creating a nonprofit. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said. LinkedIn said people who use the Open to Work banner on average are 40% more likely to receive messages from recruiters and 20% more likely to receive messages from other members. To avoid scams, LinkedIn said job seekers should look for verification badges on job postings and profiles. Given LinkedIn’s easy-apply button, and generative AI, which can quickly tailor a resumé for a specific job, employers and recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of candidates. But two recruiters were mixed on whether social media posts are a reliable way to stand out in the candidate pool. “Some of them are entertaining, but I don’t know if I’d hire based off that,” said Mindy Totaro, a senior creative recruiter at staffing agency Aquent. “Do you understand the skills or is it about just trying to get someone to respond?” Instead, Totaro says job seekers should focus on building relationships with recruiters and hiring managers, even if they don’t pay off right away, and ensure that their resumé skills match the job. It’s also best to be among the first applicants because recruiters sometimes have just 24 hours to present top candidates. To see job postings faster, follow recruiters and employers on social media, she said. But Thomas Vick, a technology employment trends expert and regional president with recruiting firm Robert Half, said creative posts — when done right — may give job seekers a leg up. “Anything that differentiates you in a positive, productive manner, especially if you can highlight how it can be beneficial to the business … it certainly can help,” he said, adding that candidates should try to stand out. Some job seekers exhausted by the void of silence and repeated rejections are becoming brutally honest. Feeling invisible after hundreds of applications, Chuck Williams let his LinkedIn network know that he’s on the verge of losing his house. Williams, a 36-year-old husband and father of two in Richland, Wash., said he was laid off just two months after purchasing the house. Six months later, he made his vulnerable LinkedIn plea for leads. “I genuinely needed to be honest about where I’m at and what I feel,” he said. Since the post, he’s received at least 3,000 comments and messages, mostly from people facing similar struggles. The post hasn’t led to a job, but it did land him two interviews with hiring managers. The outpouring of support that came from that post taught Williams a lesson: “There isn’t a silver bullet here. But what I think resonates with people is honesty.”

Title: What Arm’s CEO makes of the Intel debacle

By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Arm CEO Rene Haas has a unique, bird’s eye view of the tech industry. His company’s chip designs are in the majority of devices you use on a daily basis, from your smartphone to your car. The SoftBank-backed company he leads is worth almost $150 billion, which is now considerably more than Intel. With the news earlier this week that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger “retired” and Intel is evaluating its options for a possible spinoff or outright sale, I wanted to hear what Haas thought should happen to his longtime frenemy. There were reports that he approached Intel about buying a big chunk of the company before Gelsinger was ousted. At the same time, Arm is also rumored to be eyeing an expansion into building its own chips and not just licensing its designs. Haas and I touched on all that and more in an exclusive interview earlier today, which will air in full on a future episode of Decoder. (You can listen to my episode about AI spending in the enterprise that just came out as well.) In the meantime, I wanted to give subscribers the first peek at the highlights from my conversation with Haas. The following interview has been edited and condensed: On what he makes of the Intel situation: As someone who has been in the industry my whole career, it is a little sad to see what’s happening… Intel is an innovation powerhouse. At the same time, you have to innovate in our industry. There are lots of tombstones of great tech companies that don’t reinvent themselves. I think Intel’s biggest dilemma is how to disassociate being either a vertical company or a fabless company, to oversimplify it. That is the fork in the road that they’ve faced for the last decade. Pat [Gelsinger] had a strategy that was very clear that vertical was the way to win. In my opinion, when he took that strategy on in 2021, that was not a three-year strategy. That was a five-to-10-year strategy. He’s gone and there’s a new CEO to be brought in and the decision has to be made. My personal bias says that vertical integration is a pretty powerful thing. If they could get that right, I think they would be in an amazing position. But the cost associated with it is so high that it may be too big of a hill to climb. I’m not going to comment on the rumors that we wanted to buy them. But I think, again, if you’re a vertically integrated company and the power of your strategy is in the fact that you have a product and you have fabs, inherently, you have a potential huge advantage in terms of cost versus the competition. When Pat was the CEO, I did tell him more than once, “You ought to license Arm because if you’ve got your own fabs, fabs are all about volume and we can provide volume.” I wasn’t successful in convincing him to do that. On the rumors that Arm will build its own AI chips: If you’re defining a computer architecture and you’re building the future of computing, one of the things you need to be very mindful of is that link between hardware and software in terms of really understanding where the tradeoffs are being made, where the observations are being made, what are the ultimate benefits to consumers from a chip that has that type of integration. That is easier to do if you’re building something than if you’re licensing IP… If you’re building something, you’re much closer to that interlock, and you have a much better perspective in terms of the design tradeoffs to make. So, if we were to do something, that would be one of the reasons. On Arm’s ongoing lawsuit with Qualcomm: The current update is that it plans to go to trial on December 16th, which isn’t very far away. I can appreciate — because we talk to investors and partners — that what they hate the most is uncertainty. But on the flip side, I would say the principles as to why we filed the claim are unchanged. On Sam Altman’s prediction that AGI will arrive in 2025: I know he has his own definitions for AGI and his reasons for those definitions. I don’t subscribe so much to what is AGI versus ASI [artificial superintelligence]. I think more around when these AI agents start to think and reason and invent. To me, that is a bit of a “cross the Rubicon” moment… If you would have asked me this question a year ago, I would have said it’s quite a ways away. You ask that question now, [and] I say it is much closer. On David Sacks being named President-elect Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar: Kudos to him. I think that’s a pretty good thing. It’s quite fascinating that if you go back eight years to Trump 1.0, in terms of where we were in December as he was starting to fill out his Cabinet choices and appointees, it was a bit chaotic. At the same time, there wasn’t a lot of representation from the tech world. This time around, whether it’s Elon [Musk], whether it’s David [Sacks], whether it’s Vivek [Ramaswamy] — I know Larry Ellison has been very, very involved in terms of discussions with the administration — I think it’s a good thing. Having a seat at the table and having access to policy, I think, is really good. Big leadership changes hit Samsung Electronics this week, per an internal memo I’ve obtained. North America CEO KS Choi is out and has been replaced by Yoonie Joung, a 33-year company veteran. Dave Das now solely oversees the mobile business while former co-head Brent Yoo is heading to Brazil to run sales there. And Shane Higby now runs the following divisions: Home Entertainment, Display, and Digital Appliance. There were a bunch of other shuffles at the C-level, but those are the highlights. Samsung has been restructuring across the board for months now and did layoffs in Choi’s division at the end of September, so this week’s news isn’t really a surprise. Perhaps the company hasn’t announced this news externally yet because its Korean investors will be meeting in the US next week (a company rep didn’t have a comment by press time). “Our sales have been down, especially in consumer electronics,” one company insider tells me. “My guess is that we’re just not hitting our targets quarter-over-quarter and so he [Choi] had to go.” It was fascinating to be in the audience at the DealBook Summit for the first public interview Jeff Bezos has done in years. While I maybe should have been expecting it, I was still shocked at how much he gushed about Donald Trump and his archnemesis for Blue Origin, Elon Musk. Another part of the interview that stood out was when Bezos said he is spending a lot of time at Amazon, “95-percent” of which is focused on AI. This week, Amazon announced its Nova family of foundational AI models at AWS re:Invent — a project I first scooped in this newsletter earlier this year. Amazon is obviously still playing catch-up in the AI race, but it seems to have closed meaningful ground with Nova. If anything, this week shows how quickly the AI race is still shifting. It feels like any of the big players could leap ahead at any moment. Even if you’re an AI skeptic, that’s pretty exciting.

Title: The Concord episode of Secret Level is like a message from a ghost whose unfinished business is creating a global multimedia franchise

The defunct multiplayer shooter speaks from the afterlife in Amazon's upcoming videogame-themed anthology series. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Sometime before Sony hero shooter Concord released, before it was even fully revealed to the public, the producers of Amazon TV series Secret Level—a collection of animated videogame shorts premiering on Prime Video on December 10—started working on an episode based on the game. They didn't know that the short sci-fi tale they were animating would become a message from beyond the grave. The episode, which I've seen in advance of the show's premiere, was supposed to come out in a world where Concord was, if not a Helldivers 2-level hit, a popular and well-liked game. In reality, Concord barely lasted a week. Sony quickly shut the competitive multiplayer game down due to lack of interest, and then shuttered developer Firewalk Studios, which it had acquired partway through Concord's development. I played Concord and I thought it was fun enough, and it was technically sound, but its Bungie-influenced arena shooter stylings just didn't draw a crowd, and neither did its all-in commitment to building a Guardians of the Galaxy-like sci-fi universe with weekly cutscenes. They were going to follow the exploits of a crew of Freegunners—Concord's name for its roguish space mercenaries—whose realistically-rendered faces were a little uncanny. The Secret Level episode portrays the most important moment in the history of the Freegunners, when a heroic crew of outlaws stole a map of navigation routes that allow free travel through the galaxy for enemies of The Guild, a powerful policing body. At the end of the short adventure, we jump to a space pub in the present of Concord's timeline, where the legendary story has just been retold. There, we glimpse the arm of one of Concord's mascots—Lennox, the green guy—and of course we're supposed to think, 'Hey, I know that guy!' But no one does know much about the character, outside of his creators. What we got of Concord's story from the first trailers and cutscenes tell us that he's a daredevil who really loves hot sauce, but there were supposed to have been over a dozen more in-game cinematics by now. The episode comes across like a transmission from a spirit that doesn't know it's dead yet, one that still believes everything went right for Concord and the new game studio. It's the 13th episode of the series—unlucky, eh?—and it'll drop on December 17, although I found its eerie context more notable than the short story itself. Concord is far from the only multiplayer game—or game in general—to struggle or crater this year, although it was the most dramatic impact event. We just learned that Ubisoft isn't going to keep trying to build an audience for free-to-play shooter XDefiant, and it's been an unprecedented year for studio closures and layoffs. More than 300 developers lost their jobs just this week, and thousands more jobs were cut this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for the rest of Secret Level, we watched and rated each episode and liked some of them, but on the whole, the animated shorts didn't charm us much. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League. Secret Level review: our take on every episode of Amazon's videogame anthology show The creators of Secret Level say Bandai Namco encouraged them to do 'whatever we want' with an iconic character: 'We would like audiences to wonder what the f**k they did with Pac-Man' First it was Counter-Strike, now it's GTA RP: Fortnite unveils LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, a 'social roleplay experience in the Lego Fortnite world' PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
