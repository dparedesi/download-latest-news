The Walt Disney Company saw its fair share of disasters in 2024, even as Hollywood’s biggest studio continued to wield enormous power across media and politics. Disney repeatedly attacked now-President-elect Donald Trump throughout the campaign cycle, resulting in a bad year for ABC News. The studio saw its biggest streaming show of the year flop with subscribers, yet another ominous sign for the Disney+ service. And Disney closed out the year with a major box-office bomb. For CEO Bob Iger, 2024 was something of a transition period as the company continued in recovery mode following two financially difficult years. Iger swung the ax yet again across multiple Disney properties, with layoffs at Pixar, ABC News, NatGeo, and more. Last year, Iger laid off 7,000 workers worldwide, or three percent of its workforce, as the company’s financials tanked. Disney can take solace in the success of its blockbuster sequels — Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine were the two top-grossing movies of the year. But for every Moana 2 that rakes in a fortune, Disney also lays a giant egg, further sullying the studio’s formerly sterling reputation. Here are Disney’s biggest disasters for 2024. The Acolyte With a budget that one estimate put at close to a quarter of a billion dollars, Disney’s latest Star Wars spin-off series aimed to be a streaming blockbuster that would help drive subscriptions. Instead, the series tanked with viewers and was canceled after just one season. Who’s to blame? Most critics pointed to its weak and pointless story, unengaging main actress Amandla Stenberg pointlessly playing two twins, and pointless virtue signaling (a coven of lesbian witches saying they are not welcome in the galaxy, the casting of a transgender actor in a supporting role, and showrunner Leslye Headland herself, who promoted the series as the “gayest Star Wars” ever). Disney+ Woes The Acolyte‘s failure is emblematic of the entire streaming service Disney+, whose original and exclusive content has not resulted in the market dominance Iger had hoped for. As the year drew to a close, headline after headline signaled trouble for the content platform. In September, Disney slashed prices for new subscribers to $1.99 a month, hoping to boost its Q4 numbers. This month, an ad industry expert reported that companies are pulling their dollars from Disney+ due to unimpressive subscriber numbers, and Disney was shut out on the streaming charts by Netflix, Amazon, Paramount+, and even Peacock. Mufasa: The Lion King In what was supposed to be a box-office slam dunk, this “live action” prequel to The Lion King opened to a hugely disappointing $35 million — way off from the already muted expectation of $50 million. The movie could still find its legs, but the opening was a catastrophe for Disney, which was hoping to turn The Lion King into its own movie franchise. ABC News The Disney-owned news network face-planted hard during the presidential campaign. First, debate anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis put their fingers on the scale in favor of Kamala Harris, resulting in a rigged match that was too obvious to ignore. Muir paid the price — his World News Tonight ratings tanked the week after the debate. Then, host George Stephanopoulos stepped in it when he defamed Trump on-air, resulting in a more than $15 million settlement. The Bob Iger wing of the Trump presidential library is going to look grand. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, Disney is readying to launch one of its biggest titles: Snow White, starring Rachel Zegler, opens in less than three months. In February, Pixar will release its first-ever TV series, Win or Lose. Both projects have made major changes to appeal more to non-woke audiences. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

Title: Big Tech’s H1B Arguments Aren’t Just FALSE… They’re Also Immoral.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/27/2024 10:11:47 PM PST by SoConPubbie A fierce debate has broken out between President-elect Donald J. Trump’s very recent tech industry supporters and his long-standing America First base. At the core of the disagreement is the subject of legal immigration—specifically, how Trump should handle so-called “high-skilled” foreign worker programs like the H1B visa.One of the staunchest proponents of expanding the labor pool in this way is billionaire Elon Musk. In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

You get these “Libertarian”. tech bros who think they have the absolute right to replace any American employee if they can find someone anywhere in the world who can more or less do the job and works cheaper. And the the same Globalist mentality pervades the corporate class especially of the Anglo-Sphere. The backlash in Canada has been such that Liberal Justin Trudeau has announced big changes to the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, with tighter qualifications, higher mandatory wage premiums. Canada is now positioned to the Right of the USA on foreign workers, and Trump needs to get on this. 11 posted on 12/28/2024 12:39:44 AM PST by Reverend Wright ( Everything touched by progressives, dies !)

I’ll tell you since a lot if you clearly haven’t noticed... Any mention of Big Med. It’s not just Big Tech hiring H1Bs, is it. So why no mention of what Big Med is doing? That omission is telling to my mind. Stop allowing yourselves to be suckered into an either/or argument meant to divide us. We hired Trump to do a job. Give him room to do it. 14 posted on 12/28/2024 12:57:22 AM PST by mewzilla (Swing away, Mr. President, swing away!) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. 15 posted on 12/28/2024 1:39:08 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: FLT-bird Interesting points.

Until this is fixed, we will continue to send our jobs to workers off-shore, and off-shore workers on-shore.I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments.

So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. 15 posted on 12/28/2024 1:39:08 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: FLT-bird Interesting points.

ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs.

That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well.

The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs.

That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy. BTTT The H-1b visa program is a corporate indentured servant program that locks in the visa worker into a seven year contract while the employer sponsors their green card. It undercuts American wages, increases prices, and transfers of wealth through welfare payments. I know many smart kids from America’s best universities. These kids have studied math, physics, and engineering to a one - they all have found their way into banking, finance and management consulting, These jobs pay much better, as they serve America’s financialized and debt-bloated economy.

I work with many young guys with IT degrees that can’t get an IT job and they end up in sales or service. Yet i see my company stand up multiple departments with H1B people from India that can barely speak English. Sad fact these companies don’t care to train our youth. “ I work with many young guys with IT degrees that can’t get an IT job and they end up in sales or service.

Title: Google CEO Pichai struggled to navigate a pressure-filled year

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Google’s blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google’s employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company’s workforce. “We’ve noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,” one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. “How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company’s success?” The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. “Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases” another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company’s vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday’s close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai’s vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai’s standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google’s grip on U.S. search. The company’s share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had “offended our users and shown bias,” according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. “We definitely messed up on the image generation,” Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. “It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.” The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google’s traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked “How many rocks should I eat each day,” the tool said, “According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.” AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren’t hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

Title: HHW Gaming Presents The 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up, Plus Our Pick For Game of The Year

Source: Ubisoft Montpellier / Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown / 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up 2024 has come to a quick end. It has been a rollercoaster of year in video games; we break down the good, bad, and ugly in our wrap-up. 2023 was a year to remember, thanks to releases like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more, but don’t get it twisted. 2024 was no pushover due to so many solid releases. There was also some shaky news in the gaming industry, and we will discuss all that and hand out our award for Game of the Year. So let’s wrap up 2024. Source: PlayStation / PS5 Pro Sony’s worst-kept secret, the PS5 Pro, finally arrived after a year and some change of speculation and information leaks. The reveal of Sony’s powerful console refresh landed with a thud with news of the console’s $700 price tag, and that’s without a stand and disc drive because both accessories are optional, leaving many asking, did play have limits? Many then asked if this console was even necessary, despite the company knowingly marketing it to a more niche gamer who prioritizes graphics and frame rates. The consensus on the console at the end of the day was that it provides players with a significant boost in performance and fidelity, but it’s not something you need to rush out and buy. We shall see how the PS5 Pro fares in 2025 and if it was genuinely worth Sony even making it. Our prediction: we expect it to fare well in the new year as developers focus more on the PS5 and Pro models and no longer have to wor optimizing games for the PS4. Source: Bernard Smalls / iOne Digital / HHW Gaming / PS Portal / PlayStation The PS Portal was a big surprise win for Sony. When it was first revealed, the immediate question was, why? It didn’t run natively, had no Bluetooth capability, and was essentially just a companion accessory for the PS5 console, only working off the console’s Remote Play feature. When news of the device started circulating back in 2023, and photos began hitting the web, we immediately felt that Project Q, as it was called at the time, was Sony’s way of testing if they should get back in the still hot handheld market, Nintendo very much dominates that. That turned out to be the case, with PlayStation boss Hideaki Nishino saying that the PS Portal sales were a “huge success” story for the company and adding that the device would continue to “evolve.” With the addition of Cloud Streaming (Beta), we have seen signs of Sony actively developing a native handheld device that will not require you to be tethered to your PS5 console. Sony isn’t alone; Xbox is also working on a handheld device but has yet to pull the lid off what has come up with. Keeping it a buck, if you have been on the fence about the PS Portal, now is a better time than any to consider getting yourself one; this gamer truly appreciates how clutch it is when being in front of the television and console is not an option. Just make sure that the internet and Wi-Fi are up to snuff. Source: Xbox / Xbox Gaming x Amazon Fire TV As we approached the end of the year, Microsoft made its plans for the future abundantly clear: almost all of your devices, not just the black box, are Xboxes. Since Xbox’s mission was clear after its shaky start following the Activision /Blizzard/King acquisition, it was able to regroup after its epic failures. Desperate for wins, Xbox finally got some, but not the conventional way. Instead, they released console exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment, followed by Sea of Thieves and Grounded on the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. These titles became best sellers in the PlayStation Store despite lackluster console sales. The highly anticipated Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade II, another technical masterpiece from Xbox studio Ninja Theory, was also released in 2024. However, it was also a polarizing game, with critics divided on whether it was worth the wait and whether it should have been considered a big exclusive for the Xbox Series X. Two massive wins for Team Green had to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to Xbox Game Pass to high praise. 2025 can be an interesting year for Xbox. Yes, many people are still skeptical about the company’s plans moving forward, mainly because they feel their loyalty has been taken for granted. Still, Xbox was losing, and they realized they needed to pivot. They still have their mid-level refresh console, codenamed Brooklin, the aforementioned native handheld in the works, and plenty of games in the pipeline, so we are still very intrigued. Source: Microsoft / Xbox Yes, it was cool to discuss all of the good things that happened in 2024, but we would not be honest if we didn’t mention the layoffs and the shuttering of numerous video game studios. At the beginning of the year, Microsoft announced it was laying off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees. This was not a good look for a company that had just spent $69 billion to acquire the Call of Duty developer. It continued the trend from 2023 when an estimated 10,500 game industry workers lost their jobs. Xbox also shuttered four of its studios: Tango Gameworks, which delivered the surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush; Redfall developer Arkane Austin; Alpha Dog; and Roundhouse. PlayStation also got in on the act as well, laying off 900 employees in February 2024 and suffering what the biggest miss of the year with its hero shooter, Concord, which never really got to see the light of day following a very poor reception and eventually shuttering the studio behind it, Firewalk was was. Gaming journalism also suffered after Gamestop shut down Game Informer magazine after 33 glorious years and many fire cover stories and exclusives. Gamestop didn’t even give the magazine the proper sendoff it deserved, opting for a lame landing page when you visit the now-defunct publications landing page. What a sad way for the iconic magazine to end. Former Game Informer employees discuss the unceremonious end on the FPS Podcast below. Source: Ubisoft / The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown In a year that saw plenty of bangers like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Astro Bot, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Helldivers II, Tekken 8, and more, there can only be one HHW Gaming Game of The Year. But determining which game would win our prestigious Game of the Year award wasn’t hard. The winner is Ubisoft Montpellier’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. There was no doubt that The Lost Crown was a special title from the first time we booted it up in January. In our review of the game, our resident gamer, Beanz, wrote: The Last Crown is a masterpiece; I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with this game. The combat is snappy and fun to use thanks to the combo system and Sargon’s acquired abilities, allowing for stylish, fast gameplay. While Ubisoft Montreal is hard at work on the Sands of Time remake, Montpellier’s The Lost Crown is not just a placeholder; it’s the perfect pivot for the franchise, putting it on a refreshing path to newfound greatness. Sadly, Sargon’s journey will likely not continue because Ubisoft disbanded the Montpellier team, leaving the game in limbo. This development is disheartening because Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was a unique game with the potential to become a new hit chapter in the iconic video game franchise. We will keep our fingers crossed that Ubisoft will recognize the error of its ways with The Lost Crown, but we’re not holding our breath. Well, that’s it for 2024, onward to 2025. Keep it locked on HHW Gaming for the games we are looking forward to in 2025, and hit the gallery below for other games we thought were bangers in 2024.

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024. After Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of "Wicked" actors, where one, labeled "execs" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled "Gemini" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as "users." A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. "Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here," the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more "cost efficiencies" across the company in order to invest more in AI.

"Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do," one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. "Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people," another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down.

Title: Turning Chaos Into Opportunity: Navigating The QA Industry's New Reality

Ruslan Desyatnikov is Founder and CEO of QA Mentor, Inc., an independent software-testing company headquartered in New York. As the tech sector faces unprecedented upheaval and widespread layoffs, the QA industry is feeling the impact, grappling with new uncertainties. This shifting landscape presents significant challenges that demand our attention. It’s time to confront how these changes are reshaping the world of quality assurance and what it means for professionals in the field. From 2022 to 2023, major tech firms carried out significant job layoffs. Amazon let go of 27,000 workers, Meta dismissed 21,000 and Microsoft laid off 10,000. These figures have only grown as we moved into 2024, as over 500 tech companies have made job cuts, resulting in over 100,000 employees losing their jobs since the start of this year. This is a world away from 2020-2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation that led to heightened demand for tech products and services, such as remote work tools, e-commerce platforms and digital entertainment. During this period, tech companies saw stock prices soar on investor optimism in a pandemic-changed world. Global central banks kept interest rates low to aid economic recovery, allowing tech firms affordable borrowing for growth. Government stimulus and aid bolstered businesses, including tech, amid pandemic uncertainties. As the global economy faced renewed challenges around 2022, including rising inflation and interest rates, tech giants shifted gears from their aggressive hiring stance of 2020-2021. Now, they're cutting back on hiring and implementing layoffs to ensure financial stability post-pandemic. This abrupt change is reshaping employees' career trajectories from optimism to uncertainty almost overnight. In this industry upheaval, the QA sector must seize the opportunity to leverage automation and AI to stay competitive. As AI testing solutions advance, QA professionals need AI tools to remain marketable. By integrating AI, companies can: • Optimize efficiency with AI. AI-driven tools quickly spot patterns and anomalies often missed by traditional methods, streamlining testing, cutting manual work and boosting productivity. AI also prioritizes test cases based on data, ensuring focus on critical areas. • Control costs through predictive AI. AI reduces manual labor by predicting defects early, minimizing rework and errors. AI-driven resource management enhances efficiency and keeps budgets lean. • Enhance human resource allocation.

Title: Valve makes more money per employee than Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix combined

The big picture: Valve is one of the most important and influential companies in the PC gaming market. It's also one of the most unique due to its private nature and unusually small workforce relative to its impact and competitors. A recent analysis of data uncovered through an ongoing lawsuit against the company highlights how Valve starkly contrasts with the world's biggest tech giants. A Valve employee recently provided PC Gamer with a rough calculation of the company's per-employee income, revealing that Valve generates more money per person than several of the world's largest companies. While the data is a few years old and doesn't account for some significant recent trends in the tech sector, Valve's ranking in this metric likely hasn't shifted much over that time. Exact figures for Valve's per-hour and per-employee net income remain redacted. However, a chart from 2018 confirms that Valve's per-employee income exceeded that of companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon. Click to enlarge Facebook's second-place ranking of $780,400 per employee – or $89 per hour – likely stands far ahead of competitors such as Apple and Microsoft because Facebook employs just under 70,000 employees compared to the two PC giants, which each have workforces over twice that number. By contrast, Amazon, with a headcount of over 1.5 million, earned only around $15,892 per employee, or $1.81 per hour. Filings from a 2021 antitrust lawsuit brought by Wolfire Games revealed that Valve employed just 336 people at the time – fewer than the development team for Baldur's Gate 3. Despite this relatively tiny workforce, Valve oversees Steam, which hosts nearly 40 million daily users and dominates the PC game sales market. Wolfire cited this discrepancy as evidence that Steam's 30 percent revenue commission for most titles is unjustified. Notably, the available data doesn't reflect the impact of the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming PC, which launched in 2022. It's unclear to what extent Valve hired or outsourced additional staff for the device's development and production, but it's unlikely the company expanded its workforce anywhere near the scale of other tech giants. Valve would likely remain at the top of a per-employee income ranking based on current data. However, recent trends such as widespread layoffs and the ongoing AI boom could shift the standings for other companies. It would also be intriguing to see whether Nvidia has entered the ranking, as the AI explosion has propelled its profits to new heights, recently making it the newest member of the $3 trillion club.

Title: The biggest gaming controversies of 2024

Layoffs, politics, and the culture wars dominated 2024, but there were plenty of regular, everyday goofs, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. 2024 was a big year for gaming, and so naturally it was also a big year for gaming-related controversies. While hand-wringing over fears that "videogames cause violence" seems to have subsided, at least for now, political and culture wars nonsense is more pronounced than ever. The videogame industry itself, meanwhile, continued to suffer decimation as funding dried up and executives who overplayed their hands during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic slashed headcounts in the name of "sustainability." There's no other way to put it: It got ugly out there. Of course, there were plenty of conventional fumbles too: Dissembling, dishonesty, and some straight-up bad calls provided plenty of "things that actually happened" for gamers to be unhappy about. From Facebook rejecting ads for board games to a weird cat game accused of being built with AI, here's our roundup of the year's biggest lowlights. Our face: 😕 What happened: When board game publisher Fort Circle attempted to purchase Facebook ads for a new edition of Votes for Women, a board game about the women's suffrage movement in the US, it received an unexpected surprise: Facebook said no. The problem, according to an automated response provided by Facebook to the publisher, is that the ad "mentions politicians or is about sensitive social issues that could influence public opinion, how people vote and may impact the outcome of an election or pending legislation." The outcome: You might think that such patent stupidity is the result of a bad algorithm making bad decisions, as they do, and you'd be correct. But when Fort Circle requested a review of the ruling, that too was rejected. Not being able to run ads had a material impact on the Votes for Women crowdfunding campaign—"Most Kickstarter creators will tell you that Facebook advertising is a crucial piece of the crowdfunding puzzle," Fort Circle founder Kevin Bertram said at the time—but more broadly it points to a pretty serious failure in Facebook's review process. Our face: 😡 What happened: In March, a little-known company called Sweet Baby Inc was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by "anti-woke" gamers outraged by, as one put it, the narrative consultants' promulgation of "ideological worldviews that I believe have taken hold of the Western world, media, and gaming as a whole." Which is of course nonsense: The company is contracted by developers who want to improve pre-existing elements of their games, and it has absolutely no power to force anyone to do anything—least of all make wholesale changes to their projects to enforce some sort of imagined "race and identity group quota." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The outcome: As ridiculous as it sounds (and is), the furor was (and is) real. A Steam curator group dedicated to "detecting" the presence of Sweet Baby Inc in games has now swollen to more than 460,000 followers, and the company was forced to lock its social media accounts following a torrent of abuse. Our face: 🤨 What happened: The Fallout TV show on Amazon was a hit, but it made some Fallout die-hards angry because of a perceived lack of faith to the lore. PC Gamer's Chris Livingston broke the whole thing down in detail, but the short version is that aggrieved fans believed Bethesda was using the Amazon show to erase Fallout: New Vegas—a fan-favorite in the series that was notably not developed by Bethesda, but by Obsidian—from the timeline. The outcome: Reactions to the conspiracy theory varied: Showrunner Graham Wagner said the wasteland isn't static and sometimes things happen, New Vegas lead designer Josh Sawyer understands the annoyance but really doesn't give a shit, and Todd Howard, the man currently atop the Fallout creative mountain, expressed mild exasperation about the whole thing, promising that "New Vegas is a very, very important game" to Bethesda. Bottom line? Everyone needs to simmer down. Our face: 🤔 What happened: Battlestate Games shot itself in the foot real good in April with the release of a $250 Unheard Edition of the game that included, among other things, access to co-op PvE—a mode that owners of other editions would have to pay to play. What really stuck in the community's craw, though, was a previously-released $150 Edge of Darkness edition that promised "free access to all subsequent DLCs," but that did not offer access to the new mode. Battlestate argued that the PvE mode was not DLC but a "unique feature of the new game," and thus didn't count. That went over about as well as you'd expect—extremely not well, to be clear—and Battlestate made the situation worse by dicking around with half-baked sops. It eventually offered six months of co-op play for free, but not until some future date because the servers don't have the capacity to handle everyone; on top of that, people who bought the $250 edition were promised priority matchmaking, meaning everyone else would be stuck in longer queues. They were also given access to in-game items protecting them from scavs and enabling more and better gear to be carried, conferring a distinct advantage over others, including those who bought the previously-prized $150 version. The outcome: As PC Gamer's Jake Tucker said, Battlestate "wiped out years of goodwill in one catastrophic week," but somehow it wasn't quite finished stepping on the Lego it'd dumped on the floor. After initially offering owners of the Edge of Darkness edition of Escape from Tarkov an option to upgrade to the newer release for $100 (what a deal), Battlestate reduced the upgrade price to $50; players who had already forked over $100 for the upgrade were offered $50 in "compensation," in the form of a single-use Escape from Tarkov voucher. Our face: 😣 What happened: Not content to sit quietly on the sidelines and watch Battlestate blow years of goodwill to smithereens with unforced errors, Bethesda said "hold my beer" and rolled out a "next-gen" patch for Fallout 4 that PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield described as nothing short of "calamitous." It wasn't just that the update changed so little, it actually made things worse: The added ultrawide support borked the UI, modded saves wouldn't load, and frame rate was still capped at 60. Adding insult to injury, the update rolled out on the heels of the hit Fallout TV show on Amazon, which had sparked a whole new wave of interest in and excitement for the game series, and the mod team behind Fallout London had to delay the total conversion's release to be sure it'd be compatible with the new version. The outcome: An update to the update rolled out a few weeks later, correcting a few issues but leaving the biggest problems for modders to fix. Many of them recommended the simplest fix of all: Use the Fallout 4 Downgrader tool to revert the game to a pre-"next gen" state and be happy with a game that works like it's supposed to. For the record, Fallout 4's next-gen patch hasn't been updated since. Our face: 😵 What happened: The Kerbal Space Program 2 controversy actually kicked off in early 2023 with a catastrophic early access launch, but it took a weird, drawn-out twist in 2024. In May, it was reported that KSP2 developer Intercept Games, along with Rollerdrome studio Roll7, were being closed as part of sweeping layoffs at parent company Take-Two Interactive. But shortly after that report, the Kerbal Space Program X account piped up, saying, "We're still hard at work on KSP2. We'll talk more when we can." Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick threw more confusion on the fire a couple weeks later, saying the closure report wasn't true: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear." Zelnick insisted he wasn't trying to be "cute or difficult" about the situation, but yeah, he was being kind of cute and difficult. Not too long after that, Intercept employees confirmed that large numbers of people at the studio, and possibly the entire team, was being laid off. The outcome: In November, Take-Two sold its Private Division publishing label to an unnamed buyer, and at the same time finally confirmed that Intercept and Roll7 had in fact been closed at some point prior to the sale. Take-Two still hasn't explained what happened between 'we haven't closed the studio' and 'the studio is closed.' As for Kerbal Space Program 2, it appears to be cooked: The KSP X account hasn't posted since the "still hard at work" promise in May, and the most recent game update—a relatively small bug-fix patch—went live in June. The game currently has a "mostly negative" overall user rating on Steam, and a concurrent player count that hovers around 100. Our face: 😐 What happened: Arrowhead's fascism-is-fun shooter Helldivers 2 was on a monster roll following its launch in February, but ran face-first into a concrete wall in May when Sony, the game's publisher, announced that players on Steam would be required to have a PlayStation Network account if they wanted to keep playing. That was the plan from the start, but the requirement was initially put on hold because of server issues when the game first went live. That didn't mollify players, who came hard with the time-honored tradition of a review-bombing: More than 220,000 negative reviews flooded into Steam, dragging Helldivers 2's "overwhelmingly positive" rating to "mixed." Sony stood its ground briefly but eventually backed down, leaving Arrowhead to clean up the mess. The outcome: An influx of positive reviews followed in the wake of Operation Cleanup, but like grassy fields in France that remain pockmarked with shell craters, evidence of the battle remains in the game's "mostly positive" rating on Steam: Good, but nowhere near what it used to be. And despite the debacle, Sony isn't giving up on the PSN account requirement on PC: President Hiroki Totoki said in November that linked accounts are necessary so people can "safely" play its games. Our face: 😬 What happened: Things went sideways in a hurry for Tekken pro Kim "JDCR" Hyun-jin, who was about to claim victory against opponent Alexandra "AK" Laverez at Dreamhack Dallas when his controller crapped out, eventually determined to be the result of someone who was previously connected to the setup turning their controller on. That forced a redo of the match, and that didn't go over well: As PC Gamer's resident fighting game pro Mollie Taylor recounted, "Twitch chat can be seen saying things like 'JDCR won that fair and square,' 'JDCR ALREADY WON,' 'JDCR got screwed,' and 'Jdcr won. This is rigged'." When the do-over match eventually went ahead, AK—who was undoubtedly going to lose prior to the technical trouble—came out on top, and the reaction was predictable. AK received "a heaping of rather undue hate," Taylor wrote: Some said he should have forfeited the match, others went so far as to claim that he'd intentionally sabotaged JDCR's controller connection in order to avoid a loss. The outcome: JDCR ultimately finished ninth in the tournament, just missing out on a top-eight finish that would have earned him a qualifying position at the Esports World Cup. DreamHack founder Alex Jebailey said on Twitter that he felt "incredibly sorry for what happened" and that he'd help JDCR attend future qualifiers for another World Cup shot. But, he added, "the amount of death threats and crazy things being said to me are pretty horrendous." Our face: 🤠 What happened: Starfield was a perfectly fine Bethesda RPG, but didn't quite live up to the pre-release hype. The mood among players soured further as months went by with minimal support, and the launch of the Starfield Creation Kit in June did not improve things. The big problem was the release of a single Trackers Alliance mission called The Vulture that cost $7, which thanks to the magic of Starfield Creation Credits bundle pricing was in reality $10. Unhappy players likened the DLC to Oblivion's infamous Horse Armor, the 2006 add-on that heralded the era of cosmetic microtransactions. The outcome: Horse Armor won in 2006, and despite the widespread early upset it looks like The Vulture did too: In response to the backlash, Todd Howard said "we hear the feedback" (ie., a small review bombing campaign on Steam) but Bethesda hasn't budget on the price, and it remains among the most popular of more than 2,700 Starfield creations. Our face: 🤬 What happened: Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a nexus of anti-woke gamer upset since revealing Yasuke, one of its two protagonists. Yasuke is a real-life historical figure who lived in Japan in the 16th century and eventually became an attendant of Oda Nobunaga. He's an ideal fit for an Assassin's Creed character, but he's also Black, and that caused great distress among certain corners of the gaming world, who very suddenly discovered a new commitment to historical authenticity (it's widely believed Yasuke served as a samurai, but not known for certain) and felt that featuring him instead of a "real" Japanese samurai was disrespectful to Japan. X owner Elon Musk amplified that sentiment in May, replying to a complaint about the game posted on his platform that "DEI kills art." Ubisoft's ham-fisted efforts to address what it apparently imagined were good-faith concerns about the game, meanwhile, only made the whole situation worse. It got to the point where even Reddit was sick of dealing with it. Other, more self-inflicted problems cropped up over the second half of the year. In July, Ubisoft apologized for using a real-life reenactment group's flag in Assassin's Creed Shadows concept art without permission, and in October the maker of a collectible said it would be redesigned following complaints that it bore a striking resemblance to the one-legged torii standing outside the Sannō Shrine, a remnant of the 1945 nuclear attack on the city of Nagasaki. Frankly, though, I don't think either issue would have attracted nearly as much attention had the anger pump not already been primed by the inclusion of Yasuke. The outcome: Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed in September to February 14, 2025, so we're still waiting to see how that works out, but it's been interesting watching Ubisoft grapple with the blowback. There seems to be confusion, or perhaps conflict, on how best to approach it: Executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said in June that Musk was "feeding hatred," but in September, after announcing the delay, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot took pains to reassure everyone that "our goal is not to push any specific agenda" with games. But Coté is having none of that, saying more forcefully in November that some of Assassin's Creed Shadows' loudest critics post "lies, half truths and personal attacks online," and that "when we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away." Our face: 🤢 What happened: Guy Beahm, better known online as the streamer Dr Disrespect, was banned from Twitch for life in 2020. But the reason for his ouster remained a secret until June 2024, when a former Twitch employee alleged that Beahm was shown the door because he was caught "sexting a minor" through Twitch's Whispers messaging system. A few days later, Beahm acknowledged exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 "that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," but insisted that "nothing illegal happened" and that he never faced criminal charges as a result of his actions. The outcome: The fallout was immediate and severe. Beahm was fired by Midnight Society, the game studio he co-founded in 2021, when the allegations first came to light; shortly after his public admission, 2K Games, Turtle Beach, the NFL, and YouTube also cut ties with the streamer. Our face: 😧 What happened: Destiny 2 studio Bungie laid off 220 employees in July, less than a year after an October 2023 layoff that saw a number of long-time and high-profile staffers put out of work. What really pissed people off, though, were claims that Bungie CEO Pete Parsons had spent more than $2.4 million on vintage cars over the two years leading up to the layoffs. Parson's money to spend, yes, and not a huge amount of it compared to the cash Destiny 2 has hoovered in over the years, but as PC Gamer's Harvey Randall put it, "Isn't it weird that he has so much of it while his now-former employees face anxiety over their basic living expenses?" Some former Bungie employees sure thought so. The reaction to Parsons' vehicular habits was no doubt amplified to some extent by his public performance in the wake of those October 2023 layoffs, in which he did his best to present himself as an innocent bystander rather than a well-paid, still-employed studio chief. As one person said in response to Parsons' post about those layoffs on X, "Your senior social lead probably would have recommended against this post, which you would have known had you not let them go." The outcome: Destiny 2 is still grinding along, but the road ahead hasn't gotten any smoother. In October, Sony carved off more of Bungie, making its Creative Studios arm a part of PlayStation Studios, and in December former Destiny 2 and Marathon director Christopher Barrett, who was fired in April over allegations of inappropriate behavior with female employees, sued the company for $200 million, saying Bungie "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating they had 'investigated' Barrett and 'found' he had engaged in sexual misconduct." Our face: 😮 What happened: Amina Abakarova, a 40 year-old chess player from the Russian Republic of Dagestan, was scheduled to play Umayganat Osmanova, a 30 year-old longtime rival who had beaten Abakarova into second place in a tournament the week prior. Not wanting to risk a second consecutive L, Abakarova decided to up her game by smearing liquid mercury all over the chess board and pieces they were meant to use. Mercury is of course very poisonous, and Osmanova began complaining that she was unwell, nauseous and dizzy around half an hour after the game began. Doctors were called in, and were fortunately able to prevent her from succumbing to the poison. The outcome: Abakarova might be a really good chess player, but she's not much of a criminal mastermind. She applied the poison in full view of security cameras, and was thus quickly busted by police. She reportedly copped to the whole thing, not because she wanted to win the match but just because she really doesn't like Osmanova, and now she's facing up to three years in prison and a lifetime ban from competitive chess play. It may not seem like a world-shattering controversy from our videogame-centric perspective, but it was a very big deal in the world of chess: Malcolm Pein of the English Chess Federation said he'd "never seen anything like this before," adding that it was "the first recorded case of somebody using a toxic substance, to my knowledge, in the history of the game of chess." Our face: 😒 What happened: Black Myth: Wukong is a good game and a major success, but it's also become a pivot point in the culture wars thanks to a 2023 IGN report on the long history of sexism at developer Game Science. The issue was put back under the spotlight in August 2024 when the studio sent out streaming guidelines just ahead of Black Myth: Wukong's release forbidding, among other things, "feminist propaganda" during streams. Naturally, the usual parts of the Twittersphere were thrilled to see a developer being so "based," especially since Black Myth: Wukong was a hit, proof positive that 'real gamers' don't want politics in their videogames, or somesuch. Others viewed the whole thing more as just strange and a little creepy. The outcome: Game Science has steadfastly refused to even acknowledge the issue: On multiple occasions, both before and after the streamer guidelines came to light, the studio has kept its head down and refused to comment on the controversy. Which may be a comment in itself: As PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon wrote, "It's hard not to read the silence as a sign that Game Science feels it has nothing to apologize for." Our face: 😶 What happened: Mega-YouTuber Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson had a good first-half in 2024, with his main account becoming the most-subscribed channel on the platform in June, but a very bad second half, as his media empire became embroiled in multiple scandals. Longtime collaborator Ava Kris Tyson was accused of grooming a 14-year-old fan after an exchange of inappropriate messages came to light, and while Donaldson quickly cut ties with Tyson, more trouble followed. Contestants in his Beast Games competition, a real-life Squid Games knockoff, complained of poor treatment, and former employees came forward to say some elements of his videos were either faked or rigged—and that they'd been mistreated themselves. The outcome: Rather than issuing the standard mea culpa that so often comes in the wake of this sort of thing, Donaldson is trying to power through it, keeping his head down, his mouth shut, and the videos rolling. So far it seems to be working: His subscriber numbers continue to climb, and his videos are still attracting hundreds of millions of viewers. Our face: 🙄 What happened: Legendary game designer and bullshitter extraordinaire Peter Molyneux said in August that he's "coming home" to PC, which would've been exciting news in, say, 2006. But in 2024, the bloom is off the rose thanks to a long series of catastrophes including Curiosity, Godus and the follow-up Godus Wars, and Legacy, a blockchain-based business sim that raised a huge pile of money in pre-release land sales (although apparently not quite the $54 million claimed by some reports) and then immediately tanked. Which isn't to say Molyneux's new thing, the god game Masters of Albion, will necessarily be bad. If anything, it actually shows some real promise: Superficially, it looks a bit like Populous mashed up with Fable, and if Molyneux's 22cans studio can pull it off, that definitely might not suck. The outcome: Impossible to say at this point because nothing else has happened, but memories of the last decade-plus will not be forgotten, and that puts the whole thing in a deep hole right from the start. I hope he's able to climb out of it and clock us all in the head with one final, great triumph, but the days of granting Molyneux the benefit of the doubt are long over. Our face: 😢 What happened: The online shooter Concord was one of the biggest, most spectacular flameouts in videogame history: After sinking vast amounts of money into the project, including the outright purchase of developer Firewalk Studios in 2023, mixed user reviews and abysmally low player counts sealed its doom immediately. Some hoped Concord might get a second shot at life as a free-to-play game, but Sony shot down that proposition in October: Concord, like the proverbial parrot, is dead. The outcome: It was an ugly mess by any measure, but what was particularly notable in the wake of Concord's failure was the glee it prompted from some corners of the gaming world: Gloating, memes, and shared screenshots of the game's concurrent player count on Steam dominated the post-closure discourse. PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde said "the eagerness to grave dance on unpopular games has become a bad habit," and he's absolutely right. Concord was at best a perfectly fine shooter trying to break into a crowded genre where "perfectly fine" isn't nearly good enough, and there's plenty of space for analysis and discussion of how it all went so completely wrong. But cheering its loss—and the subsequent closure of Firewalk—does no one any good. Our face: 🤢🤢🤢 What happened: The Dr Disrespect comeback tour began in September with a 20-minute rant on his YouTube channel, in which he said his Twitch suspension was primarily the result of a conspiracy against him. But it didn't really kick into gear until October, when YouTube declined to remonetize his channel. In response, the streamer teased "something much, much bigger" in the works, which in November turned out to be a move to Rumble, the right-wing streaming platform that hosts the likes of Dan Bongino, Steven Crowder, Viva Frei, Russell Brand, The Quartering, and the Tate Brothers. The outcome: Well, Dr Disrespect is on Rumble now. The numbers aren't nearly the same at this point—he's currently at a little over 76,000 followers on Rumble, a small fraction of the 4.55 million he'd amassed on YouTube—but he's not just streaming there: His deal with the platform includes equity in the company, and he will also lead Rumble Gaming, its videogame-focused livestream category. Lest there be any doubt about his commitment to the cause, the move came a month after he announced a line of "Make Gaming Great Again" merchandise modeled after the campaign slogan of US president-elect Donald Trump. Our face: 😠 What happened: Under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, a major American non-profit that campaigns against antisemitism and promotes Zionism as a movement for "self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland," Twitch banned several Arab streamers in October over a TwitchCon panel that had occurred a month earlier. Panelists had put together a tier list ranking various streamers from "Arab" to "loves Sabra", an American and Israeli-owned hummus brand; Twitch partner and panel host Frogan said the panel was about "who has a habibi pass" (habibi is Arabic for "my love") but the ADL characterized it as "antisemitic vitriol." The ban came a week after Twitch suspended Asmongold for his racist tirade against Palestinians, and the discovery that Twitch had stopped signups with email verification from both Israel and Palestine for more than a year, which it said was done "to prevent uploads of graphic material" following the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023—a "temporary" measure it apparently forgot to reverse. The outcome: Following weeks of back-and-forth complaints of Islamophobia and antisemitism on the platform, Twitch rolled out a policy requiring a warning label for streams about vaguely-defined "politics and sensitive social issues," which included discussions about topics including "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration." Twitch modified the guidelines a few days later to remove LGBTQ+ references but the rules remained too vague to be useful in any meaningful way; days after that, again under pressure from the ADL, Twitch forbid the use of the word "Zionist" to "attack or demean" other people or groups, but said it could still be used in its political context. Our face: 🤡 What happened: X owner and soon-to-be co-president of the United States Elon Musk made the bizarre statement on his platform that "too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations," before promising that "xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!" The outcome: Setting aside the fact that making games is really hard and nobody knows what an "AI game studio" is beyond some imagined Star Trek-style fantasy that doesn't actually exist, the statement was especially strange coming from a man with whose net worth is counted in the hundreds of billions—he's literally the wealthiest man on the planet—and who heads up a number of pretty famous "massive corporations" of his own. The real motivation for Musk's promised move into the industry was revealed by a later tweet to be less about concerns over corporate ownership, and more about wanting games that "skip the woke lecture." The segment of the gaming community up in arms about "wokeness" in videogames was thrilled to see Musk wading into the fray, but there's been no more said about it since. Our face: 😔 What happened: Hardware maker NZXT came under fire in December for its Flex PC rental service, which a Gamers Nexus exposé called a "predatory, evil rental computer scam." Specific complaints included allegations that NZXT would sometimes swap out components in rented PCs with less powerful hardware, use seemingly false or misleading benchmarks, and lock rental customers into unfair contracts. The outcome: NZXT defended its practices in response, but acknowledged that it "messed up" on some points. It committed to greater clarity on various points of the program and an end to "influencer-led" advertising, and also spent a good chunk of text laying out the "use case" for the Flex rental program, which NZXT said "allows for flexibility and lower commitment than owning or financing a PC." The response did not calm the waters: A video of NZXT CEO Johnny Hou discussing the matter has received 331 likes on YouTube, and more than 6,400 dislikes. Our face: 🐱 What happened: Catly, a weird game about cats, dropped a reveal trailer at the 2024 Game Awards. Rather than being greeting with the presumably-expected "awww, they're so cute," though, the trailer sparked immediate speculation (and some straight-up accusations) that it was made with generative AI. The game itself, from the very little that could be seen of it, struck many as little more than an NFT showcase. Those concerns were heightened by reports that Kevin Yeung, the co-founder of developer SuperAuthenti, is also co-founder of TenthPlanet, a studio that definitely is (or at least was) working on blockchain projects. The outcome: SuperAuthenti has been oddly quiet about the whole thing, although it did eventually state that Catly does not use AI and has "zero blockchain technology." Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see: A post-announcement update to the Steam page provided a closer look at what the game is all about, but more details won't be revealed until sometime in 2025. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80. From there he graduated to the glory days of Sierra Online adventures and Microprose sims, ran a local BBS, learned how to build PCs, and developed a longstanding love of RPGs, immersive sims, and shooters. He began writing videogame news in 2007 for The Escapist and somehow managed to avoid getting fired until 2014, when he joined the storied ranks of PC Gamer. He covers all aspects of the industry, from new game announcements and patch notes to legal disputes, Twitch beefs, esports, and Henry Cavill. Lots of Henry Cavill.
