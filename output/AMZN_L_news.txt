A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

Title: Life after Google: 8 laid-off employees reflect on being let go, what they did next, and their advice for others

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

Title: What We Got Right And Wrong In Our 2024 AI Predictions

We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.

Title: Trying new social media tactics to stand out in ‘brutal’ job market

From cash rewards to “desperate” banners, more job seekers are getting creative to land their next employment. SAN FRANCISCO — Job hunting for Nadeera Waduwara Kankanamalage has been nothing short of frustrating over the past two years. So a week before Thanksgiving, the 32-year-old Austin resident took an unlikely approach to landing a new tech gig: He went on LinkedIn offering a $3,000 reward to anyone who connects him to his next job. Kankanamalage’s written plea in his post sums up what many job seekers are experiencing right now: The market is “brutal” and the number of rejections are “a gut punch.” “It’s a whatever-it-takes mentality,” he said in an interview with the Washington Post. “Hopefully it’s a good signal for a potential employer that I’m proactive, and I’m trying to solve this problem in a creative way.” Exasperated by too much competition, no return communications, and automated rejection letters, job seekers are getting creative on social media to get a foot in the door. Many of them have spent months looking for roles, applying to hundreds of openings and turning to social media with seemingly nothing to lose. Some are offering rewards for job leads, tagging employers in their posts in the hopes of getting a comment, and getting vulnerable with videos and banners that say they are “desperate” for work. Their approaches represent a marked shift from how people used to handle layoffs and employment. That shift “might be a by-product of people’s greater willingness to be open,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. “Not too long ago, people would’ve been mortified to say they were open to work.” Kankanamalage said he is trying different things to see “what sticks.” “I need to be creative in getting myself into the workforce again,” he said. While more people are using social media networks to amplify their job hunt, unemployment remains relatively low in the United States at 4.1 percent, just above the 54-year record low last year of 3.4%, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong labor market is expected to continue into next year under the new presidential administration, House predicts. Despite the strong labor market, some industries are experiencing substantial churn as they reconfigure their workforce to address evolving business needs like artificial intelligence, he added. The share of people who have been unemployed for six months or more is increasing, while many workers may be less likely to relocate due to low mortgage rates that they scored during the pandemic, he said. Some job seekers have taken to TikTok, shedding tears as they explain their layoffs and ask for help. Others are making creative videos to show their skills, or producing video resumés. Then there’s the multitude of people who are making their case on the professional networking platform LinkedIn. Laura Martyna, a recruiting and human resources professional, created a mini marketing campaign for herself on LinkedIn after being laid off in September. Even though the 43-year-old in Concord, N.C., has more than 15 years of experience, including at Amazon, she said she’s only landed two interviews out of hundreds of job applications. When her dream job at Eli Lilly opened, she listed the reasons the company should hire her. She tagged the company, as well as former colleagues and bosses, whom she asked to add comments to support her effort. She also tagged the hiring manager, who responded with appreciation for the enthusiasm. “I don’t know how else to get flashing lights to get attention,” Martyna said the day after she posted. “It’s worth a shot. Nothing else is working.” Days later, Martyna got an automated rejection letter. But shortly after, the hiring manager asked to set up a meeting to learn more about her. For Martyna, the post paid off. Other job seekers have tried to cast wide nets by using banners that border their LinkedIn profile pictures with the phrase Open to Work. It’s one of the most common banners used, but some who’ve added it complain that it lures scams and bots. As an alternative, some LinkedIn members created their own banners using words like motivated or excited instead. One banner, made by a designer out of Britain, briefly went viral a couple of months ago. It pulled no punches with one blunt word: desperate. Jordan Dye, a 27-year-old, who’s been trying to break into the cybersecurity industry, added it to his profile immediately after seeing it. “I saw an opportunity, took it and then it blew up way bigger than I thought,” said the Dallas resident, who previously had relatively few LinkedIn connections. “I have over 1,600 followers now.” Dye said his post explaining the banner got about a half-million views, connections, and a lot of discussion. But he didn’t hear from hiring managers. He later changed his banner to Dying, playing off his name and the widespread desperation in the market. Dye, who for now isn’t using either banner, estimated he’s applied to 4,500 jobs since June 2023. Another job seeker, Rita Williams, initially used the banner in solidarity with the “desperate” movement. But the 38-year-old, who’s seeking a job as a technical analyst for a social justice reform organization, still displays it after two months, eight interviews, and 500 applications. “It seems like it became an indicator of, ‘Wow this person has been through it,’” she said about the banner. “It generates interest, and people are kinder.” She said she’s also in the process of creating a nonprofit. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said. LinkedIn said people who use the Open to Work banner on average are 40% more likely to receive messages from recruiters and 20% more likely to receive messages from other members. To avoid scams, LinkedIn said job seekers should look for verification badges on job postings and profiles. Given LinkedIn’s easy-apply button, and generative AI, which can quickly tailor a resumé for a specific job, employers and recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of candidates. But two recruiters were mixed on whether social media posts are a reliable way to stand out in the candidate pool. “Some of them are entertaining, but I don’t know if I’d hire based off that,” said Mindy Totaro, a senior creative recruiter at staffing agency Aquent. “Do you understand the skills or is it about just trying to get someone to respond?” Instead, Totaro says job seekers should focus on building relationships with recruiters and hiring managers, even if they don’t pay off right away, and ensure that their resumé skills match the job. It’s also best to be among the first applicants because recruiters sometimes have just 24 hours to present top candidates. To see job postings faster, follow recruiters and employers on social media, she said. But Thomas Vick, a technology employment trends expert and regional president with recruiting firm Robert Half, said creative posts — when done right — may give job seekers a leg up. “Anything that differentiates you in a positive, productive manner, especially if you can highlight how it can be beneficial to the business … it certainly can help,” he said, adding that candidates should try to stand out. Some job seekers exhausted by the void of silence and repeated rejections are becoming brutally honest. Feeling invisible after hundreds of applications, Chuck Williams let his LinkedIn network know that he’s on the verge of losing his house. Williams, a 36-year-old husband and father of two in Richland, Wash., said he was laid off just two months after purchasing the house. Six months later, he made his vulnerable LinkedIn plea for leads. “I genuinely needed to be honest about where I’m at and what I feel,” he said. Since the post, he’s received at least 3,000 comments and messages, mostly from people facing similar struggles. The post hasn’t led to a job, but it did land him two interviews with hiring managers. The outpouring of support that came from that post taught Williams a lesson: “There isn’t a silver bullet here. But what I think resonates with people is honesty.”

Title: What Arm’s CEO makes of the Intel debacle

By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Arm CEO Rene Haas has a unique, bird’s eye view of the tech industry. His company’s chip designs are in the majority of devices you use on a daily basis, from your smartphone to your car. The SoftBank-backed company he leads is worth almost $150 billion, which is now considerably more than Intel. With the news earlier this week that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger “retired” and Intel is evaluating its options for a possible spinoff or outright sale, I wanted to hear what Haas thought should happen to his longtime frenemy. There were reports that he approached Intel about buying a big chunk of the company before Gelsinger was ousted. At the same time, Arm is also rumored to be eyeing an expansion into building its own chips and not just licensing its designs. Haas and I touched on all that and more in an exclusive interview earlier today, which will air in full on a future episode of Decoder. (You can listen to my episode about AI spending in the enterprise that just came out as well.) In the meantime, I wanted to give subscribers the first peek at the highlights from my conversation with Haas. The following interview has been edited and condensed: On what he makes of the Intel situation: As someone who has been in the industry my whole career, it is a little sad to see what’s happening… Intel is an innovation powerhouse. At the same time, you have to innovate in our industry. There are lots of tombstones of great tech companies that don’t reinvent themselves. I think Intel’s biggest dilemma is how to disassociate being either a vertical company or a fabless company, to oversimplify it. That is the fork in the road that they’ve faced for the last decade. Pat [Gelsinger] had a strategy that was very clear that vertical was the way to win. In my opinion, when he took that strategy on in 2021, that was not a three-year strategy. That was a five-to-10-year strategy. He’s gone and there’s a new CEO to be brought in and the decision has to be made. My personal bias says that vertical integration is a pretty powerful thing. If they could get that right, I think they would be in an amazing position. But the cost associated with it is so high that it may be too big of a hill to climb. I’m not going to comment on the rumors that we wanted to buy them. But I think, again, if you’re a vertically integrated company and the power of your strategy is in the fact that you have a product and you have fabs, inherently, you have a potential huge advantage in terms of cost versus the competition. When Pat was the CEO, I did tell him more than once, “You ought to license Arm because if you’ve got your own fabs, fabs are all about volume and we can provide volume.” I wasn’t successful in convincing him to do that. On the rumors that Arm will build its own AI chips: If you’re defining a computer architecture and you’re building the future of computing, one of the things you need to be very mindful of is that link between hardware and software in terms of really understanding where the tradeoffs are being made, where the observations are being made, what are the ultimate benefits to consumers from a chip that has that type of integration. That is easier to do if you’re building something than if you’re licensing IP… If you’re building something, you’re much closer to that interlock, and you have a much better perspective in terms of the design tradeoffs to make. So, if we were to do something, that would be one of the reasons. On Arm’s ongoing lawsuit with Qualcomm: The current update is that it plans to go to trial on December 16th, which isn’t very far away. I can appreciate — because we talk to investors and partners — that what they hate the most is uncertainty. But on the flip side, I would say the principles as to why we filed the claim are unchanged. On Sam Altman’s prediction that AGI will arrive in 2025: I know he has his own definitions for AGI and his reasons for those definitions. I don’t subscribe so much to what is AGI versus ASI [artificial superintelligence]. I think more around when these AI agents start to think and reason and invent. To me, that is a bit of a “cross the Rubicon” moment… If you would have asked me this question a year ago, I would have said it’s quite a ways away. You ask that question now, [and] I say it is much closer. On David Sacks being named President-elect Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar: Kudos to him. I think that’s a pretty good thing. It’s quite fascinating that if you go back eight years to Trump 1.0, in terms of where we were in December as he was starting to fill out his Cabinet choices and appointees, it was a bit chaotic. At the same time, there wasn’t a lot of representation from the tech world. This time around, whether it’s Elon [Musk], whether it’s David [Sacks], whether it’s Vivek [Ramaswamy] — I know Larry Ellison has been very, very involved in terms of discussions with the administration — I think it’s a good thing. Having a seat at the table and having access to policy, I think, is really good. Big leadership changes hit Samsung Electronics this week, per an internal memo I’ve obtained. North America CEO KS Choi is out and has been replaced by Yoonie Joung, a 33-year company veteran. Dave Das now solely oversees the mobile business while former co-head Brent Yoo is heading to Brazil to run sales there. And Shane Higby now runs the following divisions: Home Entertainment, Display, and Digital Appliance. There were a bunch of other shuffles at the C-level, but those are the highlights. Samsung has been restructuring across the board for months now and did layoffs in Choi’s division at the end of September, so this week’s news isn’t really a surprise. Perhaps the company hasn’t announced this news externally yet because its Korean investors will be meeting in the US next week (a company rep didn’t have a comment by press time). “Our sales have been down, especially in consumer electronics,” one company insider tells me. “My guess is that we’re just not hitting our targets quarter-over-quarter and so he [Choi] had to go.” It was fascinating to be in the audience at the DealBook Summit for the first public interview Jeff Bezos has done in years. While I maybe should have been expecting it, I was still shocked at how much he gushed about Donald Trump and his archnemesis for Blue Origin, Elon Musk. Another part of the interview that stood out was when Bezos said he is spending a lot of time at Amazon, “95-percent” of which is focused on AI. This week, Amazon announced its Nova family of foundational AI models at AWS re:Invent — a project I first scooped in this newsletter earlier this year. Amazon is obviously still playing catch-up in the AI race, but it seems to have closed meaningful ground with Nova. If anything, this week shows how quickly the AI race is still shifting. It feels like any of the big players could leap ahead at any moment. Even if you’re an AI skeptic, that’s pretty exciting.

Title: The Concord episode of Secret Level is like a message from a ghost whose unfinished business is creating a global multimedia franchise

The defunct multiplayer shooter speaks from the afterlife in Amazon's upcoming videogame-themed anthology series. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Sometime before Sony hero shooter Concord released, before it was even fully revealed to the public, the producers of Amazon TV series Secret Level—a collection of animated videogame shorts premiering on Prime Video on December 10—started working on an episode based on the game. They didn't know that the short sci-fi tale they were animating would become a message from beyond the grave. The episode, which I've seen in advance of the show's premiere, was supposed to come out in a world where Concord was, if not a Helldivers 2-level hit, a popular and well-liked game. In reality, Concord barely lasted a week. Sony quickly shut the competitive multiplayer game down due to lack of interest, and then shuttered developer Firewalk Studios, which it had acquired partway through Concord's development. I played Concord and I thought it was fun enough, and it was technically sound, but its Bungie-influenced arena shooter stylings just didn't draw a crowd, and neither did its all-in commitment to building a Guardians of the Galaxy-like sci-fi universe with weekly cutscenes. They were going to follow the exploits of a crew of Freegunners—Concord's name for its roguish space mercenaries—whose realistically-rendered faces were a little uncanny. The Secret Level episode portrays the most important moment in the history of the Freegunners, when a heroic crew of outlaws stole a map of navigation routes that allow free travel through the galaxy for enemies of The Guild, a powerful policing body. At the end of the short adventure, we jump to a space pub in the present of Concord's timeline, where the legendary story has just been retold. There, we glimpse the arm of one of Concord's mascots—Lennox, the green guy—and of course we're supposed to think, 'Hey, I know that guy!' But no one does know much about the character, outside of his creators. What we got of Concord's story from the first trailers and cutscenes tell us that he's a daredevil who really loves hot sauce, but there were supposed to have been over a dozen more in-game cinematics by now. The episode comes across like a transmission from a spirit that doesn't know it's dead yet, one that still believes everything went right for Concord and the new game studio. It's the 13th episode of the series—unlucky, eh?—and it'll drop on December 17, although I found its eerie context more notable than the short story itself. Concord is far from the only multiplayer game—or game in general—to struggle or crater this year, although it was the most dramatic impact event. We just learned that Ubisoft isn't going to keep trying to build an audience for free-to-play shooter XDefiant, and it's been an unprecedented year for studio closures and layoffs. More than 300 developers lost their jobs just this week, and thousands more jobs were cut this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for the rest of Secret Level, we watched and rated each episode and liked some of them, but on the whole, the animated shorts didn't charm us much. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League. Secret Level review: our take on every episode of Amazon's videogame anthology show The creators of Secret Level say Bandai Namco encouraged them to do 'whatever we want' with an iconic character: 'We would like audiences to wonder what the f**k they did with Pac-Man' First it was Counter-Strike, now it's GTA RP: Fortnite unveils LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, a 'social roleplay experience in the Lego Fortnite world' PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: HBO’s Casey Bloys Talks Competition From Netflix, International “Reset” & Sky Lawsuit As Audience Given ‘The White Lotus’ & ‘The Last Of Us’ Sneak Peeks At Max Showcase

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Casey Bloys was questioned by press this evening at a rare Max showcase in London as a small number of attendees were treated to sneak peeks of The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. A trio of the streamer’s most anticipated shows were unveiled by the senior U.S. exec including the third season of The White Lotus, which moves to Thailand. The Last of Us video-game adaptation was one of its biggest shows last year and has amassed huge viewing in the UK via Sky. That second series was shown to attendees. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, meanwhile, was displayed in all its humor and irreverence. The prequel takes a somewhat different tone to House of the Dragon and the original Game of Thrones. Also on show were Mark Ruffalo-starring crime drama Task and Stephen King adaptation IT: Welcome to Derry. Related Stories News Faced With Big-Spending Rivals, HBO Celebrates Stand-Up Comedy Nominations In Nascent Globes Category Casting Linda Cardellini Joins Jason Bateman & David Harbour In Steve Conrad's HBO Limited Series 'DTF St. Louis' Bloys was also in London touting Max’s local programing, as the U.S. streamer attempts to shift the narrative on local originals. Local original commissioning was halted in a number of European territories two years ago and layoffs followed, but Bloys, who spoke alongside Salma Hayek Pinault, Diane Kruger and Harry Potter showrunner Francesca Gardiner, said the streamer is in a different place. Watch on Deadline “This is an answer to the reset from a couple of years ago,” he said. “The great Netflix correction was happening [back then] and we were reassessing spending and profitability. We were not alone in that but part of the reason for doing this today was so you could see [local originals are] very much a part of what we are doing going forwards in many territories.” On competition from Netflix, he said Max will remain in its lane rather than taking on the streamer across all genres. “We are knowing that the people who will use Max will probably have both Netflix and Amazon,” he said. “Netflix is big and established and is doing everything. We are leaning into what we do well as a company.” Bloys was also placed under pressure over the lawsuit filed three months ago from long-running partner Sky that is alleging several breaches of a multi-year agreement between the two companies that was signed in 2019 relating to the upcoming Harry Potter series. Sky has long carried HBO content and the pair’s well-known output deal expires soon, with many possibilities for what happens next to Sky content in the UK, Germany and Italy. Bloys said he couldn’t comment on the Sky lawsuit but noted that the pair “have a lot of history and hopefully it gets resolved.” “We have said Max will launch in the UK in 2026,” he added of the relationship with Sky. “What that looks like is ongoing.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

By Lambert Strether of Corrente. Bird Song of the Day Northern Mockingbird, Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, Westchester, New York, United States. “Amazing repertoire of other species’ songs woven into this song. This mockingbird was imitating several species including cardinal, robin, killdeer, Carolina Wren, and Tufted Titmouse. It is unclear whether it was also imitating a Song Sparrow, because one was very nearby and its voice can also be heard on the audio.” * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Assassination Attempts (Plural) “Secret Service director vows reorganization as members of Congress press him over major lapses” [Associated Press]. “During the hearing, Rowe was repeatedly asked by flabbergasted lawmakers how problems so obvious in hindsight were allowed to happen, including communications difficulties between the Secret Service and local law enforcement that help secure events [in Butler, PA] and the building overlooking the rally being left unprotected.” And: “Trump has not yet named his pick to lead the agency.” Democrats en déshabillé “Jeffries stays out of the way as Dems mutiny against senior panel leaders” [Politico]. The deck: “Democrats are increasingly anxious about the incoming Trump administration and are no longer bowing to seniority rules to pick their committee leaders.” About time. More: “Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, 76, announced this week that he would step down from the top Democratic spot on the Natural Resources Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, 77, dropped his bid to continue leading Democrats on Judiciary in the face of a tough challenge from 61-year-old Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland. And Rep. David Scott of Georgia, 79, is facing multiple challenges for the top Democratic spot on the Agriculture Committee. It’s akin to a mutiny, especially given Democrats’ typical deference to seniority in who leads panels. But party lawmakers are increasingly anxious about the incoming Trump administration and full GOP control of Congress. Many feel it’s crucial to have leaders who are proven fighters and can effectively push back on Republican priorities like harsh limits on legal immigration. It echoes the argument many used when they called on President Joe Biden to step off the ticket over the summer. At the center of it all is Jeffries, the minority leader, and his leadership team, who also skipped the seniority line in many ways when they rose to the top ranks two years ago. They have publicly stayed out of it, loath to stand in the way of lawmakers who, like them, chafed at the party’s strict adherence to seniority.” And: “”The caucus will guide these kinds of discussions,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the No. 3 House Democrat. “We’re confident that at this time it’s going to take a Democratic Caucus that’s firing on all cylinders to push back against extremism and to make sure we can carry forward the bipartisan principles that we’ve talked about.'” • Ick. Mush. “Scoop: Pelosi backing “some” House Dem committee ousters” [Axios]. • Maybe, for example– “Scoop: AOC expected to run for top Oversight Committee role” [Axios]. “Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday she is ‘interested’ in the role and has had ‘a lot of outreach from colleagues’ about a run. She told reporters on Wednesday morning that she has ‘spoken with many members of our caucus, including several members of leadership’ about the race. Ocasio-Cortez also laid out her vision for the panel, saying she wants to use it as a ‘communicative platform for public education’ and a vehicle for ‘real legislative work and investigatory work.'” • And speaking of AOC: With Governor Delgado having finally enacted the special master's court-ordered redrawn map, we can now map the 2028 Presidential election by New York's new districts Districts eliminated:NY-10 (Hoylman)NY-14 (Ocasio-Cortez)NY-22 (Tenney) Posting info on key races below pic.twitter.com/fm30EOypjF — Lily in the City (@LilyArtemisTO) December 5, 2024 * * * “Democrats are checked out after their drubbing — here’s how they can reengage” [The Hill]. “Democrats are tuning away from news networks and social media platforms in numbers that are impossible to ignore. MSNBC and CNN saw their ratings slashed in half as exhausted Democrats tuned out post-election. On Twitter (now X, after its acquisition by Elon Musk), lefty users have deserted the platform in droves in favor of competitor Bluesky.” At some point, the exodus of “lefty [sic] users” from X (611 million users) to Bluesky (20 million) will stop. When it does, we’ll have a good reading on how many Blue MAGA there really are. More: “Print outlets are faring even worse, with furious Democrats still canceling their Washington Post subscriptions nearly a month after owner Jeff Bezos spiked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. One in 10 Washington Post subscribers have quit the paper since October, blowing a sizable hole in the paper’s already threadbare earnings. That raises an existential question for media outlets and for Democrats: Where will all those disillusioned eyes go?” And: “Democrats were once masters of the populist message. If they want to rebuild after last month’s electoral disaster, they’ll need to reconnect with that part of their political psyche — fast. ” • They can’t and won’t. As Thomas Frank shows in Listen, Liberal!, liberal Democrats hate the working class. Since improved messaging, if it is to last, implies actually delivering on policy, they’ll fight improved messaging tooth and nail (as will their wealthy donors, as we saw in the Kamala campaign’s refusal to campaign on Lina Khan). Alternatively, of course, the Democrat leadership could believe there’s no problem at all; a few thousand votes here and there and 2028 is practically in the bag. And of course, the Democrat leadership has gradually eviscerated the primary process, so all the leadership will really need to do is go into a smoke-filled room, pick a slightly better candidate than Kamala, and give them more runway than a hundred days. How hard could that be? “Democrats need to take the working class seriously and literally” [Salon]. “And then there was the following phrase (or some version of it) that I heard many times on the bus, the train and in my conversations with Uber and Lyft drivers. “Donald Trump may act crazy or be a jerk, but he is right about that!….” Donald Trump’s raw honesty and lack of a filter or self-censoring are central to his appeal. Many Americans may disagree with the specifics of what Donald Trump says about immigration, women, racial and ethnic minorities, or how he will rule when he is back in power. But as shown by polls and focus groups, many of them do like the fact that Trump, unlike Kamala Harris and the mainstream news media and other elites, is at least talking in a clear and direct way about the things that are causing them anxiety and upset in their daily lives….. To win back their own base voters — and more importantly to expand their support among independents, undecided voters and those who have dropped out of politics and the country’s civic life — Democrats need to do a much better job of listening to everyday people, meeting them where they are and taking their concerns and agency seriously. Whatever one may think about Donald Trump, his propagandists and other agents, at this moment, they and the MAGAverse are doing a much better job of listening to and shaping public opinion and the national narrative and mood than are the Democrats and the legacy news media.” • At first reading, this is another messaging take. But the listening part is not (and I don’t mean a “listening tour.” If there were such a thing as a 21st century precinct captain — online? — they should be doing the listening). “I Watched the Democratic Collapse in Florida. I Fear It’s Happening Nationally” [The Bulwark]. “The truth is we got here because our brand sucks. We tend to put voters in different buckets—black, Hispanic, young, gay, etc.—and treat these groups like they are more progressive than they really are, and somehow unique from each other. At the same time, we’ve made decisions to stop talking to large chunks of the electorate. Some of these decisions can’t be fixed. For example, I wish we would have been more intentional about molding the Obama operation into something more permanent for the party to utilize. Coming out of 2008, rather than investing in partisan infrastructure, many in my party—in some cases led by the Obama White House—encouraged the development of “long-term progressive infrastructure,” with the idea that not-for-profit organizations could better address political needs, instead of state parties. Not only has this experiment failed at the core organizing level in states like Florida, but it has encouraged the idea that Democrats are beholden to progressive groups and values. We should have continued something akin to the old Howard Dean plan to invest in all fifty states.” Thanks, Obama! And the conclusion: “[B]asically, we must get back to listening to the median voter.” Listening, but also leading. The author has this good metaphor: “Has anyone had to buy refrigerator recently? After having previous had one for twelve years, I’m now on my third in seven—not because the actual refrigerator is breaking but because all the ‘smart’ technology on my fridge is. Last time I went in, I said, I just want a dumb fridge that works. Just the basics—works for appliances and for elections.” • Universal concrete material benefitsMR SUBLIMINAL Socialism is that “dumb fridge that works” (see FDR. And the CARES Act). Lead the voters there. Don’t commission another boatload of polling in quest of the mythical “median voter,” recognizable only in retropect by campaign professionals who, if you were sharing a post-prandial libation, would be the first to admit that nobody knows anything. “Will Democrats “Get in Touch” with Working-Class America?” [John Halpin, The Liberal Patriot]. By Betteridge’s Law… “[I]n a comprehensive post-election survey of 4800 working-class voters conducted by PPI and YouGov (including oversamples in the battleground states of AZ, GA, MI, WI, and PA), Republicans outperformed Democrats across every indicator of party leadership and values.” Handy chart: Wowsers. “The Left-Flank Albatross” [Michael Baharaeen, The Liberal Patriot]. “Of course, liberals deserve representation too, and it’s completely fair to be concerned about issues like abortion, climate change, and minority rights. But winning in politics requires meeting voters where they are and catering to the issues they care most about. Harris and her team may protest that they tried to make the economy a central focus of her campaign, downplay hot-button topics, and employ tough rhetoric about the southern border, but none of it resonated with the voters they needed most. As the party moves forward, it must grapple with this reality and learn from it if they are to repair their image and chart a new path.” • It’s weird for an organization that calls itself “Third Way” (cited approvingly in the piece) to keep pushing a binary (left-right) paradigm (as opposed to, say, right-liberal-left tripolar model). I suppose, for them, the “third way” is rightwards (they would say they’re chasing the median voter, but it’s the chasing, and not leading, that’s the problem). Realignment and Legitimacy “The Fight Has Only Just Begun” [The Progressive]. “Once upon a time, a majority of U.S. voters rejected a capable, competent, and intelligent daughter of Black and Indian immigrants in favor of a diminished, ignorant, racist son of a multimillionaire, proving that the United States remained a great country for old, white men.” • This is what passes for “left” analysis at The Progressive. Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

Stay safe out there! Transmission: Covid “Are flu and COVID high now? Here’s how the season has started” [Alexander Tin, CBS]. Tin is a good guy, but Covid is not seasonal. That said: “COVID-19 emergency room visits are ‘low’ or ‘minimal’ in nearly all states, after this year’s late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are “minimal” in all regions, compared to “high” levels around this time last year. ‘Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we’re going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,’ said [University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler]. Both [Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University’s public health school] and Lessler said one major ‘data gap’ making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge. A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections. Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1. ‘We don’t know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID’s evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,’ Lessler said. Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings. ‘I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We’ll see what I think after the season’s done. But right now, I’m a little less sure,’ he said.” • Oh good. Seems like the best indicator would be reports of coughing on the Mommy blogs, at this point… * * * TABLE 1: Daily Covid Charts LEGEND 1) ★ for charts new today; all others are not updated. 2) For a full-size/full-resolution image, Command-click (MacOS) or right-click (Windows) on the chart thumbnail and “open image in new tab.” NOTES [1] (CDC) Good news!

Stats Watch Employment Situation: “United States Initial Jobless Claims” [Trading Economics]. “US initial jobless claims rose to 224,000 for the week ending November 30, from 213,000 in the previous week, above market expectations of 215,000 and marking the highest reading in six weeks. Despite this rise, the results still support the view that the US labor market remains at historically strong levels despite the aggressive tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve in the last quarters, adding leeway for the central bank to slow the pace of monetary loosening should inflation remain stubbornly high.” Employment Situation: “United States Challenger Job Cuts” [Trading Economics]. “US employers announced 57,727 job cuts in November 2024, slightly higher than 55,597 in October and 45,510 a year earlier. The Automotive sector announced the most job cuts (11,506, the highest monthly total since April).” * * * Manufacturing: “Boeing whistleblower sounds alarm over safety at satellite factory: “They’re not gonna listen to me until somebody dies” [CBS]. “Now, Garriott, 53, says, it’s the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management. ‘They’ve taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they’ve put it completely on profit and going fast,’ Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. ‘I’m afraid with Boeing in the hands that it’s in now down here, they’re not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.’ He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company’s Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a ‘toxic culture’ that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn’t properly secured — an incident so catastrophic he compared it to ‘a plane falling out of the sky.’ ‘One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,’ said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. ‘It’s the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.'” • Boeing dropped a satellite???? Manufacturing: “Boeing Plea Deal Over Fatal 737 Max Crashes Rejected by Judge” [Bloomberg]. “Boeing Co.’s plea deal with US prosecutors over two 737 Max jet crashes was rejected by a federal judge, who said plans for choosing an independent monitor minimized the court’s role and required the parties to consider the race of the person appointed. US District Judge Reed O’Connor on Thursday sided with family members of people killed during the crashes, who urged him to reject the agreement on the grounds that it failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the 346 fatalities.” • Oopsie. Manufacturing: “Boeing Defense Fighter Jet Unit Head Retires Amid Leadership Shake-Up” [Simple Flying]. “The head of Boeing Defense’s fighter jet division will step down after two years in the role. Steve Nordlund will be replaced by Dan Gillian, vice president and general manager of Mobility, Surveillance & Bombers, amid a challenging time for the company…. [Boeing Defense Systems] continues to lose money, posting losses of $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Much of this was due to fixed-cost contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker and T-7 Red Hawk programs.” • I bet there aren’t a whole lot of companies that lose money on defense work. Manufacturing: “Boeing Isn’t the Only Plane Maker With Problems. Airbus Just Laid Off 2,000 Workers” [Barron’s]. “Wednesday, Airbus announced it was laying off 2,043 workers in its Defense and Space business. The layoffs amount to about 5% of that business and should be completed by mid-2026. The reductions ‘aim to reduce the company’s fixed cost base, with almost all of the positions affected being so-called overhead positions,’ said Airbus in an emailed statement.” And: “Profits in Airbus’ defense segment have struggled, too, and the company is expected to post a loss for the unit in 2024. Operating profit margins in 2023 came in at 2%, down from 6% in 2020. Airbus’ defense sales in 2024 should amount to about $13 billion; Boeing’s defense business will approach $25 billion. What hasn’t been a problem for either company is commercial aerospace demand. Both companies have backlogs that stretch out years. Building the planes has been tougher.” The Bezzle: NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits.

Tech: Yo, Elon: "I don't want to have to pay for Brain Premium to avoid getting Coca-Cola ads in my sleep." — 12 yo on why he won't get a Neuralink implant — Paul Graham (@paulg) December 4, 2024 Tech: “Federal Court Says Dismantling A Phone To Install Firmware Isn’t A ‘Search,’ Even If Was Done To Facilitate A Search” [TechDirt]. “[T]he narrative says the iPhone was ‘inoperable’ (to use HSI’s own words). But the DHS sent it out to a ‘partner forensic laboratory’ (I’m going to assume this was the FBI), which was able to finally obtain access to the phone by: …replacing its circuit board and re-flashing the device’s firmware. Now, that looks like the sort of thing not covered or considered by previous case law or the original warrant request. This is something else. This is another government party extensively modifying seized property to make it more receptive to phone-cracking efforts. One would think a court would need to be apprised of this opportunity before it became a reality, if for no other reason than the original warrant only authorized a search, not the literal cracking of a cell phone (or its casing, at least) to replace a circuit board and install new firmware. I think the defendant raises a good point. But I also think, given the lack of precedent, the court is not completely wrong to rule that reviving a device so it can be searched isn’t actually a search under the Fourth Amendment. To put it in other physical terms, no court would believe pulling a car out of the water after dredging a lake would be a search, even if the recovered vehicle was searched pursuant to a search warrant.” • Hmm. * * * Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 58 Greed (previous close: 57 Greed) [CNN].

A longtime UnitedHealth executive who left the company about 10 years ago said the company’s executives commonly received threats from people with grievances about UnitedHealth’s coverage policies. The executive, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss a sensitive topic, said unauthorized people would come to the company’s sprawling headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka and try to enter the buildings where executives’ offices are located. Years ago, employees entered the buildings using their badges, but the company added security checkpoints on the ground floor when the threats became more common.” • So the problem’s been festering a long time… What a surprise! And the headline: Thompson was not a “healthcare leader”; he was an insurance executive, some would say the very opposite. Further, the airport bookstore business section-style “leader” is, as ever, vacuous and noxious. Use the title, “CEO,” or the generic, “executives.” I read plenty of accounts in the online Covid community who are a thousand times the “leader” Thompson putatively was, and probably wouldn’t even use that word to describe themselves. Sheesh. “Wealthy Americans Are Now Paying for Their Own Personal Fire Hydrants” [Wall Street Journal]. “The latest sought-after home amenity? Personal fire hydrants. The logic is that when there’s a major disaster there may not be enough fire engines to protect every house in an area. If homeowners have their own hydrant ready to go—along with hoses, nozzles and adapters—and are trained to use it all, that could help reduce the number of homes destroyed. Real-estate agents say mentioning a personal fire hydrant in the marketing materials now helps sell homes….. Personal hydrants are part of a wider trend of homeowners taking wildfire prevention into their own hands. They’re putting in elaborate sprinkler systems, eliminating wood on the exteriors, clearing combustible landscaping and fireproofing roofs.” News of the Wired “The Surprising New History of Horse Domestication” [Scientific American]. “Scholars have long sought to understand how the unique partnership between humans and horses got its start. Until recently, the conventional wisdom was that horses were gradually domesticated by the Yamnaya people beginning more than 5,000 years ago in the grassy plains of western Asia and that this development allowed these people to populate Eurasia, carrying their early Indo-European language and cultural traditions with them.” But: “New genomic analyses led by Pablo Librado of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona and Orlando indicate that the ancestors of modern domestic horses originated in the Black Sea steppes around 2200 B.C.E., nearly 2,000 years later than previously thought. Although we do not yet know exactly the details of their initial domestication, it is clear based on the timing that these horses belonged to post-Yamnaya culture. Patterns in the ancient genomes suggest that in the early centuries of domestication, the horse cultures of the western steppe were selectively breeding these animals for traits such as strength and docility.” • Fascinationg detail on archeological evidence. Well worth a read. “How Typing Transformed Nietzsche’s Consciousness” [MIT Press]. “Amid all this hubbub of opinion and research into the man and his ideas, however, hardly anyone has commented on, or sought to explain, another aspect of Nietzsche: his productivity, and how it changed during his career because of his adoption of a new writing technology. Consider this: Nietzsche wrote four books between 1870 and 1881, or almost one every three years, which is pretty good. After 1881, however, he managed to deliver 10 manuscripts to his publisher in the seven years to 1888, whereupon he became too ill to write any longer. That was a book and a half per year, which is really good. By 1881 Nietzsche had become almost blind, an infirmity that would surely have hampered his longhand writing. How did he manage to improve his work rate? What he did was something seemingly out of character, given his views on modernity and science: He bought a typewriter. To be precise, he purchased a top-of-the-line portable Malling-Hansen writing ball, which was sent specially to him from its inventor in Copenhagen.” And: “The sudden mechanical punctuated strike of the typewriter contrasted starkly with the ruminative flow of the pen; the typewriter encouraged a binary decision, to depress the key or not; whereas the pen with its store of liquid ink, held by surface tension in the nib, or in a small reservoir in the fountain pen, was a more latent and nonmachinic technology….. The German philosopher of technology Friedrich Kittler has claimed that the analog typewriter in general was useful for certain forms of thought: the brief, the succinct, the forms that thrive on concision and quickness…. As Kittler saw it, a celebrated Nietzschean style comprising sustained reflection, long sentences, and complex reasoning had changed ‘from arguments to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style.’ Nietzsche was an early adopter of the technology. He took it to the heady realms of Continental philosophy and — if we consider his immense influence — began to change it through a creative mind that was reshaped by the keys that had replaced the pen.” • Also well worth a read. (In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that). * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Regular positive feedback both makes me feel good and lets me know I’m on the right track with coverage. When I get no donations for three or four days I get worried. More tangibly, a constant trickle of donations helps me with expenses, and I factor in that trickle when setting fundraising goals: Here is the screen that will appear, which I have helpfully annotated: If you hate PayPal, you can email me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, and I will give you directions on how to send a check. Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. “The Fight Has Only Just Begun” [The Progressive]. “Once upon a time, a majority of U.S. voters rejected a capable, competent, and intelligent daughter of Black and Indian immigrants in favor of a diminished, ignorant, racist son of a multimillionaire, proving that the United States remained a great country for old, white men.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I for one will greatly miss Kamala as the big fade makes her go away, she was essentially self-satirizing… only she didn’t know it~ Nixon made a comeback but Harris is no Nixon. I thought Nixon was the worst President ever but with the possible exception of Gerald “East Timor” Ford, every subsequent POTUS was worse. Harris is certainly no Shirley Chisholm. / ;) I have to say I read the teaser and thought they must be talking about some past historical figure, maybe someone from the Seminole people – only when I clicked the link to read further did I realize that they were talking about Harris. Those descriptive adjectives really threw me off. The Democrats did nothing wrong and chose the perfect candidate. It’s all the fault of the voters for not getting with the program. Don’t they know their place? Would you believe that the majority of those voters aren’t even credentialed? Watching a bit of news on CNBC this morning, which is reflecting on the wonderful Biden administration and a great economic stretch. Job markets, the stock indexes, yes that’s a few key indicators that for many in the US, daily life after the Covid 19 impaired period somehow did return to a more normal and routine as it were. Voters had it great under Joe and Kamala, why did the voters not understand this ( sarc ). To the bad, housing and rent is only more expensive. Those able to sell and relocate can either drop a large down payment or are able to absorb the increased mortgage rates. Most if not many daily items for an average American family are not only more expensive but any price declines are seemingly short lived and intermittent in reality. I have a lurking fear the Trump administration is going to miss the target and daily consumer goods and services are not going back in time to lower inflation days. Maybe there is some impact in oil and energy….to me that’s a pivotal input. Added thought, that article from the Progressive did have some wowsers in it. Yowza. Re: The Stoller framing. The lack of surprise by the elites is a byproduct of the white washing of history. “These violent delights have violent ends.” The “aww shucks Iowa corn bloated” routine is just a modern Lord and Lady nonsense. > aww shucks Iowa corn bloated Huh? Healthcare More on the UnitedHealth shooting: Coming later, or forgot to add it? One thing’s for sure, The Invisible Hand which has given so many the middle finger, just pulled the trigger. It’s most certainly there, and has been. The link works, both up top and on the main page. So I don’t know what the issue is. Almost wishing that Hunter did it, since he can’t be prosecuted for it and, for once, a Biden would have done something right. (Well, there’s Luna Khan, too, I guess.) Your mistyping of Luna now has me imagining Lina Khan as a Ravenclaw in the Ministry of Magic being put on loan to the US Govt. to handle the antitrust issue. “I’m sorry Senator, but we simply can’t allow them control that large of a marketshare. The snorkacks won’t survive.” “Yes, Senator, snorkacks. They’re quite essential you see. And do your best to stay healthy. There’s a herd of Thestrals following you around lately.” Ain’t toucg keybaords on tablwts granf? I notice that the guy did not seem to panic when his gun had a mishap but just got on with clearing it. Military training perhaps? I wonder if he was the same guy that planted that pipe bomb during the January 6th riots. They never found him either. Jan 6th… I made a mistake the other day when some PMC types were going off on that day and the lynching. I asked them politely if they knew the gallows were quite a distance from the capital. Remembering our host Lambert’s most excellent breakdown of that. Then explained how it seems against all logic that they could have done such a thing. Nope, I am so wrong, and was admonished appropriately. It seems to me, these people just make their own reality, and no amount of facts are going to change it. And we are the dumb ones. You get the same results when you discuss Ukraine, or Gaza, or economic issues in the US. There’s a crowd that refuses to even imagine another point of view. Regimes of truth and egomania: it’s hard to see one’s own privilege and role in reproducing modern slavery, especially when everyone and everything around you points at a convenient scapegoat: the stupid poor people. Ironic that much of liberal media discourse focuses on the critique of Othering (“it’s the migrants fault”) and then reproduces the same shit narratives (“it’s the poor people’s fault”)… It’s been 36 hours and no capture. The longer he eludes the coppers, the better the odds he gets away with it. Or at least goes into Unabomber/Eric Rudolph territory. I wonder if the FBI has been so caught up in looking for Rooshians hiding in the woods and Jan 6 cosplayers that they forgot how to catch an actual bad guy? Another for the “hot take” category from Taylor Lorenz: ‘People have very justified hatred toward insurance company CEOs because these executives are responsible for an unfathomable amount of death and suffering,’ she wrote on a different post. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14161595/washington-post-taylor-lorenz-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson.html (In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yes, when writing something by pen, I get occasional writer’s block or what if I want to change the wording around in ink, ye gads no. Loved my Selectric II and its distinctive purr when you turned it on, but again you couldn’t easily change things around as you can with this here QWERTY on my laptop. Famous film critic Pauline Kael couldn’t type or drive. She kept her daughter around to type up those cutting reviews for the New Yorker. She was sometimes accused of having a gushy “impressionsistic” style. Blame it on the ball point? Oh yes they did. Boeing has form. Thanks for that satellite info…..I am still amused, thank you sir. Perhaps they forgot that freely falling satellites only stay aloft if they are already in orbit. Sounds like yet another failed experiment in the ongoing attempt to reverse engineer Cavorite. And in a complete coincidence, I have been watching clips from that film the past two days- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHFwNOq59sE (3:42 mins) “the analog typewriter in general was useful for certain forms of thought: the brief, the succinct, the forms that thrive on concision and quickness” So Henry James didn’t own one then. I always found manual typewriters to be a lot of work. Perhaps Nietzsche was saving his fingers. Meanwhile back here in cyberworld I seem to go through keyboards far more often than I like. > So Henry James didn’t own one then. The later Henry James dictated to a stenographer. I don’t know what he did before that. And hence, indeed, the endless circuitousness, the never coming to what would, to some, have seemed to be the, or, at least, a point? I do apprehend the wending ways of the circumlocutious path your eminently enlightening erudition treads on its way to informing and, curiously, subtly encouraging the seeker after esoteric knowledge. Remain without fear; practice the vigilance of Argus with the pugnacity of Cerebrus. Her name was Theodora Bosanquet. She replaced a dour Scot who was an unsatisfactory blunt instrument, and expensive. Her book, “Henry James at Work”, was published in 1924 and is available at Libgen. She auditioned on his Remington though she was more familiar with other machines. Marshall McLuhan, in “Understanding Media”, relates that as James lay dying he asked her to operate the typewriter in an adjacent room so he could hear its sound once more before he passed away. Bosanquet’s editor says the onset of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in ’97 forced James to cease handwriting. Not really about physical keyboards, but about typesetting software for math and such. Game theorists using LaTEX (standard “math” typesetting software) need a lot of practice to draw nice diagrams. I could never get hang of it (I never did become a “real game throrist,” but I played one often enough, and I wondered about my old profs who were very prolific in churning out papers with wondrous diagrams. So, I asked one of them some years later. His response: I draw the diagrams on paper and we have staff that can take care of them. A bunch of lights lit up in my head at that moment. The Hit Point dice were loaded. I recently began a new remote position, performing data review and reconciliation as or after an integral data system upgrade….modern tech ( keyboard, PC displays ) does seem to have a relatively brief or useful life. The keyboard in use seems rather reluctant on certain key strokes. I’ll add it’s a modern inconvenience, of course just like your newer vehicle’s tire gauge going bonkers in a cold snap. My late Mom owned a manual that was indeed loud when it worked, an Underwood model I think. It’s probably collecting rust somewhere. >>Meanwhile back here in cyberworld I seem to go through keyboards far more often than I like. Like everything else, the quality of the keyboards has gone down. After my fourth apple keyboard in as many years, I bought a mechanical keyboard, which is still good after three years. I use a Model M from the late 80s that I converted to USB via the myriad tutorials online I will be dying of thirst in the water wars and this thing will still work. Shame that we can’t make anything that lasts like this anymore. Change the word from “can’t” to “won’t” and you will have penetrated to the heart of the matter. Bang on ambrit. It’s an important distinction to make. I wonder if our Civilization is suffering the effects of planned obsolescence. Question: What could be the “benefits” of financialization for Terran human History? I would have thought the stats we do have on wrongful arrests, cops killing people who called 911, and cops shooting dogs would “lay bare the security risks” for people who are not leadership. Guess not. “That raises an existential question for media outlets and for Democrats: Where will all those disillusioned eyes go?” Sing it, Peter, Paul, and Mary… Where have all…the blue eyes gone? Long time passing. Where have all…the blue eyes gone? To be gaslit. Where have all…the blue eyes gone? Gone to Blue Sky, every one. When will they ever learn? When will they…. ah screw it – I can’t satarize these morons better than they satarize themselves. Boing dropped a satellite???? Was the renaming intentional? It does have a ring to it : ) This has happened before. Back in the 80’s a DMSP got dropped, I think it might have been at the Cape for pre-launch checkout, or I can’t imagine how I would have heard about it. No trace of it online (of course), but it wasn’t Boeing (actually, Hughes, back then). The current prime contractor is Lockheed and/or Northrup, depending on the source, but this source says it was built by GE: https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/dmsp5d2QL.html > Boing dropped a satellite???? I did indeed type “Boing”! Sadly it went crash and not boing. “We should have continued something akin to the old Howard Dean plan to invest in all fifty states“. Aye. I was never particularly a Howard Dean fan, but I’ve always respected the work he did on the “50-state strategy”. The Democrats’ recent strategy of writing off entire states (and entire chunks of the US population) has resulted in a “big tent” that gets smaller every year. It’s a Big Tent, but you and I aren’t invited. It is a big tent in that it admits anyone with the right size check book, ideological convictions, unimportant. Yes, and they’re all pissing outside the tent. They’re drinking a lot of fluids in there, too. “Wealthy Americans Are Now Paying for Their Own Personal Fire Hydrants” Neo-liberalism on the march! We don’ need no stinking fire departments, just do it yourself. Elon’s probably already on it. Private and for profit fire companies were largely extinct in the US by 1875. But I guess along with anarchist style assassinations we’ll see that element of the gilded age return too. I write first drafts by hand. There’s a trance-like feel to it–bordering on the spiritual–that no other medium can quite match. I then type up what I’ve written, editing and revising as I do so. The process is rather efficient, in that you get two drafts done in rapid succession. It results in a higher quality second draft because you’re “rewriting” via the keyboard, which by way of having such a different feel than the pen, allows you to see possibilities (and errors!) you wouldn’t otherwise see if merely editing words already on the screen. Re: Politico article on Dem Leadership… 76, 77, and 79 years of age? No wonder the gaggle of committee chairs didn’t think Biden was too old to run for office again. I guess Feinstein is the model here. Dems only wants to leave office in a wheelchair, drooling on themselves. I Glitch McConnell isn’t far behind, but it seems as if there’s less of a skew towards the aged in the Republican party leadership. I don’t know if term limits are the answer here, but I wouldn’t mind telling people who are 75 and older that they can’t be in office anymore. The Lily in the City tweet has an interesting view of the future. I am assuming they are writing this as something happening after 2026. This because AOC is the only current office holder listed (Governor = Hochul, 10 = Goldman, 22 = Manning). All is speculation… Hmm. AOC moving to the senate? Maybe there’s a retirement in the works. Maybe a biopic about AOCs incredibly hard life. A real Harriet Alger story. With Rachel Zegler playing our scrappy heroine. A “moderne” video version of the obligatory “My Life” pre-Presidential run tome. AOC is just old enough to run for POTUS as of last October. Antoinette of Color might make the cut… Do you mean the Colour Barista, or Pocahauntus? When will the Melanin Deprived get their own grievance status? I don’t know where those maps came from, but they are wrong. Delgado ain’t the governor, Hochul is. It certainly doesn’t represent NY-22 which is basically Syracuse and Utica and points between. The redistricting was done in 2023 and in effect for 2024. Tenny is in NY-24, which wraps around NY-22. NY-22 flipped D and elected Mannion. Mannion, of course, outperformed Harris by a wide margin. Sorry didn’t realize that autocorrect made Manning out of Mannion. Since you were more clear on current positions in the state, I will add more current context for the where did they get that name calculation. Delgado is Lt. Governor and Brad Holman-Sigal is state Senator of the former 27th now 47th district which is part NY-10. Boeing Plea Deal Over Fatal 737 Max Crashes Rejected by Judge” [Bloomberg] This is wild: [The deal was] rejected by a federal judge, who said plans for choosing an independent monitor minimized the court’s role and required the parties to consider the race of the person appointed. Is this a great country, or what? Lambert: “In my own experience, the computer enabled me to finish the work, like the typewriter (and the pen before that).” I for one would be very interested to hear more details on this. Print outlets are faring even worse, with furious Democrats still canceling their Washington Post subscriptions nearly a month after owner Jeff Bezos spiked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. One in 10 Washington Post subscribers have quit the paper since October, blowing a sizable hole in the paper’s already threadbare earnings. That’s a hilarious economic boycott. So the PMC class can stand together economically for a cause they believe in. But they certainly won’t do that as a class where it might help striking workers, say, quitting Amazon Prime, or not going to Starbucks. “Secret Service director touts changes as Congress presses him on Trump assassination attempt” ‘The acting director of the Secret Service said Thursday that the agency is “reorganizing and reimagining” its culture and how it operates following an assassination attempt against Donald Trump on the campaign trail.’ And what would have been the story if that assasin had succeeded in killing Trump? ‘The acting director of the Secret Service said Thursday that the agency is “reorganizing and reimagining” its culture and how it operates following the assassination of Donald Trump on the campaign trail.’ Am I just missing stories, or have the investigations into the two would-be Trump assassins been completely disappeared down the memory hole? It seems highly unusual that this has become such a non-topic. Sara Jane Moore got more attention for her misfire. Squeaky Fromme. ‘AG Brian Schwalb @DCAttorneyGen NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits. Amazon failed to inform customers they were excluded. We are suing Amazon for deceiving DC residents into paying the same price for worse service.’ If this is the same story that I read about yesterday, those two areas excluded happen to be predominately black. Well the map indicates Anacostia, so yes, except the extreme southern which is JB Anacostia-Bolling, home to DIA and Marine-1. Though you can say pretty much the same about much of the district, at least NE and really east of Rock Creek. From I Watched the Democratic Collapse in Florida. I Fear It’s Happening Nationally. So I don’t think that dude understands why he lost Florida, either. At Unite the Country, we saw some of these issues among Hispanics even among the most loyal Democrats in primary states. Polling in both Illinois and Florida showed Democratic Hispanic primary voters starting to react negatively to the socialism talk that came out of our 2020 presidential primaries—so much so that we did pro-Biden mail calling out the “revolution” posture coming from some of the presidential candidates in both states to make it clear he was focused on bread-and-butter issues. Still, despite plenty of people screaming from the rafters, the Biden campaign largely ignored the growing problems associated with the rhetoric of the extreme left. In doing so, it let the narrative settle in. Trump’s gains among Hispanics in Florida were significant: from +27 Clinton to +7 Biden among Hispanics. Because the shift among that electorate was just three points nationally, national Democrats largely wrote it off as an outlier—Florida being Florida, and all. But eventually, we saw that Florida hadn’t been an outlier at all. (bold mine) Meanwhile the Florida Democrat Party fought tooth and nail against Grayson, who famously said that the Republican healthcare plan was “don’t get sick, if you do die quickly”, and went aggressivekly after the banks. The Democrat Party in Florida nuked him from orbit. As I recall, he was accused of influence peddling that pales in comparison to anything the Biden clan has done, but you know how that goes; if you aren’t on the same team, well, the rules are different. Or when Franken got MeToo’d. And on socialism; When was Biden running in 2020 no socialism? This dude must be high as a kite. This is why the Florida Democrat Party keeps losing; incapable of any intelligent reflection. But basically, we must get back to listening to the median voter. Bill Clinton got this. Barack Obama got this. Donald Trump gets this. That median voter probably isn’t the white “soccer mom” or “security mom” or “NASCAR dad” of elections past. Rather, the median voter today is just as likely to be a 38-year old African American father trying to figure out how to raise two kids, or a 28-year-old Hispanic woman struggling with affordable housing. Oh, this is a DLC-type. So, there you have it! We gotta get back to centrism. That’s the Florida Democrat Party. Not sure how centrism is gonna help that Hispanic woman struggling with affordable housing, to say nothing of food and healthcare! ObamaCare, mind you, was centrism! This dude is a tool. Its probably a pre-emptive strike to pollute the wells of analysis to prevent a “not-left-enough” counter-theory from getting a toe-hold. Somewhere, the old New Dealer Claude Pepper must be shaking his head. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Pepper Taibbi article today, public excerpt: Pardon Me, But This Is Bullshit Joe Biden or whoever is running the White House can absolve anyone they please, but Anthony Fauci needs to stand tall before the man. The world is owed answers https://www.racket.news/p/pardon-me-but-this-is-bullshit “NEW: Amazon charges 48,000 DC residents in Wards 7 & 8 for full Prime membership while excluding them from Prime delivery benefits.” Try living anywhere outside of a city….. Amazon seems to make it even slower if you don’t pay for prime. With prime it might take a week, without it’ll take 2. Remarkably, perhaps, in the Tucker Carlson interview with Russian FM Lavrov, Mr. Lavrov stated that there are active back-channel communications between the U.S. and Russia, but that, through them, the U.S. is repeating the themes of more public facing messages. Can you imagine being a Russian radar operator and hearing Western media headlines? The interview is very worth watching. Thanks! “them Western diplomats running away from Lavrov like children” – I liked that story. It reminded me of luncheons in the entertainment industry. Everyone got together and then spoke only to those they would speak to normally. And when there was someone you had an argument with (e.g. someone you had fucked over business-wise) – avoid, avoid, avoid. It’s the idiotic idea to simulate courtesy in the face of public. As if this were some Austian novel. But of course in truth it´s the same dumb trick as Lavrov shakes his head over – they run away and by avoiding him they think some Reaper Drone 10.000 miles away will take care of the poblem. Instead of admitting a mistake and talk it over with Lavrov in person. But those people can´t actually communicate like decent human beings. Be it the political class or entertainment folks. Which makes an argument for why Hollywood, the media and politics are so close in the West. They share the same sick rules of conduct and pathologic mindset. What he was picturing, it really felt familiar! Ref: CEO dead from lead poisoning … I’ve wondered when they might get on the menu sans the usual going postal event or political targets. I mean when the Übermensch Homo economicus stalwarts would – like most of human history – like the priests/administrators of the elites in antiquity start being taken out by the unwashed. Maybe like M Moors old TV the Awful Truth people will start live streaming these events or MSM will do it for them post event. Anywho … social psychology suggests such events can lead to more of them … till then … Martyanov a bit on infantry tactics by the RUs. The topic starts at about TC 22:00 Syria and Clockwork. My latest. Why it is hard to fight a combined arms war. https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2024/12/syria-and-clockwork.html So imagine the rage from those that were forced take an experimental, non-sterilizing shot for which the manufacturer has liability immunity, or possibly lose employment, and face homelessness or starvation. It’s not just health insurance that people are angry about, although anger over that is more universal; those on the left were fully onboard with mandating non-sterilizing shots, because brunch. And The Science ™. The American Electorate was given the choice between a Pseudo-Eugenicist Party and a Real Eugenicist Party. The result was predictable. Caitlin Johnstone Phony Anti-Establishment Schtick https://consortiumnews.com/2024/12/05/caitlin-johnstone-phony-anti-establishment-schtick/ “In 2028 U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will probably run for president campaigning on the Democratic Party version of the same faux-populist message, just as Bernie Sanders did. This dynamic poses a major obstacle to those who yearn for real revolutionary change. It’s becoming increasingly necessary to not just stand against the status quo but against the fraudulent political factions which pretend to oppose it. It’s no longer enough to reject establishment politics and media, we also need to reject the fake anti-establishment politics and media which seek to herd a discontented populace away from meaningful revolutionary movements. There are probably people reading this right now who’ve fallen into this very trap, who started reading my stuff because they see me opposing wars and criticizing the media and assume I support the same things they support, even as they throw their support behind a fraudulent political movement that’s ultimately designed to keep the wars going and make the mass media propaganda more effective. Last time Trump was president I’d always get his fuzzbrained empire simps trying to convince me their guy was ending the wars and fighting against the deep state, twisting themselves into all kinds of cognitive pretzels when I’d present them with hard evidence to the contrary.” Your email address will not be published.

Title: The 10 gaming trends for 2025 that will transform how we play and create

Our expert games writer predicts the gaming trends for 2025, including Nintendo Switch 2, the rise of indie gaming, the impact of generative AI and how Unreal Engine 5 will shake things up . When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Predicting the gaming trends for 2025 starts with reflecting on what's happened in 2024. After another tumultuous year of layoffs and studio closures, many folks in the games industry will be staggering into 2025 with an understandable sense of anxiety. As while Epic Games has had a good year with Unreal Engine 5 and Nintendo continues to buck the trends, many studios have suffered. But there are some potential bright spots ahead. The launch of Nintendo Switch 2 (read our Switch 2 rumours feature for the latest info), the follow-up to the almighty Switch handheld, is sure to buoy the industry, as will the juggernaut that is GTA 6, even if it swallows attention from other titles like a black hole sucking in light. Yet there’s still that lingering sense of unease. Can new live-service games succeed in the market, given the disaster of Concord? Will generative AI improve games, or make things worse? Will Microsoft's Game Pass succeed, or are subscription services on the way out? In the midst of all this uncertainty, it’s perhaps comforting that games with relatively simple, old-school design are cutting through, like the excellent Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 and Still Wakes The Deep, indicating that bigger, more beautiful and more complicated worlds aren’t necessarily better, or even what players particularly want. The rise of 'AAA-lite' games, advances in AI for indie development, more cross-platform and cross-media games, as well perhaps a relaunch of classic IP as publishers play on nostalgia in the wake of Silent Hill 2: Remake's success, could all point to a better, more balanced year for games and indies. In light of all that, here are ten gaming trends and predictions to look out for in 2025. These include new launches, advances in tech, new ways of working and more. Anticipation is mounting for the follow-up to Nintendo’s mega-hit Switch console, which has sold more than 146 million units since its release in March 2017. Nintendo has said that an announcement on Switch 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will be made by the end of March 2025 at the latest, and we already know it will be backwards compatible with the Switch. Will Nintendo play it safe by essentially making another Switch with beefier specs and a better screen? Or will Nintendo follow past precedent by introducing some kind of new hardware gimmick? My money’s on some kind of dual-screen setup, toying with our love and nostalgia for Nintendo DS, but Nintendo does like to surprise us. Remember that alarm clock? We curate the best offers on creative kit and give our expert recommendations to save you time this Black Friday. Upgrade your setup for less with Creative Bloq. What seems almost certain is that we’ll get a new 3D Mario, probably as a launch title, since it’s been seven whole years since the last one, Super Mario Odyssey. And if we’re lucky, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond might make its long-awaited debut alongside the new console, ever since being teased at a Nintendo Direct earlier this year. Sony's live service shooter Concord was the biggest video-game flop of 2024, shut down just two weeks after its launch in August as a result of catastrophically low player counts. Sony later shuttered the game’s creator, Firewalk Studios, having only bought the studio in 2023. Earlier in the year, Warner Bros.’ Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made a similarly disappointing debut, showing that even licensed properties can struggle in vain to attract players away from well-established live-service titles such as Fortnite and GTAV. These high-profile failures are likely to make big publishers think twice about launching new live-service titles in 2025. At Sony, as reported in sister site Games Radar, The Last of Us Online has already been cancelled, but reportedly there’s still a Horizon MMO in the works: it remains to be seen whether it will live to see the light of day, given the Concord debacle. Sony also has at least two other live-service games lined up, currently without a firm release date: Marathon from Bungie, developer of Destiny 2 (read our deep dive into making the The Final Shape expansion), and Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios. Will they release in 2025? And can they fare any better? Concord has shown how difficult it is to launch new IP in the live-service space, but one game could potentially buck the trend: early feedback on Valve’s Deadlock has been positive from sister games site PCGamer, and there’s every chance it could burst out of beta in 2025. Microsoft reportedly had some lengthy internal debates (according to The Verge) about whether to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. Since the purchase of Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty has become Microsoft’s jewel in the crown, but shoving the new CoD game onto Microsoft’s subscription service would naturally mean sacrificing some hefty day-one sales on Xbox. The fact that it happened shows Microsoft is committed to making Game Pass succeed. Circana reported that Game Pass subscriptions surged on the release of Black Ops 6, but the big question is whether these new subscribers will stick around for the long haul. Expect to see older Call of Duty games being drip fed onto Game Pass over the next 12 months to keep these new subscribers interested. Microsoft has a lot coming to, and on, Game Pass, including the new Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle blockbuster, Stalker 2 and in 2025 Avowed from respected RPG team Obsidian Entertainment is come to the service, alongside Fable, DOOM: The Dark Ages and Gears of War E-Day. At the same time, Microsoft is pushing Game Pass onto as many devices as possible, including Samsung TVs and Amazon Fire Stick, backed by the confusing ‘This is an Xbox’ ad campaign. There's a clear strategy to move beyond hardware and release games across platforms, something other publishers are also looking into, including Sony with its PlayStation Plus subscription. But if subscriber numbers falter in 2025, this could signal the end of the Game Pass experiment: if Call of Duty can’t make subscribers stick around, then surely nothing can. The past two years have seen the release of a plethora of big-hitter VR and AR devices, including PSVR2, Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 (all featured in our best VR headsets roundup). But 2025 seems to be a bit quieter on the new hardware front. "We're unlikely to see Apple's next headset this year, though reports on the specific timeline are conflicted," says Henry Stockdale, staff writer at UploadVR. "Samsung's upcoming Android XR headset is also on the way, but that's reportedly been delayed,” he adds, meaning we’re increasingly unlikely to see it in 2025. But there’s an outside chance that Valve might spring a surprise. “We've recently seen controller models emerge on SteamVR for the rumoured Valve Deckard,” Henry says, referring to Valve’s long-in-gestation follow up to its Index VR headset from 2019. “Knowing Valve though, whether that's actually coming soon is anyone's guess.” Although Apple Vision Pro 2 might be a long way off, there’s a chance we could see a cheaper version of the Apple Vision headset by the end of the year, which could give Meta a headache, unless Quest 4 is incoming. The idea of creating generative-AI powered non-player characters (NPCs) has captivated some, who see it as a way to generate realistic, expansive conversations in place of characters that default to the same repeating phrases. Others, meanwhile, like Inkle’s Jon Ingold, merely regard it as a way of “creating an unworkable design purely to employ AI”. Whatever your viewpoint, we will start to see generative-AI powered NPCs emerge in 2025, such as the antagonist of Meaning Machine’s Dead Meat, a game that sees you posing questions to a large language model-powered suspect in an attempt to extract a murder confession. We might also start to see the first NPCs made using Nvidia ACE, which is now available as a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. We've already got to test Nvidia's character AI for games and it's actually remarkable, but also fallible and has revealed good writers will be in demand even with gen AI characters. Other major developers are experimenting with gen AI for game design and NPCs, ahead of them all seems to be Ubisoft, that could have a game out in 2025 which makes use of Nvidia Audio2Face AI, to create its own NEO NPC, as well as other AI apps. Read 'How Ubisoft’s New generative AI prototype changes the narrative for NPCs' for an insight. Since its release in 2013, GTA V has sold well over 200 million copies, and the launch of GTA 6 is set to upend all sales records, such is the demand for a sequel. Indeed, the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in 2025 was so momentous that it broke through the navel-gazing world of video games and into the world at large, making headlines on the BBC and other mainstream news channels. Accordingly, although GTA 6 is likely to lift the overall revenue of the games industry, its debut will be devastating for any games released in its wake. "No one will play anything else for six months after it," says Mike Rose, head of indie publisher No More Robots. "In the weeks, months after GTA 6 comes out, some people will never buy a game ever again. They'll play this game, and that will be it: it will become their Roblox." Sam Barlow, founder of Immortality maker Half Mermaid Productions, has noted the trend for more ambitious, open-world indie games like Sable and Tchia over the past few years, with “people stepping out of the assumptions around pixel art and two-dimensional things into more full-bodied 3D experiences”. He thinks this trend will continue in 2025, with indie developers using engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 6 to streamline many processes and create bigger worlds rather than making the prettiest games possible. "The cool thing with indies is, if you have more powerful machines and engines, it's not about maxing them out, it's just you can make things quicker". Indie auteur Sam Barlow isn't the first developer to say this, when we spoke with Anna Hollinrake about making her first game as an indie dev, the colourful open-world narrative game Crescent County, she revealed the move to Unreal Engine 5 made the larger world design, for a small team, possible. "We actually ended up making it too big," she told us. The EU Digital Markets Act has paved the way for rival app stores to come to iOS, and the Epic Game Store has already launched on Apple devices. “Unfortunately very few people seem to have noticed,” says Neil Long, founder of MobileGamer.biz, “and I’m not all that confident that even the promise of regular free games, like Epic offers through its PC store, will help.” Neil thinks that the monster hit Fortnite isn’t enough to tempt most people away from Apple’s own App Store, or Google’s equivalent. “Epic needs more killer content to get people to use its stores and make it clear why people should bother when the default iOS and Android stores do a solid job,” he says. Microsoft is also likely to launch its own app store in 2025. But Neil points out that the Redmond giant’s mobile strategy has been “all over the place”, so he isn’t confident that either Epic or Microsoft can attract sufficient customer numbers, “even though the market desperately needs new contenders to rein in Apple and Google, who are utterly dominant.” We've seen Apple itself push new mobile hardware to gamers, including seeing more Triple-A game releases on iPad, such Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 for iPhone. The mobile space is set to grow and become more important in 2025, and we've already seen both Unity and Unreal Engine 5.5 promote new tools for development on mobile platforms. There's a convergence happening with technology, as Unreal Engine and Unity become as useful outside of game development as within. We've seen in the past how Unreal us used to create immersive live experiences, such as Frameless in London that puts you into classic works of art and its use in filmmaking to drive LED Volume stages, the kind used by ILM for Star Wars. Just this month Felix & Paul Studios has announced a new 20,000-Square-Foot 'Interstellar Arc' mixed reality experience that will launch in Las Vegas in 2025 to rival the Las Vegas Sphere for tech and spectacle. This could lead to more virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality events launching in 2025, particularly as publishers look to leverage brands in new ways. Already an early contender to take your money, at least in the UK, is the upcoming Pac-Man Live experience that uses similar immersive tech as an Unreal Volume to out players into the Pac-Man maze as they're chased by augmented reality ghosts. Expect more immersive events in 2025 as gaming and game design evolves from the screen and into real life in new ways, especially with advances in AI like the Move AI's mocap 'Live' system that can capture movement and put it into scenes on a screen in real time. Sam Barlow notes that some of the biggest hits of the past year have relied on tried and tested design elements. “I mean, Metaphor: ReFantazio is pretty much literally a PS2 game in the way it’s set up,” he says, calling it “an extremely archaic RPG design” that is “extremely confident and polished in what it's doing”. He gives Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl as another example. “They're not even necessarily embracing a lot of the technical progress that's been made,” he says of the game that has dominated his recent playing time. “Stalker 2 is a 2000s PC game: it doesn't have cool, emergent physics, all the stuff that Zelda: Breath of the Wild did to innovate open world. It's not doing any of that. It's them going, ‘What if we made a 2000s PC game, but we can do 100 times as many trees?’.” Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which shot past 4.5 million sales in a month is an old-fashioned Xbox 360-style shooter that simply refines classic ideas and reworks them for new players. Its success, and that of other old-school new releases, shows that players seem happy to embrace simpler game design, perhaps even as a form of nostalgia. It’s likely other studios will take note and follow suit in 2025. The wake of team downsizing and studio closures, and soaring development costs, combined with 'smaller' games performing well in 2024, a big game design trend for 2025 will see the return of well-made, polished, smaller-scale games made on sustainable budgets with a blend of AAA ambition and indie sensibilities. Likewise, publishers will look at the buzz around brand revivals like Silent Hill 2, Dragon Quest III HD-2D and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and want to replicate those successes. We already have Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and The Thing Remastered from remaster specials Nightdive Studios, so expect something special from Sony in particular. While it's clear Nintendo Switch 2, generative AI, new tools for Unreal Engine 5, the rise of indies and more will happen in 2025, there are some outside chances of other things happening in video games.

Title: Godot Isn't Making it

Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment. Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling. It's unclear how much further this farce continues, if only because it isn't obvious what it is that anybody gets by investing in future rounds in OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other generative AI company. At some point they must make money, and the entire dream has been built around the idea that all of these GPUs and all of this money would eventually spit out something revolutionary. Yet what we have is clunky, ugly, messy, larcenous, environmentally-destructive and mediocre. Generative AI was a reckless pursuit, one that shows a total lack of creativity and sense in the minds of big tech and venture capital, one where there was never anything really impressive other than the amount of money it could burn and the amount of times Sam Altman could say something stupid and get quoted for it. I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what happens here. The future was always one that demanded that big tech spent more to make even bigger models that would at some point become useful, and that isn't happening. In pursuit of doing so, big tech invested hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure specifically to follow one goal, and put AI front and center at their businesses, claiming it was the future without ever considering what they'd do if it wasn't. The revenue isn't coming. The products aren't coming. "Orion," OpenAI's next model, will underwhelm, as will its competitors' models, and at some point somebody is going to blink in one of the hyperscalers, and the AI era will be over. Almost every single generative AI company that you’ve heard of is deeply unprofitable, and there are few innovations coming to save them from the atrophy of the foundation models. I feel sad and exhausted as I write this, drained as I look at the many times I’ve tried to warn people, frustrated at the many members of the media that failed to push back against the overpromises and outright lies of people like Sam Altman, and full of dread as I consider the economic ramifications of this industry collapsing. Once the AI bubble pops, there are no other hyper-growth markets left, which will in turn lead to a bloodbath in big tech stocks as they realize that they’re out of big ideas to convince the street that they’re going to grow forever. There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.
