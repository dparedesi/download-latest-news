By JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a long-standing U.S. ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” That post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: Why CEOs Should Develop AI Acumen To Lead In 2025 And Beyond

ByRussell Sarder ByRussell Sarder, Forbes Councils Member. Chairman & CEO Russell Sarder leads NetCom Learning with a mission to build a world of lifelong learners. Today’s CEOs face challenges their predecessors couldn’t have imagined. From ethical concerns to governance complexities and workforce upheaval, the stakes are high. To face these challenges, numerous industries, including supply chain management and customer service, are revolutionizing their workforces through the use of AI tools. In fact, studies show that as much as 30% of tasks in 60% of jobs (registration required) can be automated by AI. A few months ago, I caught up with a friend who is the CEO of a mid-sized tech firm. He had felt behind on AI integration, unsure of how to incorporate it into his business. But after diving into AI, he implemented it in his customer service operations. The result was a significant surge in customer satisfaction within months. This was a complete transformation, not just a small improvement. I believe this underscores a lesson we all need to internalize: Rather than being just another tool, AI is an important part of a competitive strategy in today's market. AI isn’t going away; rather, it's reshaping businesses. According to a Cisco study, 75% of leaders state confidence that AI will open new opportunities and disrupt their industry, and 83% already consider it a strategic necessity. I've witnessed in my own company how using AI-driven analytics to predict demand and optimize inventory can lead to reduced waste, cost savings and the ability to anticipate market trends. However, implementing AI effectively can be more challenging than leaders anticipate. According to a study, many are underprepared for the expected AI disruption to their industry: 62% of surveyed companies experience difficulties in cross-functional alignment during implementation, and 63% struggle to adjust workflows. What's more, research shows that "51% of IT leaders (registration required) cited governance and regulatory compliance challenges as their primary concern with AI initiatives." Integrating AI isn’t just about increasing efficiency—it can also help with differentiation. Think about Amazon. Its AI-driven recommendation algorithm doesn’t just suggest products—it predicts what you’ll want based on your browsing habits. That's part of why Amazon sales are sky-high. On the other hand, Nvidia suffered a $593 billion market value loss in a single day due to a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI innovator. DeepSeek’s energy-efficient AI model outpaced Nvidia’s, shifting the balance of power. Similarly, Intel’s failure to keep up in the AI chip market led to layoffs and a $10 billion reduction in capital spending. These losses emphasize both how AI is disrupting industries and how important it is for CEOs to prepare for this shift in order to protect market share and company valuation. In my experience, CEOs cannot afford to delegate AI knowledge. You need to grasp AI in order to make informed decisions about investments, AI models or governance frameworks. While 75% of executives rank AI among their top three strategic priorities, only 16% of organizations have met their AI-related goals. I believe this gap is because AI success hinges less on technology and more on the CEO's active, visible leadership. To bridge the gap, pursue AI literacy with intent. This means understanding what AI can and cannot do, as well as how it applies to your business. Start by exploring credible resources like online courses, executive programs and industry reports. I also recommend participating in roundtables, summits and AI governance forums to engage with evolving norms and practices. Understanding how AI may optimize interconnected functions requires more than simply installing a solution in one area of your company. For instance, by strategically incorporating AI into HR and Operations, you can potentially raise staff engagement and make your team more unified and effective. You can also leverage AI tools to promote comprehensive plans that improve multiple areas at once, such as improving customer satisfaction, streamlining processes and raising employee satisfaction levels. McKinsey’s 2025 analysis reveals a pronounced asymmetry: 13% of employees indicate that GenAI now comprises over 30% of their daily functions, yet C-suite leaders estimate that only 4% of their employees have reached that level. This disparity helps underscore the importance of education initiatives. In my experience, effective AI training begins by anchoring learning to real business impact. Strengthen your training frameworks by balancing conceptual grounding with applied experience. Initial sessions should introduce essential concepts, clarify the boundaries of what AI can and cannot do and address common misconceptions. From there, shift into practical immersion. Identify one high-impact area, like sales forecasting, customer support or inventory planning, and pilot a focused solution. Use that project as both proof of value and a learning vehicle. Once it has been validated, scale with discipline and with training embedded at each stage. Finally, training should be seen as an ongoing process. One common pitfall I've encountered is the assumption that early exposure is sufficient. Another is over-relying on third-party programs without building internal ownership. One of the most damaging missteps, however, is deploying AI technologies in production environments before equipping your teams to use them ethically, accurately and with contextual understanding. As Ben Cook, president of Acumen Learning, warns, "If you don’t understand the business, you have no business using AI." Today, the flip side is equally important: If you don’t understand AI, you could struggle to lead your business in 2025. To lead in the AI-driven future, I believe we, as CEOs, must experiment with AI, learn new things constantly and establish a strong foundation within our companies. The question isn’t if AI will reshape your industry—it’s whether you’ll be the disruptor or the disrupted. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

All rights reserved President Donald Trump silences his phone that rang twice as he was speaking to reporters after signing executive orders regarding nuclear energy in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 23, 2025, in Washington, as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth watch. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. Recommended Videos The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).

It’s at 50%.”The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations.

Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states.

But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs.

Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included.

Title: “The future of retail”: Walmart eliminates 1,500 jobs to replace with AI

Brooke Sjoberg In recent years, many large companies have chosen to embrace automated intelligence to help produce leaner, more efficient operations at the corporate level. For the most part, this has mostly occurred in the technology sector at companies like Microsoft, as well as Google and Amazon. A total of about 61,000 technology sector jobs have been caught in the crossfire of layoffs in the wake of companies adopting AI. But it’s not just tech companies, as retail businesses have entered the chat. Even the company known for the smiling faces of its door greeters has fallen to AI use. That’s right—the company known for literal smiley faces as part of its branding in the early aughts has announced it will lay off 1,500 of its employees at the corporate level. Most of these positions are concentrated in the Bentonville, Arkansas, and Hoboken, New Jersey hubs, as reported by FingerLakes1.com. According to reporting on the issue from FingerLakes, the Bentonville-headquartered company is choosing to restructure to “sharpen focus” and embrace automation. The cuts were described by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Global Chief Technology Officer Suresh Kumar in a joint letter to employees as necessary for building the “future of retail,” FingerLakes reports. “We are eliminating roles as well as opening some new ones aligned with our business priorities and growth strategy,” the memo shared with employees reads. The use of automated intelligence in the retail space has become a hot-button issue for many retailers. Just as Walmart has made its intention to use AI in corporate roles public, Starbucks has elected to “go slow” on its rollout of AI and focus on higher staffing. Notably, Amazon began using AI-powered audio product summaries to help shoppers learn more about other customers’ experiences. On the customer-facing side of operations, Walmart is also reportedly preparing for shoppers to use AI to build grocery lists and potentially make purchasing decisions for them. As the company catches heat amid national conversations about tariffs, company officials have reportedly confirmed that the retailer will absorb some of the cost increase, as well as pass a portion of it to consumers. Regarding layoffs, impacted employees will receive support in this transition, representatives of Walmart said, as reported by FingerLakes. Despite the cuts, the company said it would likely be adding positions related to AI and “digital transformation.” Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: New SSA chief praises DOGE for ‘making things better’

Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security Administration, arrives to testify at his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on March 25, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Social Security Administration’s new commissioner, Frank Bisignano, told managers in a meeting yesterday that he represents “consistency” and “stability” for the agency and that the presence of the Department of Government Efficiency at SSA has been a good thing. “Social Security is not going anywhere,” Bisignano said during the meeting, which Nextgov/FCW obtained a recording of, promising to improve morale at the agency while acknowledging recent “turmoil.” A new entrant to government service, having spent his prior career in the financial services industry, Bisignano told attendees at the meeting that he had to Google his new job when he was offered it. “I looked up like, I’ll be honest,” he said. “I’m like, what the heck's the Commissioner of Social Security?” “So I’m Googling Social Security. One of my great skills, I’m one of the great Googlers on the East coast. Put that as the headline for the Post,” he told managers at the meeting, during which he frequently noted his desire to prevent news leaks. “One of my main jobs is not having newspaper articles saying we’re a problem,” said Bisignano. An SSA official said Bisignano was “clearly” making a joke about needing to Google the responsibilities of his position. The Senate confirmed him earlier this month despite accusations that he’d lied during his confirmation hearing. Democrats cited his reputation for cutting workforces in the private sector in their opposition to his nomination. “Commissioner Bisignano’s proven success in the financial services industry uniquely positions him to lead the Trump Administration’s commonsense efforts to modernize the agency and improve its efficiency,” Liz Huston, a White House spokesperson, told Nextgov/FCW after it reached out to SSA for comment. The career finance executive spoke Wednesday about his intentions concerning further workforce cuts, the use of technology at the agency and more. His tenure follows months of upheaval at SSA, which has indeed placed the agency in the news for customer service problems. Recently, the agency reversed an anti-fraud policy that was slowing down retirement processing and hurting customer service after it found essentially no fraud. That policy was put in place after leaders at the Department of Government Efficiency and White House repeated false and misleading claims about SSA phone lines being riddled with fraud. Bisignano defended DOGE during the meeting, telling employees that, “your bias has to be — because mine is — [that] DOGE is helping make things better.” “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read,” he added. Related articles SSA tech shop to be led by another DOGE associate SSA weighs axing payments to 170,000 beneficiaries SSA has also been reassigning staff across the agency, moving many to the front lines. It has also made draft plans to cut its workforce by thousands, even as its staffing was already at a 25-year low in fiscal 2022. Many staff have already left the agency through the administration's deferred resignation program or early retirement. “I have no intent to RIF people,” he said Wednesday, using the acronym for reduction in force, a government term for layoffs. But he didn’t rule out further cuts. “If I wake up and we can do all our work with 20,000 people — which I can't see that right about now — well, then we'll be 20,000. If I wake up and see, we need 80,000, we'll be 80,000,” he said. “I gotta determine what the right staffing level is. But nobody asked me to come do this job and RIF people.” The agency announced plans in February to shrink its workforce to 50,000 employees, down from about 57,000, first through voluntary departures and then through layoffs. Downsizing the federal workforce has been a priority for the Trump administration. An SSA official told Nextgov/FCW that Bisignano is visiting offices and meeting employees to hear their ideas for how the agency can better serve customers in-person, on the telephone and online. The new commissioner said that technology and automation are top priorities, arguing that SSA needs to use artificial intelligence on high-labor tasks, move off of paper and push people to do things online instead of come into SSA offices. He pointed to the lengthy disability determination process as one where “there’s a ton of things that AI can apply to move it along faster.” Right now, it takes applicants about seven months to get an initial decision for disability benefits. People who appeal that decision wait another eight months, and those that request a hearing wait over nine months. Thirty thousand people died waiting for their benefit determinations in fiscal 2023, Nextgov/FCW previously reported. The disability policy landscape is extremely complicated, making it difficult to administer, and the agency has also gotten less funding over the last decade. “Tech’s got to be the great enabler, right,” said Bisignano. “We’re going to invest.” Jack Smalligan, who formerly worked at the Office of Management and Budget and recently helped write a report on SSA and AI, and is also a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute, previously told Nextgov/FCW that AI could help the agency. But the technology also comes with risks like bias and staffing reductions, which could push the agency to use tools that aren’t ready, he warned. “I think we should get a lot more done on the web,” Bisignano told managers. “You’re competing with experiences that people have on Amazon.” “I mean, the best thing that could happen is we answer the phone in one minute, a lot of it through technology. We turned around our claims, whether they were disability or retirement, at much different speed, right? Our web was unbelievable,” he said. The agency previously shuttered the office that had overhauled the SSA website, putting employees on administrative leave. SSA later brought some of those staff back, installing them elsewhere throughout the agency.

Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Time Published: 2025-05-22T18:00:59Z
Full Content:
Legal Issues This story was originally published by ProPublica. Republished under a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license. One of Elon Musk’s employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young’s dual role — working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency — likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is “duplicative.’’ Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that “would cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality” and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration’s efforts to unwind the consumer agency’s operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young’s arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB — which regulates companies that provide financial services — has jurisdiction over Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world’s richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory, “Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” “Musk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,” said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. “And therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk’s personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.” Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk’s political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk’s payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry’s interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk’s Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to “advise political and public policy.” Beyond that description, it’s not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company’s activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk’s family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk’s children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE’s activities, said that Young’s government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. “Which hat are you wearing while you’re serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?” she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk’s private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will “continue to participate” in a “defined contribution plan” sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a “vice president” of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on “political and public policy,” the records show. While he lists the latter among “sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn’t respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn’t return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn’t responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, “I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.” The revelation of Young’s apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration’s attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning — actions one expert called a “pretty clear-cut violation” of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he “did not even manage” the layoffs, “making this entire narrative an outright lie.” A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn’t clear whether he did and the White House hasn’t answered questions about that. “These allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE’s critical mission,” the White House said. Following ProPublica’s reporting, the aide’s work at the CFPB ended. Last Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica’s coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to “swiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.” ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it’s unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE’s efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. “It matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,” she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB’s acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau’s staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency’s employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration’s first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB’s headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency’s acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including “all contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.” Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk’s Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the “present.” Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration’s cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB’s chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a “reduction in force,” or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were “prepared to implement the RIF” if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration’s proposed cuts. In addition to his employment, Young’s disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau’s “Prohibited Holdings” list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock’s value — such as stripping the CFPB of its staff — constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn’t responded to questions about that either. Filed Under: cfpb, christopher young, conflict of interest, doge, elon musk, ethics Companies: europa 100 I’m wondering why a company based in America, owned by an African, is called Europa 100. The most innocent explanation is that it’s named after one of the moon’s of Jupiter. Somewhat less innocent is that it refers to the literal embodiment of Zeus’s horniness.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: bankruptcy, diamond, hermes press Hermes Press reports that Diamond Comic Distributors is "effectively halting distribution" of comic books Hermes Press has told its customers that Diamond Comic Distributors has "laid off most of their employees, effectively halting distribution of our products and many others." Their statement reads as follows: "For the past 20 years, Hermes Press has used Diamond Comics for distribution to comic shops and websites like Amazon. In January, Diamond declared bankruptcy but continued to operate. This past weekend, as some may be aware, Diamond laid off most of their employees, effectively halting distribution of our products and many others. Good news – we are still waiting on final arrival of George Wilson, Phantom 34, and the Dark Shadows Paper Doll book (expected next week). We have always received the products before Diamond, before shipping out to their distribution center for fulfillment on their end. This is why those who ordered directly from us generally get their products before those elsewhere. Now for the bad news – if you ordered any of these titles or future titles from Amazon especially, or other sites, they will not be fulfilled for an undetermined amount of time as we look for a new distributor. As of now, the only way to get our books will be directly through our website. We know this isn't ideal for everyone, but it is the only current option while we work through this change. "If you are a comic book shop and want to get our products, please reach out to info@hermespress.com directly to discuss options on getting direct shipment and pricing from us. We want to help in any way we can as we know you are also moving through this transition and trying to fill orders. We need your help and support now, more than ever. We are still sending books to the printer and receiving products, and we plan to continue for a very long time. If you need to pre-order titles, especially those arriving in the near future, please do so at www.hermespress.com and use code MEMORIAL25 for 25% off your order, good through May 27 at 11:50 p.m. (est). We appreciate your support and look forward to getting books into your hands shortly. Please note there may be a delay in email responses as we work through shipping, we are a small team who loves what we do and sometimes it just takes a little time. Thank you for your patience. " Hermes Press exclusively produces books and comic strip reprints focusing on the art and artists of the comics, cartoon and comic strips, pulp magazines of the 1920s and 1930s, art books covering science fiction, and popular culture. Popular titles include The Phantom, Dark Shadows, Johnny Hazard, and the work of Frank Thorne as well as titles such as Bear With Me, Abby Curled Up on a Roll, The Lazy Goth, and more.

Title: Microsoft is racing to build an AI ‘agent factory’
URL: https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/672598/microsoft-ai-agent-factory-jay-parikh-interview
Time Published: 2025-05-22T15:51:43Z
Full Content:
An interview with Microsoft’s new CoreAI chief. by Tom Warren When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ran into Meta’s former engineering chief, Jay Parikh, at a conference last summer, he had the future of AI top of mind. The pair have known each other for around 15 years, but this meeting was different, and Nadella called Parikh shortly after bumping into him to dig into what was really on his mind. “We were chatting about the future and chatting about all the stuff he needs to do here and that the team needs to do around AI,” Parikh, now head of Microsoft’s CoreAI team, tells The Verge. “That’s when he said, ‘Hey, why don’t you come join and help me transform the company around all of this AI stuff?’” Nadella regularly talks about Microsoft being part of a new AI era, but he now wants the company to overhaul how it builds software to meet this new era head-on. Parikh, who transformed Facebook engineering teams, now leads a transformation that he describes as building an AI “agent factory” for Microsoft’s customers. ”I described this agent factory idea to Bill [Gates], not knowing that he and Paul [Allen] described Microsoft 50 years ago as the software factory,” Parikh says. “Just like how Bill had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory.” In essence, this idea of an AI agent factory is Microsoft’s way of redefining its platform that businesses around the world already rely on and finding a coherent way to leverage the best bits of GitHub, Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and even Azure to let businesses “build their own factory to build agents,” Parikh says. Parikh has only been at Microsoft for a little over six months, but the company is already moving at pace toward this agent factory goal. “We have rewired some of the ways we do product development here, to support this vision of building the products and platform that we do in this agent factory mode,” he says. Parikh has also been pushing some of his team, many of whom are the core developer division of Microsoft, to adopt AI and get ready for this transformation that he’s now in charge of. I’ve heard he regularly sends an email missive about AI to his team, sometimes even on a Saturday morning. He’s described himself in the past as having a “quiet intensity,” where he’ll listen to lots of opinions and then push teams to a particular goal with that learned knowledge. This experience has led him to oversee a variety of projects in the past, including Meta’s experimental solar-powered drone project to provide internet to remote locations and some of the key engineering at Akamai that kept the world’s biggest websites online. Pushing Microsoft’s developers to build technology that could eventually replace their previous coding efforts might just be his greatest challenge yet. Not only will Parikh have to convince his team of this change, but Microsoft also needs to convince businesses that its vision of AI agents isn’t just another chatbot idea that, outside of ChatGPT, hasn’t really produced results. “In the last couple of years, we were looking at mostly chatbots with AI… everyone was clamoring for where’s the ROI? And frankly there was no ROI, that was people dipping their toes in the water and understanding what was there,” Parikh says. “Now, people are moving on from that and the models are super super advanced, compared to even a year ago.” Parikh envisions a future where app developers start with AI first. “Instead of duct-taping a little AI to an existing app, what we want the platform to support is you start with the model, then you leverage the scaffolding that’s there in the platform.” Microsoft isn’t alone in this AI agent push. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others are racing toward this idea of AI agents controlling parts of our digital life or automating the tasks at work that we’d rather not have to do. OpenAI, Microsoft’s key partner in its AI efforts, is also building its own platform that could easily compete with Microsoft’s work. “We want to be people’s core AI subscription,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent interview. “Some of that will be what you do inside ChatGPT, we’ll have a couple of other key parts of that subscription. But mostly we will hopefully build this smarter and smarter model and have these surfaces like future devices and future things that are sort of similar to operating systems.” That sounds like OpenAI could certainly compete with Microsoft’s various platforms and hardware, particularly as the AI lab just acquired Jony Ive’s AI startup in a nearly $6.5 billion deal that could shake up the nascent AI hardware market and really bring these AI agents to life. It certainly feels like everyone in tech is now racing toward a similar goal of owning what they believe to be the next wave of computing. It’s fast-paced, ever changing, and the future of who wins is uncertain, but Microsoft seems determined to meet the moment, even embracing the open-source Model Context Protocol as part of a push to reshape Windows in a world of AI agents. “We just have to learn the fastest. If we’re learning the fastest out of everybody out there, I feel confident that we’ll deliver great value to our customers and hone into our craft of these products working well,” says Parikh. “That’s what we’ve got to do. It’s exciting and it’s not for the faint of heart.” Note: I interviewed Parikh ahead of a Palestinian tech worker interrupting his keynote at Build earlier this week, when the company was still refusing to comment on its cloud and AI contracts with the Israeli government. Microsoft eventually issued a statement a few days after my interview. Microsoft held its Build developer conference in Seattle this week, and while the news wasn’t earth-shattering this year, it was certainly an eventful week. Top announcements included Microsoft’s plan to fix the web by letting websites run AI search for cheap, Windows getting native MCP support, and the surprise open-sourcing of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Outside of that, this year’s Microsoft Build will, for many, be remembered more for protests and the surprise appearance of Elon Musk. Alongside the more than 6,000 layoffs at Microsoft earlier this month, a lot of employees I’ve spoken to recently are feeling anxious about the direction Microsoft is taking. On Monday, just minutes after Satya Nadella began delivering the opening keynote, Microsoft employee Joe Lopez yelled, “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” Moments later, Lopez sent an email to thousands of Microsoft employees. He was fired later that day. The keynote on Build’s second day was also interrupted, this time by a Palestinian tech worker that disrupted Jay Parikh, forcing him to briefly pause his presentation and for Microsoft to mute its livestream. Then on Wednesday, two former Microsoft employees disrupted a Build developer session, where the commotion led to a Microsoft executive inadvertently revealing internal messages regarding Walmart’s use of AI. The protests came just days after Microsoft had acknowledged its cloud and AI contracts with Israel, but it claimed it had found “no evidence” that its tools were used to “target or harm people” in Gaza. Lopez wasn’t the only Microsoft employee to send a mass email this week. Jasmina Mathieu, a senior product designer at Microsoft, announced her resignation to thousands of colleagues including the company’s leadership, and decried Microsoft’s response to employee protesters. “It may work as a PR stunt but it’s easy to conclude, that if the Israeli government is using Azure, they are using it to enable the genocide in Gaza,” Mathieu said. Late on Wednesday, Microsoft responded again to the protests, this time by temporarily blocking any emails sent within the company that include the terms “Palestine,” “Gaza,” and “genocide” in email subject lines or in the body of a message. Microsoft confirmed it had made some changes to its email system in a statement to The Verge. “Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate,” said Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw. Microsoft’s response to concerns over its Israeli contracts wasn’t the only thing causing controversy among employees this week. I’ve spoken to multiple Microsoft employees who weren’t happy to see Elon Musk appear virtually at Build this week. Nadella invited Musk as part of the announcement that xAI’s Grok 3 models are now available on Azure AI Foundry. It was obvious that this would be a controversial move internally, but I understand Nadella has been pushing for it regardless of any potential fallout with employees.

Title: Walmart says it's cutting roles to 'remove layers and complexity'

Walmart is laying off corporate staff in the US to "remove layers and complexity." The retailer will lay off 1,500 employees, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that the layoffs were in the company's Arkansas headquarters and other offices. The retailer's US CEO, John Furner, and global technology chief, Suresh Kumar, announced the layoffs in a Wednesday memo to corporate staff titled "Building for the future," seen by BI. "We are reshaping some teams in our Global Tech and Walmart U.S. organizations where we have identified opportunities to remove layers and complexity, speed up decision-making, and help associates innovate rapidly," the memo wrote. It added that the technology team would be slimmed down to simplify its structure and "facilitate speed and innovation." Aside from the layoffs, Walmart will also be opening new roles that align with its business priorities and growth strategy, the memo read. Walmart is not the only company flattening its corporate structure. Big Tech companies, like Amazon, Google, and Intel, have been cutting middle managers to boost efficiency. On the retail side, Amazon said in September that it would increase the ratio of its workers to supervisors by at least 15%. The news of Walmart's layoffs comes about a week after the retailer announced in an earnings call that it would increase the prices of its products due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Walmart said it imports a third of what it sells in the US from outside the country, such as China, Vietnam, and Mexico. Although Trump has paused his additional tariffs, Walmart's CFO said reduced tariff rates are still "too high." "Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," CEO Doug McMillon said in the earnings call. Walmart reported a 2.5% revenue growth in its latest quarter compared to the year before, with sales of $165.60 billion. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: The Era of the Business Idiot

Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that — assume we believe him, and this wasn’t merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft’s AI tech — Copilot consumes Nadella’s life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive — who makes over 300 times more than their average worker — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.” She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company — a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 — but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control — we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers — they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about. They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we’re worth even less than before — which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better — the Business Idiot doesn’t really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don’t, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I’m making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media’s true allegiance lies — the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office — ridiculous statements about how remote work “failed young people” (it didn’t) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because “the chitchat, lunches and happy hours” are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they’d say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party — which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers’ ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud — that “...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees” — because when you can’t do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they’re doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired — and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want — but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability — laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we’d be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the “ultimate computer…is the mixed reality world” and that Microsoft would be “inventing new computers and new computing” in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft’s next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn’t overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let’s see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse” play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media — outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods — those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end — are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw “reckless spending” and “management dysfunction” according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla’s lunch, offering better products for half the price — and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others — like Chery — are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network — despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation — decisions made by non-workers who don’t understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let’s not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it’s sold, and that’s illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter’s worth of inventory that it can’t sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it’s at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don’t use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what’s the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won’t see it, because Meta’s algorithm decided it wouldn’t drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn’t had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which…uh…was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn’t clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta’s AI chatbots are, and I quote, “empowered to engage in ‘romantic role-play’ that can turn explicit” — even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, — instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite — which it’s only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it’s making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 — and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it’s a company that’s totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let’s be clear: Amazon’s recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn’t already. Then there’s the worst of them — Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don’t worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don’t have a choice about using it, because it’s now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They’re alienated from people. They’re alienated from workers. They’re alienated from their customers. They’re alienated from the world. They’re deeply antisocial and misanthropic — as demonstrated by Zuck’s moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we’re seeing now with generative AI isn’t a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that’s rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn’t define value as we do, because “value” gets defined by a faceless shareholder as “growth.” And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard — the foot soldiers — of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don’t have — and perhaps isn’t possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They’re people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the “abundance” agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old’s birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI’s broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is “looking at stuff that is relevant.” And really, that’s the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they’ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don’t play, about the money they’ve raised and the scale they’ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don’t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to anyone. It’s something you have to deliberately work at. It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Title: Upfronts 2025 Takeaways & Report Card: Amazon and Netflix Return Strong, Scripted Programming Purged on Broadcast
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/upfronts-2025-takeaways-report-card-amazon-netflix-nbcu-fox-1236405146/

Music always plays a large role at the annual TV upfronts, as media buyers, journalists, execs and other attendees are ushered in and out of these showcases to loud playlists — often spun by celebrity DJs. But this year, one number heard throughout the week came with a hefty dose of irony: Doechii’s popular track “Anxiety.”In the song, Doechii sings about how her anxiety “keep on trying me / My anxiety, can’t shake it off of me.” Perhaps a bit too on the nose for the media congloms to be piping into Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom and other upfronts venues. After all, no matter how hard media execs try to spin that things are fine — that’s hardly the case: Production is down, budgets keep getting slashed and studios like Paramount Global (still awaiting news on its Skydance merger) continue to be the subject of speculation about their ultimate survival.Anxiety rules this business, and yet, the show must go on. Last week NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and YouTube all promoted their broad portfolios, with varying degrees of success.Live sports are clearly still the driving factor in the conglomerates’ programming strategies, and movies are part of upfronts now. A decline in scripted programming on the broadcast networks’ fall schedules is a telling sign that the TV business continues to evolve, with some of the biggest scripted bets of next season (like “The Office” follow-up “The Paper”) going to streaming instead of the traditional Big 4.By the end of upfronts week, attendees heard so many competing pitches for their ad dollars that it was hard to keep the messages straight. But here are some of Variety’s biggest takeaways from the 2025 upfronts. Related Stories VIP+ How the UFC Can Punch Above Its Weight in Next TV Rights Deal What Recession? Popular on Variety It’s an undeniable fact: The entertainment business is in roughfinancial shape. Like the rest of the country, media companies have been affected by President Trump’s tariffs and general economic upheaval. The Peak TV era, marked by blank checks for massive tentpole productions, is over. Earnings have taken a hit. Layoffs have impacted thousands. Everyone is on the hunt for more cost-effective programming. Of course, you’d get very little sense of that had you attended the upfronts. Save for a scant few passing mentions, you’d have no idea that Hollywood is facing these economic choppy times.Martin Short told the audience at Disney’s presentation that “there’s no tariffs on standing ovations,” earning a guffaw, while one Fox exec at the Manhattan Center told the crowd, “The winds of change continue to sweep through our industry and our economy.”That’s about it for mentions of anything to do with the economy this upfronts week. Understandably, media companies don’t want to scare advertisers with lots of doom and gloom. Much of TV is about escapism, after all. But completely ignoring reality is not the best policy either.Scripted Purge on Broadcast Scripted programming took a big hit on the broadcast networks this upfronts season. With the release of the fall schedules, nearly all of the major broadcasters have shifted their focus to unscripted programming and sports.The numbers don’t lie: ABC will have only five hours of scripted programming a week in the fall. Fox will have four. NBC canceled five scripted shows, with virtually no pilots in the works to replace them. CBS was the only network that committed heavily to more scripted shows, but even those were mostly spinoffs (sorry, “universe expansions”). Those included “Sheriff Country,” “Boston Blue,” “CIA” and “Y: Marshals.”Scripted shows cost more to make, and the broadcast networks aren’t drawing nearly as many customers as streamers. And there was never any doubt NBC was going to eventize the return of NBA coverage on the network.But if there’s one thing broadcast can do well, it’s weekly procedurals and broad comedies. Both formats continue to be popular, but the networks don’t seem in any rush to find the next big show.One thing’s for sure — the nostalgia reboot/revival wave has officially crashed. NBC axed “Suits LA” after just one season, despite the original show’s massive streaming success. The network also canceled the “Night Court” follow-up with Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette after three seasons, even though it started out strong in the ratings. Maybe it’s time for some original ideas to get their time in the spotlight? What’s in a Name? Whomever media companies are paying to come up with the names for new platforms deserves either a raise or a demotion. A major theme of the upfronts was branding or rebranding (or re-re-branding, in one case) with names that lacked creativity.Among the top stories of the week, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed that Max would be known as HBO Max … again. Two years after the David Zaslav regime dropped the HBO part of its streaming service’s name, HBO boss Casey Bloys announced onstage that “HBO Max” was back — earning a wide range of reactions, from laughter to applause. It could have been worse. They could have gone with Max+.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled its ESPN streaming service, which will be called … ESPN. The streamer will offer an unlimited plan that includes all ESPN networks and ESPN broadcasts on ABC for $30 a month. The irony is, that’s more than is currently offered on ESPN+. As Jimmy Kimmel put it during his annual upfront roast, “The plus is now, in many ways, a minus.”Finally there is Versant, the spinoff of NBC-Universal that will house cable brands like USA Network, Syfy, E!, CNBC and MSNBC. Aside from the fact that no one can tell you what “Versant” means, the name lacks the pop of SpinCo, the moniker the company used before someone landed on its official name.“We Come to This Place for Ad Sales” It’s official — movies are as much a part of upfronts as TV. While upfronts were once exclusively about television shows, feature films now play a major role in media company pitches to advertisers.NBCUniversal, for the second year in a row, spent a lot of time talking up “Wicked” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good.” Donna Langley, chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, and director Jon M. Chu both took the stage to hype the sequel and reveal trailers and a musical special coming to NBC. Not only that, but ad sales chief Mark Marshall made his entrance from the rafters dressed in a Glinda-inspired pink suit.Amazon’s upfront featured appearances by John Cena, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who talked up their upcoming films with Prime Video. Courtenay Valenti, Amazon’s head of theatrical and streaming film, hit the stage to delve into the film slate. She talked about Amazon’s “Thomas Crown Affair” reboot with Michael B. Jordan — with Jordan himself coming out to reveal a series spinoff of the “Creed” film franchise.Over at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront, the company devoted a big portion of its presentation to James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios. In fairness, that included DC TV shows like “Peacemaker” Season 2 and the upcoming “Lanterns,” but it also had Gunn, Safran and Shaquille O’Neal revealing a brand-new trailer for Gunn’s “Superman” movie.While companies are all about showing off their entire portfolios to advertisers, it’s still jarring to see that TV is only a portion of the upfronts experience now. Sports, Sports, Sports Sports programming has always been a major factor at the upfronts, but never more so than now. Linear TV still has the edge when it comes to live sports, and outlets like NBC are making the most of that. The broadcaster made its 11- year deal for NBA and WNBA rights a central part of its upfront, bringing out multiple current stars and revealing that Michael Jordan will be part of the network’s basketball coverage.Other traditional TV outlets, in an effort to stave off live sports gains made by streamers, have gone all in not just on major players like the NFL, the NBA and the NHL, but also on basically any sports rights deal they can get their hands on. College-level sports of all kinds and smaller leagues got their time in the spotlight. But streamers made their sports presence felt more than ever. YouTube will livestream an NFL game for free in 2025. Amazon and Netflix announced major games for “Thursday Night Football” and the Christmas Day doubleheader, respectively. Netflix got NFL commissioner Roger Goodell onstage (in a Santa coat, no less) to announce the 2025 Christmas surprise.Of course, not all the sports moments were highlight reel-worthy. At Fox’s presentation, Tom Brady somehow missed an easy pass to Rob Gronkowski, with the ball sailing into the crowd, while Blake Griffin got smoked in a Pop-a-Shot shoot-off against former NFL star Ryan Fitzpatrick Upfronts Report Card Amazon Grade: ABest star moment: Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger going off scriptBest pitch: Michael B.

And condolences to whoever got drilled by that errant football courtesy of Tom Brady.

As Seth Meyers joked, it sounds like a medication, not a media organization.Biggest bet on a show NBA on NBC NBCU’s presentation took two hours and felt even longer. But the company had a lot to promote (including fan favorites BravoCon and “Wicked”), and shout-out to Mark Marshall for risking his life with his flying entrance. Netflix Grade: ABest star moment: Jerry Jones going way off scriptBest pitch: Jude Law and Jason Bateman teasing “Black Rabbit”Best use of music: “Thunderstruck” featuring the Dallas Cowboys cheerleadersWorst use of jargon: “Our biggest titles … are not just shows anymore. They’re vibes.”Biggest bet on a show: “Stranger Things” final season Netflix put on a much heftier showcase of its new and returning offerings than it did last year. The presentation ran barely 80 minutes, but packed in a ton of info and news. Warner Bros. Discovery Grade: B-Best star moment: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest pitch: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest use of music: Guns N’ Roses’ “Patience” in the “Task” trailerWorst use of jargon: “We believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition.”Biggest bet on a show: “Dancing With Sharks” (yes, that’s a real show) Warner Bros. Discovery was doing well at first, but its event went on too long. Maybe Tony Shalhoub didn’t need to hype his bread show? This upfront also definitely lacked the razzle-dazzle and star power of years past. YouTube Grade: B-Best star moment: Lady Gaga’s rollicking five-song setBest pitch: Creator Brittany Broski saying her BroskiReport podcast channel has “1 million subscribers who never hit the ‘Skip ad’ button”Best use of music: Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” as CEO Neal Mohan’s walk-on songWorst use of jargon: “Culture,” as in YouTube is “the epicenter of culture” YouTube had only one major piece of content news to share: Its rights deal with the NFL to livestream a free game in the 2025 season. They did a good job of showcasing new ad formats, creators and marketing results. And Gaga’s performance brought down the house.

Title: H-1B demand hits three-year low amid US crackdowns, tech layoffs

A total of 358,737 applications were received this year—down from over 480,000 last year—making it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration’s “America First” and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump’s previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. “As companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,” said Sharma. “Employers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.” Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. “The L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,” she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. “If the economic climate improves and there’s a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,” she said.

Title: Blog: Whatever Happened To 'Working From Home'? Why Your Boss Wants You Back In Office

Time Published: 2025-05-20T13:30:18Z

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about “fauxductivity” - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of £7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers. (Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media) Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves. Tim Cook is likely bothered more about what shareholders and analysts think of the way he manages his company's huge cash pile - estimated at well over $300 billion - than an oddball statement from Trump about moving all production to America. The US' federal debt is a staggering $36 trillion and its debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world; as of 2025 only seven countries owed more money than they earned. The tragedy of Piku is that in the effort to raise a feminist daughter, Bhashkor inadvertently created a woman who cannot separate agency from obligation. She has the freedom to walk away, but no inner permission to exercise it. The problem of Nagaland and the northeastern states stems from an aggressive China that has, over the years, waged a non-conventional war against India directly and indirectly, using Myanmar. A Qatari official told CNN the plane would be a 'gift to the Pentagon', a 'government-to-government transaction' that will then be 'donated' to Trump's presidential library. On February 20, 2025, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed to be a KGB officer, made the most fantastic of Facebook posts - that in 1987 Russia recruited a then 40-year-old Donald Trump as an 'intelligence asset'. On board the rocket was EOS-9, designed to provide continuous and reliable remote sensing data for operational applications across various sectors. For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals. Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza has entered its most intense phase yet with the expansion of Operation Gideon's Chariot.

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks
URL: https://time.com/7286691/business-roundtable-mia-trumps-attacks/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T19:42:20Z
Full Content:
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

ByExpert Panel® ByExpert Panel®, Forbes Councils Member. To a layperson, technology and biological life may seem like opposite poles. However, the tech industry regularly draws lessons from living organisms, striving to build tools and systems that not only learn, adapt and evolve—like artificial intelligence—but can also make decisions and take action in real time, as humans do. From neural networks to swarm robotics, many of today’s most sophisticated technologies are inspired by the natural functions and collective behavior of living organisms. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share compelling real-world examples of “living intelligence” technologies, as well as natural creatures and phenomena that are inspiring adaptive tech systems and tools. Read on to learn what the convergence of nature and technology signals for the future of humanity. As a cancer scientist, I use digital AI technology to analyze cancer tissue slides. I am impressed that this innovative technology can predict immune cell types with spatial context. It can derive thousands of features that human eyes can’t see. I can see a gold mine in front of us—some of these features can be groundbreaking in detecting cancer and predicting the outcomes of therapies. - Rachel Tam, Bristol Myers Squibb Starlings exemplify one of nature’s most mesmerizing displays of swarm intelligence in action. Their behavior demonstrates how simple sets of localized rules can give rise to complex collective phenomena. This natural model has applications in modeling complex systems through simple interaction rules, giving rise to emergent properties and behaviors that are otherwise difficult to simulate holistically. - Anuradha Weeraman, Verdentra Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? Neuralink’s brain-computer interface, which enables a person with quadriplegia to control devices with their thoughts, is stunning. It’s living intelligence merging AI and biotech to restore personal autonomy. Implications include revolutionizing healthcare and enhancing human capabilities—but it also raises ethical questions about privacy and cognitive augmentation. - Lori Schafer, Digital Wave Technology Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot, which can autonomously navigate complex terrains, is a powerful example of living intelligence in action. Its ability to adapt in real time mirrors biological instinct. The broader implication? AI and robotics are evolving from scripted automation to embodied cognition, unlocking transformative potential in defense, disaster response and industry. - Srinivasa Rao Bittla, Adobe Inc. One real-world example of living intelligence that impressed me is DeepMind’s AlphaFold. It accurately predicted protein structures, solving a 50-year-old challenge in biology. This breakthrough accelerates drug discovery and disease understanding—a glimpse into AI’s potential to revolutionize science and healthcare. - Akhilesh Sharma, A3Logics Inc. AI-powered satellite imagery analysis for deforestation monitoring has impressed me. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the Global Forest Watch project has improved accuracy and speed in detecting forest loss. This highlights the potential for AI to drive environmental sustainability and inform policy decisions, ultimately contributing to more effective conservation efforts. - Pooja Jain, Meta (Facebook) A compelling example of living intelligence in cloud and DevOps is Netflix’s Chaos Engineering platform, which simulates real-world failures to proactively test system resilience. This intelligent, self-healing infrastructure ensures uptime and performance at scale, highlighting how AI-driven automation and observability can revolutionize system reliability and DevOps maturity. - Hrushikesh Deshmukh, Fannie Mae One of the most interesting cases is one developed by Alibaba Cloud. “ET City Brain” monitors the entire traffic flow of the city of Hangzhou, China, in real time, analyzing cameras, sensors, GPS and traffic lights in order to optimize circulation and reduce traffic jams. Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barberá Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature’s teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros—all without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature’s “dumb” systems often outsmart centralized control—sometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks—the “wood-wide web”—fascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems—an insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla’s self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data. Their neural network adapts continuously, making decisions that improve over time. This dynamic AI system is transforming transportation and holds broad implications for industries like healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, offering new potential for automation and efficiency. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The human brain’s ability to recognize patterns and make decisions is a prime example of living intelligence that has deeply influenced the field of artificial intelligence. The brain’s ability to process complex data through interconnected neurons, for instance, has inspired the development of neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing. - Udit Mehrotra, Amazon Urban crows in Japan drop nuts onto crosswalks, timing traffic to crack shells and safely retrieve food—an elegant display of living intelligence improvising and adapting to an urban environment. Crows offer inspiration for AI and robotics: context-aware, adaptive and seamlessly integrated with human infrastructure. - Amy Gu, Dynamsoft Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology stands out as a prime example of living intelligence within the e-commerce field. The system enables customers to purchase items without waiting in lines by integrating AI technology with sensors and computer vision. The retail industry is being transformed through this seamless shopping experience toward fully autonomous and personalized, frictionless retail commerce. - Amit Ojha One real-world example of living intelligence is autonomous threat detection in financial networks using AI and behavioral analytics. I have seen systems flag and isolate anomalies in real time, without human intervention. The broader impact is clear: It proves that living intelligence can adapt, learn continuously and defend complex environments with speed and precision. - Srikanth Bellamkonda Over 10 years ago, Zappos impressed me with a smart checkout prompt: After I ordered shoes, its system suggested rubber boots because of the rain forecast around my delivery date. It blended personal context with weather data—a great early example of living intelligence, long before the likes of ChatGPT normalized the use of AI. - Agur Jõgi, Pipedrive A standout example of living intelligence is Costa Group’s use of computer-vision-powered robotic pollinators in tomato greenhouses. In place of bees, these AI-driven robots improved yield by up to 15%. This showcases how smart automation can solve ecological and regulatory challenges, opening doors for sustainable, tech-enabled agriculture worldwide. - Tarun Eldho Alias, Neem Inc. Humans are being inspired by slime mold's strategic mastery. Physarum polycephalum is a brainless single-celled organism that can solve mazes and optimize nutrient pathways, challenging our notions of intelligence. Its ability to make decisions and adapt to complex environments suggests cognition may be more distributed than we think. It’s inspiring developments in decentralized computing, robotics and urban planning. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies An AI tool that analyzes credit risk adapts to real-time life events like layoffs or health bills. Analyzing nontraditional signals can redefine lending fairness. This living intelligence bridges empathy and economics, hinting at a future where automated finance tools react with humanlike instinct. - Jitender Jain

On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. “Recognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,” Schall said on the REIT’s earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird’s-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. “Over the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,” Breslin said. “About 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.” AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here’s more on what’s happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn’t been seen in 20 years. “Our established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,” Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT’s properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. “Northern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,” Breslin said. “Performance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.” As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro’s availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB’s year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. “We'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,” Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB’s coastal markets. “While we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,” Schall said. “On the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.” In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. “These are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,” Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay’s chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. “And that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.” Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay “You think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,” Breslin said. “You look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.” AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. “As these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,” Schall said.
