Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that — assume we believe him, and this wasn’t merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft’s AI tech — Copilot consumes Nadella’s life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive — who makes over 300 times more than their average worker — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.” She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company — a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 — but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control — we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers — they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about. They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we’re worth even less than before — which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better — the Business Idiot doesn’t really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don’t, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I’m making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media’s true allegiance lies — the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office — ridiculous statements about how remote work “failed young people” (it didn’t) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because “the chitchat, lunches and happy hours” are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they’d say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party — which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers’ ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud — that “...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees” — because when you can’t do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they’re doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired — and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want — but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability — laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we’d be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the “ultimate computer…is the mixed reality world” and that Microsoft would be “inventing new computers and new computing” in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft’s next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn’t overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let’s see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse” play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media — outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods — those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end — are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw “reckless spending” and “management dysfunction” according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla’s lunch, offering better products for half the price — and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others — like Chery — are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network — despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation — decisions made by non-workers who don’t understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let’s not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it’s sold, and that’s illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter’s worth of inventory that it can’t sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it’s at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don’t use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what’s the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won’t see it, because Meta’s algorithm decided it wouldn’t drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn’t had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which…uh…was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn’t clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta’s AI chatbots are, and I quote, “empowered to engage in ‘romantic role-play’ that can turn explicit” — even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, — instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite — which it’s only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it’s making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 — and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it’s a company that’s totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let’s be clear: Amazon’s recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn’t already. Then there’s the worst of them — Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don’t worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don’t have a choice about using it, because it’s now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They’re alienated from people. They’re alienated from workers. They’re alienated from their customers. They’re alienated from the world. They’re deeply antisocial and misanthropic — as demonstrated by Zuck’s moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we’re seeing now with generative AI isn’t a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that’s rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn’t define value as we do, because “value” gets defined by a faceless shareholder as “growth.” And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard — the foot soldiers — of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don’t have — and perhaps isn’t possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They’re people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the “abundance” agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old’s birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI’s broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is “looking at stuff that is relevant.” And really, that’s the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they’ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don’t play, about the money they’ve raised and the scale they’ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don’t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to anyone. It’s something you have to deliberately work at. It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Title: Upfronts 2025 Takeaways & Report Card: Amazon and Netflix Return Strong, Scripted Programming Purged on Broadcast

Music always plays a large role at the annual TV upfronts, as media buyers, journalists, execs and other attendees are ushered in and out of these showcases to loud playlists — often spun by celebrity DJs. But this year, one number heard throughout the week came with a hefty dose of irony: Doechii’s popular track “Anxiety.”In the song, Doechii sings about how her anxiety “keep on trying me / My anxiety, can’t shake it off of me.” Perhaps a bit too on the nose for the media congloms to be piping into Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom and other upfronts venues. After all, no matter how hard media execs try to spin that things are fine — that’s hardly the case: Production is down, budgets keep getting slashed and studios like Paramount Global (still awaiting news on its Skydance merger) continue to be the subject of speculation about their ultimate survival.Anxiety rules this business, and yet, the show must go on. Last week NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and YouTube all promoted their broad portfolios, with varying degrees of success.Live sports are clearly still the driving factor in the conglomerates’ programming strategies, and movies are part of upfronts now. A decline in scripted programming on the broadcast networks’ fall schedules is a telling sign that the TV business continues to evolve, with some of the biggest scripted bets of next season (like “The Office” follow-up “The Paper”) going to streaming instead of the traditional Big 4.By the end of upfronts week, attendees heard so many competing pitches for their ad dollars that it was hard to keep the messages straight. But here are some of Variety’s biggest takeaways from the 2025 upfronts. Related Stories VIP+ Soundstage Expansion Now Feeling Crunch of Production Contraction Michael J. Fox Joins 'Shrinking' Season 3 as Guest Star What Recession? Popular on Variety It’s an undeniable fact: The entertainment business is in roughfinancial shape. Like the rest of the country, media companies have been affected by President Trump’s tariffs and general economic upheaval. The Peak TV era, marked by blank checks for massive tentpole productions, is over. Earnings have taken a hit. Layoffs have impacted thousands. Everyone is on the hunt for more cost-effective programming. Of course, you’d get very little sense of that had you attended the upfronts. Save for a scant few passing mentions, you’d have no idea that Hollywood is facing these economic choppy times.Martin Short told the audience at Disney’s presentation that “there’s no tariffs on standing ovations,” earning a guffaw, while one Fox exec at the Manhattan Center told the crowd, “The winds of change continue to sweep through our industry and our economy.”That’s about it for mentions of anything to do with the economy this upfronts week. Understandably, media companies don’t want to scare advertisers with lots of doom and gloom. Much of TV is about escapism, after all. But completely ignoring reality is not the best policy either.Scripted Purge on Broadcast Scripted programming took a big hit on the broadcast networks this upfronts season. With the release of the fall schedules, nearly all of the major broadcasters have shifted their focus to unscripted programming and sports.The numbers don’t lie: ABC will have only five hours of scripted programming a week in the fall. Fox will have four. NBC canceled five scripted shows, with virtually no pilots in the works to replace them. CBS was the only network that committed heavily to more scripted shows, but even those were mostly spinoffs (sorry, “universe expansions”). Those included “Sheriff Country,” “Boston Blue,” “CIA” and “Y: Marshals.”Scripted shows cost more to make, and the broadcast networks aren’t drawing nearly as many customers as streamers. And there was never any doubt NBC was going to eventize the return of NBA coverage on the network.But if there’s one thing broadcast can do well, it’s weekly procedurals and broad comedies. Both formats continue to be popular, but the networks don’t seem in any rush to find the next big show.One thing’s for sure — the nostalgia reboot/revival wave has officially crashed. NBC axed “Suits LA” after just one season, despite the original show’s massive streaming success. The network also canceled the “Night Court” follow-up with Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette after three seasons, even though it started out strong in the ratings. Maybe it’s time for some original ideas to get their time in the spotlight? What’s in a Name? Whomever media companies are paying to come up with the names for new platforms deserves either a raise or a demotion. A major theme of the upfronts was branding or rebranding (or re-re-branding, in one case) with names that lacked creativity.Among the top stories of the week, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed that Max would be known as HBO Max … again. Two years after the David Zaslav regime dropped the HBO part of its streaming service’s name, HBO boss Casey Bloys announced onstage that “HBO Max” was back — earning a wide range of reactions, from laughter to applause. It could have been worse. They could have gone with Max+.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled its ESPN streaming service, which will be called … ESPN. The streamer will offer an unlimited plan that includes all ESPN networks and ESPN broadcasts on ABC for $30 a month. The irony is, that’s more than is currently offered on ESPN+. As Jimmy Kimmel put it during his annual upfront roast, “The plus is now, in many ways, a minus.”Finally there is Versant, the spinoff of NBC-Universal that will house cable brands like USA Network, Syfy, E!, CNBC and MSNBC. Aside from the fact that no one can tell you what “Versant” means, the name lacks the pop of SpinCo, the moniker the company used before someone landed on its official name.“We Come to This Place for Ad Sales” It’s official — movies are as much a part of upfronts as TV. While upfronts were once exclusively about television shows, feature films now play a major role in media company pitches to advertisers.NBCUniversal, for the second year in a row, spent a lot of time talking up “Wicked” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good.” Donna Langley, chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, and director Jon M. Chu both took the stage to hype the sequel and reveal trailers and a musical special coming to NBC. Not only that, but ad sales chief Mark Marshall made his entrance from the rafters dressed in a Glinda-inspired pink suit.Amazon’s upfront featured appearances by John Cena, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who talked up their upcoming films with Prime Video. Courtenay Valenti, Amazon’s head of theatrical and streaming film, hit the stage to delve into the film slate. She talked about Amazon’s “Thomas Crown Affair” reboot with Michael B. Jordan — with Jordan himself coming out to reveal a series spinoff of the “Creed” film franchise.Over at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront, the company devoted a big portion of its presentation to James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios. In fairness, that included DC TV shows like “Peacemaker” Season 2 and the upcoming “Lanterns,” but it also had Gunn, Safran and Shaquille O’Neal revealing a brand-new trailer for Gunn’s “Superman” movie.While companies are all about showing off their entire portfolios to advertisers, it’s still jarring to see that TV is only a portion of the upfronts experience now. Sports, Sports, Sports Sports programming has always been a major factor at the upfronts, but never more so than now. Linear TV still has the edge when it comes to live sports, and outlets like NBC are making the most of that. The broadcaster made its 11- year deal for NBA and WNBA rights a central part of its upfront, bringing out multiple current stars and revealing that Michael Jordan will be part of the network’s basketball coverage.Other traditional TV outlets, in an effort to stave off live sports gains made by streamers, have gone all in not just on major players like the NFL, the NBA and the NHL, but also on basically any sports rights deal they can get their hands on. College-level sports of all kinds and smaller leagues got their time in the spotlight. But streamers made their sports presence felt more than ever. YouTube will livestream an NFL game for free in 2025. Amazon and Netflix announced major games for “Thursday Night Football” and the Christmas Day doubleheader, respectively. Netflix got NFL commissioner Roger Goodell onstage (in a Santa coat, no less) to announce the 2025 Christmas surprise.Of course, not all the sports moments were highlight reel-worthy. At Fox’s presentation, Tom Brady somehow missed an easy pass to Rob Gronkowski, with the ball sailing into the crowd, while Blake Griffin got smoked in a Pop-a-Shot shoot-off against former NFL star Ryan Fitzpatrick Upfronts Report Card Amazon Grade: ABest star moment: Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger going off scriptBest pitch: Michael B.

Title: H-1B demand hits three-year low amid US crackdowns, tech layoffs

A total of 358,737 applications were received this year—down from over 480,000 last year—making it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration’s “America First” and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump’s previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. “As companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,” said Sharma. “Employers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.” Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. “The L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,” she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. “If the economic climate improves and there’s a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,” she said.

Title: Blog: Whatever Happened To 'Working From Home'? Why Your Boss Wants You Back In Office

Time Published: 2025-05-20T13:30:18Z

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about “fauxductivity” - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of £7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers.

While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves. A Qatari official told CNN the plane would be a 'gift to the Pentagon', a 'government-to-government transaction' that will then be 'donated' to Trump's presidential library. On February 20, 2025, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed to be a KGB officer, made the most fantastic of Facebook posts - that in 1987 Russia recruited a then 40-year-old Donald Trump as an 'intelligence asset'. On board the rocket was EOS-9, designed to provide continuous and reliable remote sensing data for operational applications across various sectors. For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals. Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza has entered its most intense phase yet with the expansion of Operation Gideon's Chariot. If Tim Cook complies with Trump's plan, the US President's "little problem" might translate into a big problem The man was walking away from me, about 100-150 metres away. I shouted out his name. He stopped, but didn't turn. The muzzles of at least half a dozen AK-47s were pointed at me.

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks
URL: https://time.com/7286691/business-roundtable-mia-trumps-attacks/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T19:42:20Z
Full Content:
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

ByExpert Panel® ByExpert Panel®, Forbes Councils Member. To a layperson, technology and biological life may seem like opposite poles. However, the tech industry regularly draws lessons from living organisms, striving to build tools and systems that not only learn, adapt and evolve—like artificial intelligence—but can also make decisions and take action in real time, as humans do. From neural networks to swarm robotics, many of today’s most sophisticated technologies are inspired by the natural functions and collective behavior of living organisms. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share compelling real-world examples of “living intelligence” technologies, as well as natural creatures and phenomena that are inspiring adaptive tech systems and tools. Read on to learn what the convergence of nature and technology signals for the future of humanity. As a cancer scientist, I use digital AI technology to analyze cancer tissue slides. I am impressed that this innovative technology can predict immune cell types with spatial context. It can derive thousands of features that human eyes can’t see. I can see a gold mine in front of us—some of these features can be groundbreaking in detecting cancer and predicting the outcomes of therapies. - Rachel Tam, Bristol Myers Squibb Starlings exemplify one of nature’s most mesmerizing displays of swarm intelligence in action. Their behavior demonstrates how simple sets of localized rules can give rise to complex collective phenomena. This natural model has applications in modeling complex systems through simple interaction rules, giving rise to emergent properties and behaviors that are otherwise difficult to simulate holistically. - Anuradha Weeraman, Verdentra Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? Neuralink’s brain-computer interface, which enables a person with quadriplegia to control devices with their thoughts, is stunning. It’s living intelligence merging AI and biotech to restore personal autonomy. Implications include revolutionizing healthcare and enhancing human capabilities—but it also raises ethical questions about privacy and cognitive augmentation. - Lori Schafer, Digital Wave Technology Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot, which can autonomously navigate complex terrains, is a powerful example of living intelligence in action. Its ability to adapt in real time mirrors biological instinct. The broader implication? AI and robotics are evolving from scripted automation to embodied cognition, unlocking transformative potential in defense, disaster response and industry. - Srinivasa Rao Bittla, Adobe Inc. One real-world example of living intelligence that impressed me is DeepMind’s AlphaFold. It accurately predicted protein structures, solving a 50-year-old challenge in biology. This breakthrough accelerates drug discovery and disease understanding—a glimpse into AI’s potential to revolutionize science and healthcare. - Akhilesh Sharma, A3Logics Inc. AI-powered satellite imagery analysis for deforestation monitoring has impressed me. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the Global Forest Watch project has improved accuracy and speed in detecting forest loss. This highlights the potential for AI to drive environmental sustainability and inform policy decisions, ultimately contributing to more effective conservation efforts. - Pooja Jain, Meta (Facebook) A compelling example of living intelligence in cloud and DevOps is Netflix’s Chaos Engineering platform, which simulates real-world failures to proactively test system resilience. This intelligent, self-healing infrastructure ensures uptime and performance at scale, highlighting how AI-driven automation and observability can revolutionize system reliability and DevOps maturity. - Hrushikesh Deshmukh, Fannie Mae One of the most interesting cases is one developed by Alibaba Cloud. “ET City Brain” monitors the entire traffic flow of the city of Hangzhou, China, in real time, analyzing cameras, sensors, GPS and traffic lights in order to optimize circulation and reduce traffic jams. Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barberá Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature’s teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros—all without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature’s “dumb” systems often outsmart centralized control—sometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks—the “wood-wide web”—fascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems—an insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla’s self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data. Their neural network adapts continuously, making decisions that improve over time. This dynamic AI system is transforming transportation and holds broad implications for industries like healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, offering new potential for automation and efficiency. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The human brain’s ability to recognize patterns and make decisions is a prime example of living intelligence that has deeply influenced the field of artificial intelligence. The brain’s ability to process complex data through interconnected neurons, for instance, has inspired the development of neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing. - Udit Mehrotra, Amazon Urban crows in Japan drop nuts onto crosswalks, timing traffic to crack shells and safely retrieve food—an elegant display of living intelligence improvising and adapting to an urban environment. Crows offer inspiration for AI and robotics: context-aware, adaptive and seamlessly integrated with human infrastructure. - Amy Gu, Dynamsoft Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology stands out as a prime example of living intelligence within the e-commerce field. The system enables customers to purchase items without waiting in lines by integrating AI technology with sensors and computer vision. The retail industry is being transformed through this seamless shopping experience toward fully autonomous and personalized, frictionless retail commerce. - Amit Ojha One real-world example of living intelligence is autonomous threat detection in financial networks using AI and behavioral analytics. I have seen systems flag and isolate anomalies in real time, without human intervention. The broader impact is clear: It proves that living intelligence can adapt, learn continuously and defend complex environments with speed and precision. - Srikanth Bellamkonda Over 10 years ago, Zappos impressed me with a smart checkout prompt: After I ordered shoes, its system suggested rubber boots because of the rain forecast around my delivery date. It blended personal context with weather data—a great early example of living intelligence, long before the likes of ChatGPT normalized the use of AI. - Agur Jõgi, Pipedrive A standout example of living intelligence is Costa Group’s use of computer-vision-powered robotic pollinators in tomato greenhouses. In place of bees, these AI-driven robots improved yield by up to 15%. This showcases how smart automation can solve ecological and regulatory challenges, opening doors for sustainable, tech-enabled agriculture worldwide. - Tarun Eldho Alias, Neem Inc. Humans are being inspired by slime mold's strategic mastery. Physarum polycephalum is a brainless single-celled organism that can solve mazes and optimize nutrient pathways, challenging our notions of intelligence. Its ability to make decisions and adapt to complex environments suggests cognition may be more distributed than we think. It’s inspiring developments in decentralized computing, robotics and urban planning. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies An AI tool that analyzes credit risk adapts to real-time life events like layoffs or health bills. Analyzing nontraditional signals can redefine lending fairness. This living intelligence bridges empathy and economics, hinting at a future where automated finance tools react with humanlike instinct. - Jitender Jain

Title: AvalonBay braces for signs of trouble in DC rental market

Let Multifamily Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. CEO Ben Schall also said the softness in the REIT’s expansion markets could provide opportunities to add assets. On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. “Recognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,” Schall said on the REIT’s earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird’s-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. “Over the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,” Breslin said. “About 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.” AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here’s more on what’s happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn’t been seen in 20 years. “Our established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,” Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT’s properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. “Northern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,” Breslin said. “Performance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.” As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro’s availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB’s year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. “We'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,” Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB’s coastal markets. “While we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,” Schall said. “On the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.” In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. “These are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,” Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay’s chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. “And that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.” Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay “You think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,” Breslin said. “You look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.” AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. “As these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,” Schall said.

Title: Silicon Valley's era of open debate fades as companies clamp down on employee dissent
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107955-tech-workers-face-retaliation-companies-crack-down-protests.html

Through the looking glass: As the tech industry continues to tighten control over employee speech and activism, a culture once defined by open dialogue and political engagement gives way to one marked by silence and fear of reprisal. "It's different now; employers feel they can get away with stuff," said a former Google employee. In recent years, Silicon Valley has witnessed a sharp shift in how major technology companies respond to employee activism and internal dissent. Once known for a culture encouraging open debate and political engagement, the tech industry is now cracking down on workers who challenge company policies or voice concerns about controversial business practices. Last month, two employees who interrupted an event with founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella to protest Microsoft's involvement in the Israel-Gaza war were quickly fired. Five years ago, by contrast, Microsoft divested from an Israeli facial recognition startup suspected of surveilling Palestinian citizens, partly in response to internal pressure. Also read: Microsoft fires engineers over AI protest at 50th-anniversary event This incident is part of a larger trend in the industry. Across the tech sector, companies are increasingly rejecting worker petitions, terminating employees who organize protests, and deleting critical posts from internal forums. Internet platforms have also warned against leaking information to the media, and some workers have lost their jobs as a result. Other policies have been implemented to prevent employees from contacting regulators. Last year, some OpenAI employees filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that the company's restrictive agreements prevented staff from warning regulators about AI safety risks. At the same time, the tech labor market has undergone dramatic changes, as mass layoffs, once rare among tech giants, have become increasingly routine. Since 2023, more than half a million tech jobs have been cut, according to Layoffs.fyi. This month, Microsoft announced a 3 percent reduction in its global workforce, following similar moves by Meta and Intel. The crackdown on dissent has intensified during the presidency of Donald Trump. Executives at Google, Meta, and Amazon contributed millions to Trump's inauguration committee and have engaged with the White House in private meetings. Many companies have also introduced policies that align with the administration's agenda, such as eliminating diversity initiatives and reversing longstanding content moderation practices. These changes might once have sparked significant activism among Silicon Valley's traditionally liberal workforce. However, aggressive management tactics and a weak job market have dampened employees' willingness to speak out. "A decade ago, employees would discuss controversial political issues out in the open and on employee message boards and at all-hands meetings," said Nu Wexler, a communications consultant with experience at Google, Twitter, and Meta. Now, "the companies have either strongly discouraged that or banned it." These tactics are having their intended effect. After Google announced in February that it would no longer avoid using AI for weapons or surveillance, internal message boards remained largely silent, a stark contrast to seven years ago when thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to cancel a Pentagon contract for AI-powered drone analysis. Employees, though, have not gone completely silent. A group called No Azure for Apartheid was launched and is led by current and former Microsoft employees who are protesting the company's business dealings with the Israeli military and government. It is holding a protest this weekend. However, Microsoft has come down hard on employees participating in such protests during company time. Microsoft fired at least five employees who protested during a town hall with CEO Satya Nadella. The workers, wearing T-shirts that read "Does Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?" were part of No Azure for Apartheid. Google, too, fired more than 50 employees last year after protests against its cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government. CEO Sundar Pichai had previously warned employees not to use the company as a "personal platform" or to "fight over disruptive issues or debate politics."
