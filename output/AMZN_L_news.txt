Dozens of Amazon employees working on the retailer's book divisions have been laid off. As reported by Reuters, Amazon confirmed that it's cutting jobs across the Goodreads review site and Kindle units, which impacts fewer than 100 workers. Amazon says the recent layoffs across Goodreads and Kindle divisions are meant to improve efficiency and streamline operations. The giant retailer has constantly reduced staff across various divisions over the past few years. According to CEO Andy Jassy, reducing headcounts helps the company to eliminate bureaucracy. "As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently and to better align with our business roadmap, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization," an Amazon spokesperson said. Layoffs recently impacted employees in Amazon's Wondery podcast division, devices and services units, communications, and in-store staff. However, Amazon's Q1 results show the retailer has added about 4,000 jobs compared to Q4 2024. After the Covid pandemic settled down, many companies began laying off thousands of staff they hired during the pandemic to respond to growing demands. The layoff trend among tech firms still exists today, and AI has amplified it. The latest data shows that in 2025, about 62,832 tech employees were laid off across 141 tech companies. Also, 152,922 tech employees across 551 companies were laid off in 2024. More layoffs are expected to occur due to declining economic growth, tariffs, and the expansion of AI across companies. Amazon is also gearing up to double down in AI investments and robotics. The company has recently announced the forming of a new agentic AI team to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics. Also, a new report by The Information indicates that Amazon has begun testing humanoid robots for package delivery.

Title: PR Roundup: CEO Popularity, Wilson from Cast Away is Back, Mattel Studios

Remember Me By Nicole Schuman This week's PR Roundup looks at a new study from Morning Consult about CEO popularity and company reputation; Mattel going all in on entertainment with a new TV and film studio; and Wilson, the iconic volleyball, teaching the public about ecology and ocean waste. What happened: The American public’s relationship with CEOs is more complicated than ever. According to new data from Morning Consult, public sentiment toward top executives is sharply divided, with nearly equal numbers of U.S. adults saying they view CEOs favorably and unfavorably. The same split applies to trust: about half of respondents believe CEOs will do the right thing, while the other half aren't buying it. The findings come at a time when business leaders are increasingly stepping into the political spotlight. Consumers and employees alike are feeling the pressure and fatigue of ongoing economic uncertainty. The report also highlights how opinions about CEOs vary widely across age, income and political ideology lines, reinforcing the polarization seen in nearly every corner of public life. Key findings include: Communication takeaways: For comms pros, the message is clear: CEOs and the brands they lead must work even harder to build and keep trust. Ellyn Briggs, Brands Analyst at Morning Consult, says that the lists “underscore another important dimension of CEO public perception … oftentimes, opinions of an executive are closely tied to (or even interchangeable with) that of the company they work for.” “Case in point: Unlike Bezos or Elon Musk, Costco’s Vachris isn’t a household name or frequently making news,” she says. “And yet, because Costco is such a widely known and loved brand, he appeared as a favorite business leader for all U.S. adults and several other groups.” However, the study also notes that potential CEO-related risk increases with an increase in publicity. Briggs cites Tesla co-founder Musk in this case. “Since … Musk began inserting himself into divisive political and cultural conversations, several of the electric vehicle maker’s brand metrics, including favorability, purchase consideration and sales, have steeply declined,” she says. And if a CEO screws up once—take Martha Stewart, for example, and the insider trading debacle—companies can still recover. But when a CEO is constantly in the news for crises, that’s tough for any PR pro to overcome when it comes to consumer sentiment. What happened: The world’s most iconic volleyball, that you may remember from the movie “Cast Away,” is helping to tell the story of climate change. Ahead of the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference comes The Odyssey of Wilson, a powerful sustainability campaign that turns real UNESCO oceanographic data into an immersive, 450-year journey that sheds light on the devastating impact of plastic pollution on our oceans. Viewers of the campaign can follow Wilson’s imagined path through the world’s oceans as a metaphor for the long-term deterioration caused by plastics. The experience traces currents, tides and climate events to visualize the volleyball’s transformation into microplastics—witnessing acidification, ice shelf collapse and rising sea levels along the way. According to UNESCO, between 1.1 and 4.9 million tons of plastic are already present in the ocean. Communication Takeaways: Led by the Onda Azul Institute, with technological support from telecom giant Vivo, the campaign transforms complex, sobering data into a story that resonates emotionally and urges action. It’s a prime example of how to make difficult concepts—in this case, high level scientific data—accessible to the regular consumer. “This project is about making science human,” says André Luis Esteves, Executive Director at the Onda Azul Institute. “By following the journey of a simple object, we illustrate decades of invisible damage caused by plastic waste—and why it urgently needs global attention. We’ve transformed data into a story people can feel.” Africa Creative, known for bold storytelling and purpose-driven campaigns, led creative development for the campaign. The integrated effort includes an immersive digital platform to explore the journey, a short film, public installations in coastal cities and live activations during major sports broadcasts. “Science alone doesn’t move people—stories do,” says Raphael Vandystadt, VP of Sustainability at Africa Creative. “By turning complex data into a powerful visual journey, we help make the invisible visible. Communication plays a strategic role in mobilizing collective action for our oceans.” What happened: While the entertainment industry seems to be on a downswing as several companies, including Disney and NBCUniversal, announced layoffs this week, some brands are going all-in on entertainment content. Toymaker Mattel, the home of Barbie, announced it would combine its TV and film divisions this week to form a complete studio. As you may recall, the “Barbie” movie became a summer 2023 blockbuster smash, grossing more than $1.4 billion in worldwide box office sales. It also received nine Oscar nominations. According to Reuters, Mattel also plans future releases to include "Masters of the Universe," “a live-action film inspired by the He-Man action figures, and "Matchbox," based on its miniature cars,” as well as a possible Polly Pocket movie. Communication takeaways: Mattel’s announcement yesterday showcases a clear turn for brands. They are no longer just advertisers—they’re becoming their own entertainment companies. James DeJulio, CEO of Tongal, a longtime Mattel partner and award-winning creator platform, believes that in-house comms must operate like content studios to stay culturally relevant. “Mattel’s move … is just the latest signal that brands are no longer content to sit on the sidelines of storytelling,” DeJulio says. “It’s about owning the narrative. For communications teams, this marks a critical turning point. To stay competitive and culturally relevant, in-house comms functions must evolve into modern content engines—developing and distributing original content that extends brand messaging far beyond press releases and earned media. Podcasts, newsletters, social video and fan-first storytelling are no longer “nice-to-haves”—they’re the new baseline.” Nicole Schuman is Managing Editor at PRNEWS. Find a Job | Post a Job

Title: Why Microsoft has created its own print magazine

Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. by Tom Warren Of all the many ways Microsoft could mark its 50th anniversary, I wasn’t expecting the software maker to launch a magazine. “It’s our answer to a timely question: How do we earn trust and hold attention in an age of scroll and skim? How do we create Signal in a world of noise?” asks Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer. Microsoft’s response to a world of people doomscrolling on X and TikTok is a print magazine that you can thumb through in peace and quiet. The first issue of Signal is 120 pages with a focus on AI, both as a topic and, to a small degree, a means of production. Microsoft hopes the magazine will bypass the digital world and reach business leaders directly every few months. “People are overloaded with information, and a lot of the information is pretty ephemeral,” says Steve Clayton, the executive editor of Signal, in an interview for Notepad. “[Signal is] partly a reaction to that, which is: how do we create something that’s more thoughtful and has some more permanence, and is a bit longer-lasting than a five-second TikTok video?” Signal looks like any high-quality magazine you’d find at a newsstand, complete with deep dives on Microsoft technologies, interviews with Microsoft executives, and some lighthearted quiz and trivia sections to round off the magazine format. It’s a magazine from Microsoft’s comms team, so don’t expect to read anything about Amazon or Google in here, or material that strays beyond a clean and tidy image of Microsoft. Instead, you’ve got guest appearances from CEO Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates in the premiere issue I’ve read. The deeper stories on Microsoft will look very familiar to anyone who has read Microsoft’s Source work, where the company writes its own stories about how its technology is being used throughout the world. These digital stories are a good reminder of how influential Microsoft is, but they’re not yarns that the company can easily pitch to journalists like me because they’re simply too self-promotional. Signal feels like a physical manifestation of Microsoft’s strategy with its Source stories. “Microsoft Source and Microsoft stories has been our opportunity to go direct,” says Clayton. Microsoft has printed 1,500 copies of Signal that it’s distributing at its own business-focused events. “Fifteen hundred is a good place to start, and the uptake has been really good. There’s been a lot of demand for it,” says Clayton. “If we get through those and see more demand that we can’t fulfill, then we’ll go and do another print run.” The publication schedule is still in flux as Microsoft gauges interest. “We’re starting to think about what the next few editions will be, and based on the reaction to this one, that will determine the size of the next print run,” says Clayton. Microsoft didn’t want to print 15,000 and have them sitting on shelves at its events, so it’s treading carefully for now with plans to publish every quarter or so. A big inspiration for Signal was the Costco magazine that’s distributed to millions of members every month, a reach that makes it one of the largest magazines in the country and a steady way for the retailer to reach its customers. “The facility, the team, and production that they’d set up, we have a lot of that capability already, so it was an opportunity for us to turn our attention to a new thing,” says Clayton. Costco mails out more than 15 million copies of its magazine with each issue, but Microsoft isn’t expecting to scale Signal to those heights yet. “I don’t think we’re going to go and compete with Costco’s magazine anytime soon, put it that way,” says Clayton. Signal, as you might expect, is very focused on how Microsoft’s technology is being used by businesses. That means it’s also very much focused on AI. I counted mentions on more than 50 of its 120 pages. There’s a story about a women’s soccer team in Spain that was recently promoted and grappled with the use of AI, a deep dive into how Vodafone is deploying AI, and another piece on how Microsoft’s research labs are using AI for science. There are also parts of Signal that look more clearly like promotional material for companies using Microsoft technology, or the types of customer stories that wouldn’t interest readers of The Verge. But there are also interesting, meatier stories. The Vodafone piece might sound like pure marketing, but I could see how it might be useful as a less technical guide for other CTOs thinking about rolling out AI. Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant helped build small parts of the first issue of Signal, but it’s unclear how deep that’ll go in story creation in future issues. “We certainly didn’t go in intentionally and say that we’re going to have an AI-generated story,” says Clayton. “At the back of the magazine there’s a small quiz that’s generated by Copilot, so you could argue that piece is generated by AI.” Clayton also says he used the deep research functionality of Copilot to help develop Microsoft’s periodic table. “I definitely see us using AI to help us do some of the research and production, and I think we’re open to what we can do with AI in the magazine, but it’s not something that’s front and center,” he says. Microsoft has been working with the Slow Journalism Company in the UK to help produce Signal. “I’ve long been a fan of their work and they were a big help in writing some of the pieces as well, and we’ll continue to work with them,” says Clayton. “They have great writing and editorial talent, and also they just know how to produce a magazine.” Learning how to create a magazine has been a big part of Microsoft’s experiment with Signal. A magazine has to have lighter pieces of content, and it all needs to be arranged in a compelling way to keep readers engaged. There’s a fine art to keep people turning a page in a magazine that’s different from getting someone to click on an online piece. I’ve enjoyed reading Signal, especially the soccer piece and the 50-year anniversary stories. Like any magazine there are parts I could happily skip over, but the design, attention to detail, and stories here are surprising for Microsoft’s first issue. I’m very curious to see whether a trend back to print emerges across other tech companies, and how many hands Signal actually ends up in. I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

Title: American workers in peril: How 1 foreign government is engineering largest U.S. job loss ever

By Amanda Bartolotta June 5, 2025 It’s no secret that massive layoffs are currently devastating American workers. While industries across the spectrum are affected, from retail to manufacturing, the hardest-hit area is America’s tech sector, with companies from Amazon to Microsoft to Meta cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs – over 23,400 tech jobs cut in April alone. While automation and AI are conveniently blamed, hardcore reality comes into view when companies routinely cite “cost-cutting” and “corporate restructuring” – phrases that are often euphemisms for laying off American workers while hiring more foreign workers at lower wages. At the same time, the government of India is openly celebrating the launch of its latest scheme to supercharge the export of Indian workers to the U.S. and other “high-income economies.” Its goal is to facilitate the global mobility and employment of millions of migrant Indian workers directly at the expense of jobs for Americans. Not just immigration, but a global labor-export campaign Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! India’s “Global Access to Talent from India” initiative, or GATI, launched May 6, was personally championed by India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other officials who essentially describe it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redirect jobs, wages and even long-term industry trends away from Americans and into the pockets of India’s government, its outsourcing giants and their international partners. Calling this a “now or never” moment, India warns that the window of demographic advantage could close as competition mounts from African nations, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and Brazil, all vying for their own share of the global labor market. Referring to a November 2024 think-tank report by two India-based entities, which projects a “global labor gap” of 45-50 million jobs in high-income countries by 2030, GATI sees a huge opportunity to flood foreign markets with its mass population to enter the global workforce. The document outlines a goal of doubling or even tripling the annual outflow of Indian workers, aiming for a “potential stock” of millions of Indian migrant workers overseas. But the ambition doesn’t end there. India is positioning itself as a “geostrategic partner” for major economies, hoping to be recognized as the world’s “trusted migration partner” and rebranding its citizens as a global “talent brand.” GATI predicts this “talent gap” could expand dramatically over the next two decades. Behind this bold new push, India has developed a structured and aggressive multi-horizon strategy to unlock its overseas labor potential. Through a combination of diaspora influence, bilateral negotiations, demand-side positioning, skill alignment and financing mechanisms, India calls for a “whole-of-nation” effort to coordinate the mass movement of workers abroad, treating its citizens as a strategic export. At the same time, Jaishankar demands that destination countries eliminate their own protections and reshape their laws to accommodate this outflow. This is not about mutual benefit, but about using foreign labor markets to solve India’s unemployment and economic growth crises. Outbound movement, remittance inflow Thus, by its own admission, GATI has engineered a massive, state-backed campaign to export Indian labor on a scale never before seen. This isn’t just about creating new job opportunities for Indians, it’s about systematically opening foreign markets, expanding India’s labor supply and building a permanent ecosystem that channels workers – and wages – out of America and into India. According to a leader of one of the report’s contributors, the India-based Boston Consulting Group, India’s labor exports could grow to as many as 2.5 million workers per year. Reality check: This is not a workforce solution for the United States. Indian officials publicly celebrate the higher wages their workers earn overseas, calling it “transformative” for India’s economy, while U.S. companies line up to replace Americans with cheaper, more compliant foreign labor. The result is a hollowing out of America’s middle class, not a win-win for both countries. What’s unfolding in America is not an isolated series of layoffs, but rather a deliberate, top-down overhaul of the U.S. labor market, designed by Indian policymakers, embraced by corporate America and propelled by relentless lobbying for ever more visas. In fact, the GATI Foundation openly targets $300 billion in annual remittances, money siphoned from American paychecks and communities, to be spent and invested back in India. India’s leaders make no secret of their endgame to use public-private partnerships to streamline recruitment, training and job placement for Indian nationals, maximizing remittance flows and strengthening India’s economic influence abroad. These remittance inflows have become a critical pillar of India’s economic strategy, pumping billions back into the country every year. Through GATI, India now aggressively markets itself as the world’s “reliable labor supplier,” positioning outbound migration as a strategic national asset. Unfortunately, the true impact of all this is that every job handed to an Indian guest worker is one lost to an American family. Through the GATI Foundation’s deep network of corporate partners, India is lobbying for looser visa rules and making Indian worker preference the “new normal” in major U.S. industries. Meanwhile, American companies are increasingly outsourcing everything from recruitment to training directly to Indian partners, ensuring that foreign nationals fill key roles while qualified U.S. citizens are left behind. Thus, at its core, the GATI Foundation’s blueprint is not about helping Americans or remedying genuine labor shortages, but about exploiting loopholes in U.S. immigration policy and leveraging global labor narratives to cement India’s rise, at the direct expense of the American workforce. The real agenda behind ‘Global Talent Shortage’ The GATI Foundation was created to exploit what India calls a “demand-supply mismatch” in global labor markets. Citing projections that labor shortages in high-income countries could reach 250 million in 25 years, India pitches itself as the answer, if only Western nations open their doors to millions of Indian workers. The GATI Report frames this supposed crisis as an economic certainty, pushing the narrative that countries like the U.S. and Europe must ramp up labor migration or face disaster. But this narrative falls apart on closer inspection. These “shortage” projections ignore millions of Americans and Westerners who have been forced out of the workforce by layoffs, offshoring and corporate cost-cutting. The “labor gap” is little more than an accounting trick, counting open positions that employers refuse to fill at fair wages and normal working conditions. Instead of investing in local workers, companies push for visas to import cheaper labor. And India stands ready to supply it. The contradiction is glaring: GATI and its supporters claim automation and “Gen AI” are both eliminating jobs and creating labor shortages at the same time. It’s a manufactured crisis, a narrative designed to benefit global corporations and foreign governments, but not American families. In truth, India’s campaign isn’t about filling genuine labor gaps, but about lobbying for new visa categories, higher caps and direct government-to-government deals to force open “mature” markets like the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. The GATI Report itself concedes that in these countries, mass inflows are possible only if their governments change laws and visa policies – not because the market demands it, but because India’s lobby demands it. After all, if there truly were a dire worker shortage, existing visa programs would be flooded with qualified applicants and positions would fill quickly. Instead, India is manufacturing demand by lobbying for new pathways and is using its diplomatic muscle to export its unemployment crisis and the “remittance gold rush” that comes with it, into Western economies. As detailed in India’s own 2024 Employment Report, India’s job creation is not keeping pace with its exploding youth population. Far from being a demographic advantage, this so-called dividend is a growing liability, with millions of educated young Indians unable to find work at home. But Jaishankar and the rest of India’s leadership are not merely describing labor trends; they’re demanding permanent, government-backed pipelines to move Indian workers into foreign markets, shifting the costs and consequences onto the United States and its citizens. The so-called “global talent shortage” is not a fact of economics, but a tool of policy – propaganda crafted to dismantle labor protections, depress American wages and entrench the power of foreign governments and multinationals, all at the expense of the American worker. The skills mirage: India’s talent shortage cover-up India promotes its vast, English-speaking workforce as the solution to the so-called global talent shortage, marketing the GATI scheme as a direct pipeline of world-class professionals. In truth, GATI is engineered to move as many people abroad as possible, papering over the persistent problems of quality, skills and employability that continue to plague India’s workforce. Leaders like Jaishankar champion “skill development” and “global mobility,” but India’s own data reveals the reality: Fewer than half of Indian postgraduates are employable by international standards, according to India’s Skill Reports. This isn’t about quality; it’s about numbers. Thus, billions are funneled into crash courses, language bootcamps and certifications, not to build genuine expertise, but to create a façade of qualification, often after jobs have already been promised overseas. Even in crucial sectors like healthcare, where Jaishankar boasts India can “solve” Western shortages, the fact remains: India struggles to meet its own domestic needs. Skill reports and experts like Dr. Lekha Chakraborty confirm that Indian training programs consistently fail to prepare graduates for real-world demands, leaving millions underserved and resources misallocated. Yet, rather than closing the skill gaps at home, the focus is on exporting as many workers as possible, regardless of whether they actually meet international standards. The reality is, India isn’t overflowing with world-class professionals; it’s overflowing with people. Thus, the Indian government’s real objective is to wedge as many Indian nationals as possible into good-paying American jobs, often regardless of true qualification or the local impact. Meanwhile, capable American workers are left behind, not due to a lack of ability, but because U.S. policymakers and corporations have bought into India’s narrative and abandoned investment in the American workforce. The hidden cost of investing in India’s labor-supply strategy India has built a vast financial infrastructure to facilitate outbound migration, offering bridging loans, insurance and rotating funds, all subsidized by public and private grants. For employers, it’s cheaper to bring in Indian nationals than to invest in their own workforce. But the GATI strategy doesn’t stop at financing. India is demanding that host countries overhaul their own labor systems to accommodate and protect incoming foreign workers. Grievance mechanisms, legal mandates and resource centers lock in rights for migrants, while incentives including low-interest business loans and reskilling support are used to tilt hiring toward foreign workers. The hidden costs are staggering. American workers are not only undercut by lower-paid foreign labor, but are forced to compete with a workforce backed by another nation’s government and a web of corporate allies. Meanwhile, U.S. training standards and credential requirements are undermined, eroding the value of American education and experience. This isn’t a temporary fix. It is a permanent, self-reinforcing system, channeling billions of dollars in remittances to India and institutionalizing foreign-worker preference in advanced economies. The outcome is inevitable: falling wages, lost jobs and a steady erosion of America’s sovereignty over its own workforce. Every dollar invested in this supply strategy is a dollar stolen from the American economy. It’s time to demand a course correction, one that puts American skills, livelihoods and interests first. Hiring from India is like signing a contract riddled with hidden clauses; by the time the consequences are clear, the damage is done. The American workforce deserves better. Those jobs belong to American workers, not a foreign government’s export strategy. A blueprint for displacement: India’s cold, calculated framework India’s own analysis admits Indian certifications often aren’t recognized overseas due to mismatched skill requirements and quality standards – a clear sign that many of the workers being pushed abroad are not actually qualified for the jobs at hand. To get around these constraints, India’s plan is to “harmonize demand-centric skilling,” lobbying for international recognition of Indian credentials and pushing for government-backed loans to subsidize outbound migration. The goal isn’t to meet genuine needs, but to bypass local standards and flood foreign markets, regardless of the consequences for host countries. Every time a visa barrier is lowered or a new guest worker program is launched, it opens the door for India to embed even more of its surplus labor in Western economies. But the ambitions don’t stop with white-collar tech jobs. India’s leaders are playing a much longer and more aggressive game, openly targeting blue-collar visa categories like H-2A and H-2B, sectors that have long provided stability for American families and local communities. Their policy documents make this crystal clear: India’s strategy is to steadily lobby for the removal of visa caps, to institutionalize so-called “circular migration” so Indian workers can cycle through U.S. jobs indefinitely and to push for changes in immigration law that make Indian labor the default option for both high- and low-skill roles. This is not a temporary workforce solution; it’s a step-by-step plan to permanently transform the American labor market in ways that serve India’s interests while sidelining American workers at every level. America’s future: At a crossroads Bottom line: As American companies outsource everything from recruitment to onboarding to Indian partners, foreign nationals are funneled into critical roles across tech, healthcare, engineering and more, frequently at the direct expense of U.S. citizens. Accreditation standards are diluted. Worker protections are eroded. The playing field is tilted. India’s GATI initiative does not represent an invitation for partnership; it serves as a stark warning. As Indian leaders openly coordinate, lobby and strategize to gain a foothold in U.S. job markets, too many American officials remain silent or, worse, actively complicit. Every so-called “strategic migration partnership” and each new visa pipeline laid is another brick in the wall separating American families from their own economic future. The stakes could not be higher. This is not a tale of isolated layoffs or routine workforce shifts, but a deliberate, foreign-led transformation of the U.S. labor market. It is sold as progress but experienced as loss in every community facing layoffs, stagnant wages and vanishing careers. Each time an American worker is replaced by a lower-paid Indian “guest worker,” it marks another victory for India’s national agenda and another defeat for the American middle class. Unless action is taken, this pattern will only accelerate. American laws, corporations and policymakers risk becoming tools for India’s economic ascent while the American dream is steadily outsourced and rewritten. Americans must demand that their leaders defend their interests by rejecting foreign lobbying, putting an end to corporate collusion that enables mass visa fraud and restoring a workforce system that prioritizes American citizens in their own country. The choice is clear. Either the United States reclaims its labor market, its laws and its future, or the nation will continue down a path where its greatest export is its own prosperity. History will not be kind to those who allowed this nation to be given away. Now is the time to draw the line: America first, in every job, every industry, and every decision. Otherwise, America’s children will no longer compete with the “world” for the American dream – because that dream will belong to India. Editor’s note: This story is one of the most important currently facing Americans – yet outside of WND, it is almost entirely unreported. For years, WND has warned about the dangers of unchecked immigration and global labor schemes. Now, in real time, Americans are witnessing a foreign government making its final, strategic move to overtake their nation, one visa at a time. WND cannot win this battle alone. With your voice, support and vigilance, we can make sure America’s future is decided by Americans, not by foreign interests. Follow us, share this investigation and join the fight to keep America first.

Title: The Great Quack Revival

Six months into the second Trump administration, it has become clear that now is the time of con men. Scams and snake oil proliferate, as do the hucksters who promote them. Before Mike Huckabee became our ambassador to Israel, he advertised Relaxium, an herbal supplement whose makers falsely pledged it would help a restless nation sleep. Other supplement-makers see a champion in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who not only opposes vaccines but has said the Food and Drug Administration should free the nation from the “aggressive suppression” of dubious vitamins and herbal substances. Kennedy has even hired David Geier to conduct a study into the debunked link between autism and vaccines, though authorities once punished Geier for experimenting on autistic children in a basement laboratory. Like his late father, Mark, Geier believes the puberty blocker Lupron can treat autism and says vaccines caused the developmental condition. Neither claim is true, but in the greater Make America Healthy Again universe, facts can be inconvenient. Dubious supplements and false cures have always been part of the quack’s tool kit, but Kennedy and his ilk aren’t limiting themselves to the mere promotion of pseudoscience. They’re attacking scientific research at the same time. Funding cuts and layoffs are weakening major institutions like the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, which were established to monitor our food supply and medicines for safety. The administration has canceled research grants to universities, slowing the pace of innovation. Scientists searching for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, various cancers, and genetic diseases say their work is in jeopardy — if it can continue at all. The MAHA war on expertise leaves Americans ever more vulnerable to predators and scams, which in turn exacerbates a much older problem: The quack has too much power and prospers in times of inequality and mistrust. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found 86 percent of Americans felt confident in the work of the country’s scientists. That figure declined during the pandemic, and though it rebounded slightly by 2024, it remains lower than its pre-COVID levels. Behind the numbers are hucksters who prospered during the pandemic thanks in part to Donald Trump himself. Although the president’s first term oversaw the rapid development of COVID vaccines, Trump also told people to inject disinfectant to fight the virus. Grifters peddled ivermectin, a horse dewormer, along with an anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine, which is not an effective COVID treatment. Trump would later tout it at a press conference, leading to fatal consequences for at least one listener. Hydroxychloroquine sounds a lot like chloroquine, a non-pharmaceutical chemical sold to clean fish tanks. An Arizona couple had purchased the substance to treat their koi pond and decided to drink it after tuning in to Trump’s performance. The wife lived; her husband did not. Meanwhile, luminaries like the disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker sold colloidal silver as a COVID remedy. There is no evidence that colloidal silver can treat any physical ailment or that ivermectin has a use beyond the elimination of parasites. Yet people still take them, often to their own detriment. Scott Adams, the right-wing creator of “Dilbert,” recently admitted he had used ivermectin to treat his prostate cancer. It didn’t work, and Adams says he expects to die from the disease this summer. Amy Carlson, the QAnon-adjacent cult leader better known as Mother God, consumed so much colloidal silver that her skin had turned blue by the time she died. Both discovered what scientists and physicians already knew: Quackery may promise good health, but it can’t make good on its pledge. At best, it does nothing; at worst, it kills. Despite this, quacks endure, and so does the risk they pose to public health. If MAHA sweeps the scientific Establishment aside, history suggests a wild and dangerous era awaits. Quackery is at least as old as the United States itself. Frontier life promised all sorts of dangers, and early settlers brought bizarre therapeutics with them to stave off fever and premature death. Unscrupulous apothecaries and makers of nostrums, as quack medicines are sometimes known, discovered a lucrative new market that alarmed professionals with medical training. In The Toadstool Millionaires, historian James Harvey Young quotes one colonial physician who suggested a “licensing system” that would “remove the ‘Shoemakers, Weavers, and Almanack-Makers, with their virtuous Consorts, who have laid aside the proper Business of their Lives, to turn Quacks.’” But profit beckoned, and quacks proliferated for many decades to come, though they achieved no results worth mentioning. In the 18th century, the Connecticut physician Elisha Perkins devised a pair of “metallic tractors,” or rods, that could allegedly cure painful ailments like rheumatism and generated a brief international mania. The Connecticut Medical Society expelled Perkins for nostrum-making, but he persisted, convinced of his own genius. When yellow fever struck New York City in 1799, he went out to treat the sick with a mixture of “marine salt, vinegar, and water” until he inevitably fell ill, died, and was buried in a potter’s field near what is now Washington Square Park. During the Gilded Age, the growth of the newspaper industry, the rise of public advertising, and the construction of railroads coincided with radical social and economic inequality — a complex situation that nostrum-makers could and did exploit. In one extreme case, Henry T. Helmbold spread word of “buchu,” a plant native to southern Africa, along the length of the Union Pacific Railroad. The bold advertising strategy worked, and Helmbold became a wealthy eccentric who enjoyed ruling-class patronage for years. In New York, his “Temple of Pharmacy” boasted “sarcophagus soda fountains, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, monogrammed gas globes, marble floors with the doctor’s initials inlaid in brass, fountains for dispensing perfume, and canary birds tweeting in their cages,” Young wrote. Temple attendants in elaborate uniforms sold buchu to Boss Tweed and John Jacob Astor. The problem? Buchu didn’t work, and Helmbold was an alcoholic. The temple closed, the birds died, and then so did Helmbold, in 1892. Helmbold courted the rich while other quacks pursued the poor. In the years before Helmbold constructed his temple, the Philadelphia nostrum-maker William Swaim sold a “panacea” for use in a city almshouse. Though Swaim said the drug had cured a patient there, the Philadelphia Medical Society eventually concluded the opposite was true: The patient had died. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. observed in the 1840s that quacks, “in trumping up ‘Dispensaries,’ ‘Colleges of Health,’ and other advertising charitable clap-traps,” had used “the poor as decoy-ducks for the rich.” A façade of respectability allowed them to prey on the unsuspecting, however, and by 1906, Congress felt pressured to act. The Pure Food and Drug Act made it illegal to sell misbranded or adulterated food and drugs, and it helped establish the FDA, though quack medicines still appeared on market shelves. The skeptic researcher Joe Nickell wrote in 1998 that patent medicines like Dr. Worden’s Female Pills and Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills were sold by mail-order companies years after the act took effect, and he noted that the later rise of “alternative medicine” could threaten modern generations if left unchecked. Today’s quacks have learned to manipulate various regulatory loopholes to sell fake cures to the masses. Homeopathy is hardly more sophisticated than Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills, but consumers can still purchase bottles of such medicines at Whole Foods. Insurance companies will often cover chiropractic treatment, though the field was founded by a spiritualist who got the idea from a ghost. My brother and I used to giggle at “horny goat weed” in our local gas stations, but the side effects aren’t that funny; it can make the user puke or hallucinate. These days, you can buy it on Amazon. Wealthier consumers may prefer to shop from Goop, which sells a “gemstone heat-therapy map” for $1,049. A bro who tunes in to Joe Rogan may hear of wondrous nootropics like Alpha Brain, created by a Rogan friend; a 2024 lawsuit accused the maker of “deceptive” advertising. The FDA “can’t even require that supplements be effective before they are sold,” KFF Health News reported in February. Medical scams and nostrum-making are still popular — and profitable, too, even though they can be dangerous. In January, a Michigan child burned to death inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber where he had endured 36 futile treatments for ADHD and sleep apnea. Though the United States does not stand alone in its susceptibility to nostrums, its unfettered free market is a bonanza for hucksters. The FDA hasn’t approved the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for conditions like autism and ADHD, but clinics and med spas across the country advertise miraculous effects and remain largely unregulated, which frees them to maximize profits at the expense of consumers. Social media spreads dubious medical claims further than even Helmbold could dream. On Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, anyone can be a quack or work for one. So-called “alternative medicine” was a multibillion-dollar business in the U.S. before Trump ever took office. Now that he’s back in power, with Kennedy helming public health, we are poised for a new golden age of quackery. Trump is in some respects the quintessential president of the quack. He is a huckster in his own right, as former Trump University students may attest, and pseudoscience can prop up an authoritarian government. Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and the editor of Science-Based Medicine, has called the MAHA movement “the new Lysenkoism,” invoking a Soviet scientist who rose to prominence during Stalin’s regime. Trofim Lysenko repudiated Darwinism and the emerging field of genetics on ideological grounds, and his unfounded agricultural theories helped Stalin starve millions of people. We’re not there, but quackery still exacts a significant human toll. A nationwide measles outbreak has killed at least two children, but anti-vaccine parents and some doctors have attempted to treat the disease with cod-liver oil, though there’s no evidence that it works. Kennedy has nevertheless promoted the oil as a treatment for measles in his public statements. In May, Trump nominated Kennedy ally Casey Means to be surgeon general, though Means has questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and called researcher Dale Bredesen a “medical hero” — though Bredesen no longer practices medicine, he promotes a complicated diet and supplement regime that he claims can reverse symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Mostly, it’s expensive. People can pay $810 to join Apollo Health, Bredesen’s company, which matches them with a Bredesen-approved physician. The New York Times reported one Illinois couple spent $25,000 to treat Alzheimer’s the Bredesen way before concluding that the Bredesen protocol doesn’t work. Lawmakers thus face a difficult if urgent task, and so do the nation’s experts. Trump won’t be around forever, and he’s making sure pseudoscience will outlast him. The root of the problem isn’t necessarily public ignorance but exploitation. Right now, it’s a predator’s market, and that’s not a coincidence. Without robust public institutions and a health-care system that prioritizes care over profit, mistrust will fester. Americans will lead sicker and shorter lives, and the next pandemic may be even deadlier than COVID. Others will waste money on treatments that don’t work or sacrifice their children to scam artists. Fighting Trump means fighting MAHA and, with it, the quack and the huckster. Rebuilding the federal government and closing regulatory loopholes will cost nostrum-makers some cash, but it’s the only way to make America healthy at last.

Title: Amazon's Lab126 ventures into "Physical AI" with new robotics team
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/amazons-lab126-ventures-into-physical-ai-with-new-robotics-team/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T07:54:01Z
Full Content:
Amazon has announced that it’s forming a new agentic AI team within its secretive hardware research and development division, Lab126, to begin work on physical AI. Specifically, the company is looking to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics, which could start to impact blue-collar jobs, especially at its warehouses. Agentic AI is one of the latest developments in AI, superseding the previous generative AI that took off with the launch of ChatGPT. Agentic AI models are special because they can complete multi-step actions for the user to complete complex tasks. Thanks to all the visual and audio capabilities added to generative AI in previous years, these agentic models can perceive their environment, reason, plan, and act to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. If Amazon can successfully bring agentic AI to robots, they will finally be able to interact with the real world in a way they can’t today, as software running on a computer. Many people are concerned about AI’s impact on white-collar jobs right now, but when Amazon develops physical AI, it will also affect blue-collar manual work. The work is going to be carried out by Amazon’s R&D company, Lab126. It was set up over 20 years ago and has created many iconic Amazon devices, including the Kindle, Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Echo devices, and more. The biggest impact of physical AI developed by Lab126 will be on Amazon’s warehouses and logistics. The company said it wants to create robots that can perform tasks based on natural language instructions. As usual for a big tech company, Amazon claims that these robots will be assistants, but it’s difficult to see how they won’t reduce the need for people. Solely based on Amazon’s plans to automate work in its factories, customers will see an indirect impact from the move through faster deliveries and potentially lower costs. The decision by Amazon to focus on agentic AI in robots is pretty interesting because so far, we’ve mainly been hearing about agentic AI limited to computer applications, such as intelligent web browsers like Opera Neon. Amazon has a reputation for being an efficient company, particularly when it comes to the employment of warehouse workers who are known to have strict restroom breaks. Creating robots that can help speed up warehouse activities will further boost efficiency at the company and could potentially reduce its costs and improve safety. The beginning of work on physical AI is just the next evolution of AI that we could start to hear about in the coming months and years. As agentic AI gets better, companies will be looking to see what they can advance next and physical AI may be where they choose to go next; it certainly seems like this is what Amazon has settled on in this move. If Amazon’s physical AI doesn’t lead to mass layoffs of warehouse employees, it could drastically boost worker safety. Employees could potentially be less fatigued from moving around so much, which could lead to better concentration and fewer accidents. Right now, Amazon claims that these robots will only be assistants and not replacements. While Amazon will certainly be a leader in physical AI, given its massive wealth to throw at the problem, once the technology is available, it will likely be available for sale to other businesses to use, too. While it’s a notable development, it still sounds like Amazon is in the early stages of developing these physical AI systems, given that it has only just set up the team. We also don’t know what specific products Amazon is planning to build or the timelines for deployment. Ever since generative AI came onto the scene, there has been discussion of AI safety. With AI moving into the physical world, it will also bring up discussion about the safety concerns. Current measures are mainly concerned with AI software running on computers, not when it interacts physically with the world. Finally, and probably the biggest concern, what will these “assistants” do to people’s jobs? Companies will likely find themselves bringing in fewer new hires initially, but it could also displace people from their jobs. Source: CNBC

Title: AI Could Turn Democrats Into the New Welfare Class

The New York Times’s jeremiad last week about AI’s impact on entry-level jobs — particularly in tech — merely underscores trends that have been clear for well over a year. Silicon Valley firms have been slashing jobs despite record profits, and since 2022 California has actually shed positions in the information sector. An astonishing 82% of millennials fear AI will drive down their compensation. They have every reason to be concerned. This trend could create a political storm of massive proportions. In recent decades the Democratic Party has been able to compensate for its ebbing support among blue-collar workers by winning over college-trained professionals. Almost all college-educated professionals — excluding those in the military and airline pilots — lean overwhelmingly Democratic. College degrees, particularly graduate ones, are among the strongest indicators of a Leftist tilt, yet are becoming ever less salient in terms of garnering higher salaries. This base is under increased assault, as universities are forced to confront declining enrollments and ever less public approval. At the same time, the supply of entry-level graduate jobs at major firms such as Salesforce, Meta, Amazon and Lyft are dwindling due to the introduction of AI. Google, most notably, has recently laid off 12,000 workers — a number that is expected to grow to 30,000. The damage may be even greater at the grassroots level. Within months of AI’s emergence, freelance work in software declined markedly, along with pay. In a survey earlier this month, two-thirds of business leaders suggested that ChatGPT will lead to large layoffs of white-collar workers over the next five years. Already, new AI programmes are allowing software firms to do without lower-level programmers, particularly new hires. To be sure, Americans without college degrees are not immune to the effects of AI. But in the near term, it’s college professors, administrators, lawyers, accountants, and psychologists — largely Democratic-leaning professionals — who are increasingly in the crosshairs. Even Hollywood, a traditional Democratic stronghold, faces mounting threats: as entertainment becomes more digitised, layoffs have accelerated, and studios find it far easier to shift production to lower-cost regions such as Eastern Europe. Who wins here? It will be those professions that use AI to build things, such as drones, spaceships and robots. These firms are not as heavily concentrated in places like Silicon Valley, which has largely embraced software, social media and consumer services, leaving its once proud industrial heritage behind. This is a huge opportunity for Texas in particular, since the state has always been oriented towards tangible engineering. Texas may have missed the social media boom, but its industrial legacy has left it well placed to dominate the “deep tech” builder space. This field often requires reliable and affordable energy — something not easy to get in states such as California or New York. Beyond elite AI engineers, the other likely winners may be those in physical, hands-on jobs — mechanics or oil rig workers — that are much harder to automate. AI pioneer Rony Abovitz told me that the big winner in the coming years will be the “sophisticated, technically capable blue-collar worker”. Young people might be better off ignoring Joe Biden’s famous advice to “learn to code” and instead consider trade schools which teach practical, in-demand skills.

Title: Amazon files WARN notice for Reno fulfillment center closure

Amazon has filed notice with the state of Nevada for employee layoffs as the company moves forward with closing its Reno fulfillment center this summer. A WARN notice was sent by Amazon on Monday, June 2, and posted by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation on Wednesday morning. It confirmed that it will close its facility at 8000 N. Virginia St. on Aug. 2, 2025. WARN notices are 60-day notifications required by law when a company enacts massive layoffs. The notice is named after the 1989 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. WARN notices are required during: The Reno Gazette Journal first confirmed the planned closure of the Reno facility with Amazon in October. At the time, the facility employed about 500 people. Today, Amazon’s Reno fulfillment center has about 325 people working at the site, according to the company. Amazon has also provided transfers to more than 100 employees. “As we wind down operations at our Reno fulfillment center, we’re working closely with all affected employees to provide the latest information about transfer opportunities at other Amazon facilities in Reno and elsewhere,” an Amazon spokesperson told the Reno Gazette Journal. “For employees who choose not to remain with Amazon following this closure, we’re offering support through this transition.” Amazon also confirmed that it still plans to open a new same-day delivery facility in south Reno. Amazon filed a building permit in September for a new facility at the 580 South industrial center just across Mount Rose Highway from the Shayden Summit Reno mall. Employees affected by the closure of the Reno fulfillment will be given advance notice about job opportunities at the new same-day delivery center, according to Amazon. Construction of the new south Reno facility, however, has been pushed back from its initial late 2025 completion date. Work on Amazon’s new south Reno facility is expected to continue through 2026, Amazon confirmed. Amazon first opened its RNO4 fulfillment center in Reno in 2015. At the time, the 630,000-square-foot facility — which shipped its first package on Jan. 21 — was touted not just for its size but also technologies such as embedded wires that sync with forklifts and allow for the use of very narrow aisles plus a machine that can build on-demand custom-size boxes as needed. In just a decade, however, the Reno fulfillment center is now considered as an older facility and Amazon decided to not renew its lease. The company is also focusing more on increasing its number of smaller same-day delivery centers. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where we open new facilities, enhance existing facilities, and close others — including business need as well as how we can best improve the experience for employees, customers and partners,” said Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly at the time. “With our lease expiring at our facility in Reno, we’ve made the difficult decision to end operations out of that site next year.”

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world

By GRAHAM LEE BREWER NEW YORK (AP) — Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration’s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. “We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez’s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It’s now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country’s agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID’s adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden’s administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings “are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change.

In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It's now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country's agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID's adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden's administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings "are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” ___ This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Miguel Guimaraes Vásquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration’s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. “We think the situation is going to get worse.” Grist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez’s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one.

Here's How In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk, and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement released in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation.

Title: The FDA Launches Its Generative-AI Tool, Elsa, Ahead Of Schedule

Generative artificial intelligence has found another home in the federal government. On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the early launch of its very own generative AI that it hopes will improve efficiency. The FDA’s toolânicknamed Elsaâis designed to assist employees with everything from scientific reviews to basic operations. Originally, the FDA planned to launch by June 30, so Elsa is well ahead of schedule and under budget, according to an FDA statement. It’s not clear what exact information Elsa was trained on, but the FDA says that it didn’t use any “data submitted by regulated industry” in order to protect sensitive research and information. Currently, Elsa houses its information in GovCloud, an Amazon Web Services product specifically intended for classified information. As a language model, Elsa can help employees with reading, writing, and summarizing. In addition, the FDA said that it can summarize adverse events, generate code for nonclinical applications, and more. Per the agency, Elsa is already being used to “accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets.” In a May press release announcing the completion of the FDA’s first AI-assisted scientific review, Makary said he was “blown away” by Elsa’s capabilities, which “[hold] tremendous promise in accelerating the review time for new therapies”. He added, “We need to value our scientists’ time and reduce the amount of non-productive busywork that has historically consumed much of the review process.” According to one scientist, Jinzhong Liu, the FDA’s generative AI completed tasks in minutes that would otherwise take several days. In Tuesday’s announcement, FDA Chief AI Officer Jeremy Walsh said, “Today marks the dawn of the AI era at the FDA with the release of Elsa, AI is no longer a distant promise but a dynamic force enhancing and optimizing the performance and potential of every employee.” Generative AI can certainly be a useful tool, but every tool has its drawbacks. With AI specifically, there has been an uptick in stories about Â hallucinations which are outright false or misleading claims and statements. Although commonly associated with chatbots like ChatGPT, hallucinations can still pop up in federal AI models, where they can unleash even more chaos. Per IT Veterans, AI hallucinations typically stem from factors like biases in training data or a lack of fact-checking safeguards built into the model itself. Even with those in place, though, IT Veterans cautions that human oversight is “essential to mitigate the risks and ensure the reliability of AI-integrated federal data streams”. Ideally, the FDA has thoroughly considered and taken measures to prevent any mishaps with Elsa’s use. But the expansion of technology that really needs human oversight is always concerning when federal agencies are amidst mass layoffs. At the beginning of April, the FDA laid off 3,500 employees, including scientists and inspection staff (although some layoffs were later reversed). Time will reveal how Elsa ultimately performs. But eventually, the FDA plans to expand its use throughout the agency as it matures. This includes data processing and generative-AI functions to “further support the FDA’s mission.” Artificial intelligenceFDA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: More or less
URL: https://longform.asmartbear.com/more-or-less/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T11:16:48Z
Full Content:
There are three viable strategies in the interplay between value and price: You see this pattern across all industries, in both consumer and business markets. More for more Cardigan by Miu Miu for â¬2,150 In clothing, for example, a cashmere sweater embodies More for moreâexpensive, but deliciously soft (enjoyment) and warm (functional). A high-end brand has a function beyond high-quality materials: Status is bestowed upon the owner, due to it being overpriced beyond its quality. Buyers are not budget-constrained, which enables high prices and correspondingly high profit margins, but customers also have their pick of options, where every other product on the planet is a competitor. The customer is in control. Hence the importance of being âthe bestâ according to some subset of the market. More for less Sweater by L.L. Bean for â¬92 More for less describes the practical decision-making that governs most purchases: Highly functional articles that will last for years, at one-fifth or even one-tenth the price of the same luxury item. Most people have a budget and therefore are seeking âThe best that I can afford.â Thus price is the primary constraint, inside which they prioritize features according to personal preference; they canât have everything, but they can prioritize everything. The productâs goal is not to be the best along every dimension, but rather to offer a set of trade-offs that enough customers prefer over other sets. Less for Less Hoodie by Tamu for â¬7 Fast-fashion vendors provide Less for less, where youâll find the article disintegrated in the washing machine by the end of the season, but hey, it was cheaper than lunch. Consumers arenât choosing between trade-offs, but rather between having a sweater, or having no sweater at all. All negatives are accepted, as there is no alternative. The vendor enjoys a massive market, but rock-bottom prices mandate extreme cost-efficiency, requiring almost non-existent marketing and sales costs, and even in the best case yields barely any profit even at scale. A competitor with a better cost structure can decimate the business. Donât worry about it. All three approaches are valid and, like all strategies, each drags along a set of consequences, some of which you despise, others you love. You must pick one approach, and accept its batch of consequences. If you donât incorporate those consequences into the rest of your strategy, youâll have a confusing market message, a Frankenstein product, and the wrong pricing model. Building âthe bestâ is wonderful for both profit and enjoyment of life. It feels good to have pride in your craft, to have customers who love what you do and agree with your superlative self-assessment. âThe bestâ commands a high price, which makes profit easier, even while self-funding further investment. This is a beautiful place to be, but it comes with consequences. âThe bestâ is not the average of a subset of things that already exist. The best is an outlier. The best is special. The best is different. Your ideas need to be substantially different from whatâs already available, or itâs definitionally not true that youâre the best. So, the first question is: The best at what? It could be anything, but it has to be specific, and customers have to agree itâs worth the higher price tag. It could be the best designâthe simplest, the most pleasant to use, the most beautiful. It could be qualityâthe peace of mind and enjoyment of a product always âjust worksâ. It could be a superior workflow, could be that it integrates with all the tools the customer uses, it could be personal tech support, and more. This article on âWillingness to payâ lists more ways of being âthe bestâ. Coupled with âbest at whatâ is âbest for whom?â There are billions of people on the planet who absolutely do not agree what âbestâ means in clothes, software, food, or articles about pricing strategy. This is where founders get fouled up; they think that just because they love it, and they âbuilt it for myselfâ and therefore âI am the customer,â and therefore other people will also to pay to solve that problem, in that way. They rarely do. The fallacies with that assumption (and some truths), are detailed here. Instead, use your initial spark of insight as the starting point, your motivation, knowing that half of it is indeed correct but half isnât, and so you go find potential customers to interview, and use a structured process to fix your hypotheses to morph your definition of âbestâ into alignment with what some specific ideal customer. Customers in this category care about something even more than they care about price. What kinds of things are like that? In business, an example is so-called âmission-criticalâ things, i.e. a failure or low quality causes outsized damage in internal cost, or far worse, damage to their reputation, in the worst case causing customers to leave.1 Something that is an urgent, top priority for them right now, whether due to emergency or strategic mandate.2 In the consumer world, it could be what Google calls a âtoothbrush productââsomething vital that is used at least twice a day, or ideally all day,3 or tied to personal identity.4 1 Our company WP Engine is an example, because we run websites like eCommerce (all of the customersâ revenue) or media (merely being slow means they lose traffic, which means they lose ad revenue) or corporate home pages (downtime costs lost leads and lower reputation). This can also be CYA, i.e. âno one ever got fired for buying ______â. 2 See this article for many examples of how this arises, and how to define your target customer and product to match. 3 Examples: to-do apps for busy people, email for people who spend more than an hour per day there, calendar apps for people whose calendars look like they only barely lost a game of Tetris, note-taking apps for people with 1000s of notes 4 Like luxury brands, where being âfar too expensiveâ is the point, like a ram with ridiculous horns. Being âthe bestâ isnât just about the product or the customer-fit; all other decisions must also be aligned with that positioning. Your marketing will focus on excellence and exclusivity rather than affordability. Your team will likely be smaller with higher-caliber individualsâpassionate artisans who take pride in creating excellence and celebrate perfectionism. When hiring, youâll focus on finding the top 1% of talent, often paying premium salaries. Your customer support isnât measured in hours but minutes, often with white-glove, personalized service and dedicated account representatives. Your product development cycles may be slower, emphasizing perfection before launch, developing features without cutting corners regardless of cost. Because the number of customers in the market is small and limited, market-share matters, and upgrading existing customers is vital for growth at scale.5 5 Many public enterprise software companies get the majority of their revenue growth from up-selling existing customers, rather than adding new ones. Fortunately, the high price tag means you can invest in these things. And if you pull it off, itâs the best for yourself because youâre fulfilled when youâre exercising your best qualities and youâre validated when others agree on Twitter and say it to your face. You can recruit great employees, because who doesnât want to work at a company whose customers actually love them? Most products are not âthe bestâ. But for those who can deliver it, it creates a virtuous cycle of excellence, satisfaction, and profitability thatâs hard to beat. Efficiency is beautiful. âMore for lessâ means receiving outsized value for a given cost. It is the right value proposition for most things in life, especially in business where you need to get a job done as cheaply as possible, but not cheaper. The global apparel industry exemplifies the claim that this is the most popular category. The âmore for lessâ category generates $1,200B of the industryâs total $1,600B annual revenue, with luxury at $250B and fast-fashion at $150B. With profit margins of 5%-15%,6 they are unsurprisingly more profitable than fast-fashion (under 5%)7 and less than luxury (20%-30%).8 âMore for lessâ software companies can have much better profit margins than apparel; coupled with reasonable prices and addressing the largest market segment, this is a great business model. 6 L.L. Bean, makers of the sweater above, is private and doesnât report profit, so this range is based on their 10% annual spend on bonuses and give-back activity and data from other retailers. 7 The outlier-most-profitable fast-fashion brand stands at 9%, but almost all are under 5%. 8 For example Prada, which makes the Miu Miu sweater above, generates 23% net profit. Which types of product benefit from high-efficiency, but doesnât require âthe best?â Perhaps almost anything. Back-end systems that operate the company but are invisible to customer are a good start, because no competitive advantage is conveyed to the company for getting âthe best.â Even more ideally, areas where downtime isnât terribly disruptive to their real-time operations; a reporting system can be down for an hour without hurting their business, but a customer support tool cannot. Or an area where itâs OK if not every desired feature is present, again like reporting software where the lack of exactly the right chart-type is not a deal-breaker, and wonât prevent them from seeing the data. Even better when the product just needs to âtick a boxâ to âsay that we have it,â because then requirements wonât be stringent. It might sound negative that your product isnât âcritical to their successâ, but being non-real-time, non-essential, also means you have far more leniency in quality or lack of features. This leniency in requirements is also why you will make 100x more sales than you expect, even though you still target the âperfectâ ideal customer with marketing and product features. For your ideal customer, you are in fact âthe best,â and they cannot believe theyâre getting the âMore for moreâ product for the âMore for lessâ price. That attitude defines them as the ideal customer; if you canât win them over from your home page, youâre not doing your job. But, for every one of those, thereâs a hundred others where youâre the right choice. You have most of what they want, you donât have any deal-breakers, and the price is right, so youâve made the sale. So, you gain the power of specificity, clarity, and emotional connection from talking to your ideal customer, while winning all the âMore for lessâ customers anyway. This article on ICPs explains this dynamic in detail, with examples. Although the main value here is economy, âsave moneyâ is weak positioning. Position by showing how much value youâre generating rather than how much money youâre saving as described in this article on positioning for value. Because, even if this is your pricing strategy, that doesnât mean itâs your marketing material. Your marketing position still needs to be as strong as possible, emphasizing that it really is more for less. As with the other pricing strategies, the rest of your decisions must be aligned. Marketing will make the customer feel like this is the âsmart choice,â neither wasting money on useless branding nor falling prey to the mistake of âIf you think this is expensive, wait until you see how expensive âcheapâ is.â Marketing must make the trade-offs clear, not try to claim itâs the best for everyone, which quietly alienates everyone; comparison charts shouldnât be a solid column of green checkmarks, but rather elucidate where you are strong, and where you are not the right solution. Product features must not be too difficult to maintain, as the price tag doesnât allow for special exceptions or for brittle integrations that only 5% of the customers use. Rather, build only those features used by at least 50% of customers, or where at least 15% of customers buy you specifically for that reason. Hire team members who excel at identifying and eliminating waste without sacrificing core value. Your whole business must reflect the âMore for lessâ mentality; your internal costs and decisions match your external promises. Pundits have long eschewed the âMore for lessâ strategy as a poor compromise between being either âthe bestâ or âthe cheapest.â As Michael Porter famously wrote in Competitive Strategy (1980), there are only three strategies: (a) Differentiated Best; (b) Low-Cost Leader; (c) Niche Leader. Later thinkers pointed out that (a) and (c) are the same, differing only in market-scope. This leaves the Porter model with what I am calling âMore for moreâ and âLess for less.â However, the customers have spoken, and in most consumer and business industries, it is in fact the âMore for lessâ category that wins most of the customers and most of the revenue and most of the profits. We must not fall prey to the incorrect attitude that this is âa balanceâ between value and cost; we should instead recognize that âMore for lessâ is a third, independent strategy, and leverage its strengths to the fullest. They say ânever compete on priceâ, but as the linked article demonstrates, that statement is incorrect. There are many wildly successful companies, from solo bootstrappers to some of the largest and most-profitable companies in the world,9 who became successful due to absolute rock-bottom prices, even though those products come with severe trade-offs that many consumers would not accept. Sometimes, âcheapestâ is âbestâ. It may seem like âless for lessâ couldnât be a good strategy, because neither employees nor consumers ought to be happy with âless,â and low prices means low revenue, which in turns means little money for marketing, sales, development, support, product, design, or fun company-culture stuff around the office.10 All that is true, and are among the consequences we accept when we adopt this strategy, but the hundreds of billions of dollars of profit (to say nothing of revenue) generated by the many âless for lessâ successes prove that these trade-offs are sometimes the right ones. 9 Examples: Amazon, Walmart, Vanguard, Costco, Dollar General, IKEA, Southwest Airlines, H&M, Zara, Xiaomi, ALDI 10 Or whatever virtual-office-substitute weâre pretending has the same effect as human beings being beings together. When something is surprisingly cheap, customers are not surprised that they have to compromise on most dimensions, such as quality, design, convenience, features, service, appearance, or longevity. Sure, itâs missing some obvious features. Sure, it doesnât integrate with Enterprise systems. Sure, customer service is going to be a set of knowledge-based articles. Sure, it sometimes crashes. What did you expect for $5 per month? There are billions of people who will buy $5 clothes that barely survive the season. If I pay $2/month for web hosting and I get email and a website, itâs okay if the email gets some spam and the website is not always fast or even always working. And I donât expect the clothing retailer to have customer service or accept returns, and I donât expect tech support from that web host to know anything beyond helping me reset my password. The fundamental reason a customer will accept a wide range of trade-offs is that the alternative is to not have the product at all. That is, the choice is between having any hoodie versus having no hoodie. The product is âbinaryâ in this senseâhaving versus not-havingâthanks to an accessible price tag. One does not quibble over âfeaturesâ or âqualityâ or âserviceâ when the alternative is ânothingâ. This is at once empoweringâsupplying goods to people who otherwise had no accessâand depressingâthat so many people cannot afford the comforts invented through modern ingenuity. And so we generate the worst versions of those items for most of the world to âenjoy.â Which viewpoint is correct? The answer can often be found in the mission and purpose behind the companyâthe real one, not the one written by the marketing department on the âAbout Usâ pageâwhere the fundamental driver of the company is either one of empowerment and impact, or one that exploits desperation. Regardless, the company should extol the positive aspects in branding and positioning: Emphasizing democratization, participation, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. The hardest part of executing this strategy is being profitable, since thereâs so little revenue to be profitable with. The costs have to be extraordinarily, unconventionally low. Some of that can come with scale, either directly (e.g. bulk-purchases from suppliers) or structurally (e.g. tech support per customer is lower at 100,000 customers than at 100, simply because most of them donât have a question in any given month). Still, it takes a lot of $2/mo customers before you can afford to hire even a single tech support person. Or if winning a customer means winning $2/mo and maybe $50 across the entire lifetime of that customer, you canât afford to pay very much to acquire that customer, whether thatâs in direct advertising spend, or sharing revenue with an influencer,11 or indirect so-called âorganicâ marketing,12 and you certainly canât have a sales team. You must rely on word-of-mouth and reviews from customers; youâll need to encourage it. 11 Affiliates are paid only after you are paid, which means this is an affordable form of marketing from the start. 12 While harder to get customers at first, when pages arenât ranked in Google and social media accounts arenât followed by anyone, those assets do scale over time. Given that revenue will significantly lag costs, is it mandatory that such a company raise money? The company will certainly consume cash for a while, whether thatâs in the form of someoneâs savings, friends-and-family, a loan, or indeed raising money. Annual billing can help quite a bit. This is why pundits (including me) are always telling bootstrappers to âraise their pricesâ or, since you now know that prices are coupled with every other strategic decision in the company: âswitch from a âless for lessâ strategy to either âmore for lessâ or âmore for more.ââ If you donât want to raise money, donât build a business that burns money on purpose. However, itâs not true that such business need to raise an exorbitant amount of money. In fact, in the same article above, every one of the four case studies (which each grew to multiple-billion dollars in revenue) raised only a small amount of money. Those stories are detailed in the article. When the strategic decisions are fully aligned to a low-cost operation, you only need enough starter cash to get going. This is where VC-funded companies often get it wrong; they assume âwe can work the costs out later,â but when âlaterâ comes, they realize their processes, technology, and culture has solidified around whatever worked for acquiring customers, and change is either impossible or dramatically painful, like layoffs, rewriting the code that works, and trying to force unnatural marketing and sales motions. There are also examples of bootstrapped companies using this strategy who never raised money; they typically have some extreme cost advantage, such as being located in a country with extremely low costs, yet selling to the United States and Europe. Being physically located in a low-cost zone is a competitive advantage that companies in The West cannot match. As usual, what doesnât work is having a low price without the rest of the strategic decisions. This constantly happens with inexperienced founders who think: âMy product sucks, so Iâm not comfortable charging a lot.â Thatâs not a good reason, and you shouldnât just build crappy product. Instead, the question should be: How do I build a simple yet lovable product that some specific ideal customer would pay 10x more than Iâm currently charging, even though it doesnât have a lot of features, and sometimes doesnât even work? Thatâs exactly what I did with WP Engine. While the hardest intrinsic challenge is to be profitable, the hardest external challenge is that a competitor can beat you with lower prices alone. And this is all too easy, because thereâs so many reasons why a competitor might win: The antidote is to constantly increase your cost-efficiency, and possibly proactively lower prices. This is what Amazon did in retail and later did in the cloud.14 13 A particularly ironic example: Microsoft killed Netscape by putting over a thousand developers on Internet Explorer and releasing it for free; more than a decade later, Google killed Explorer by putting over a thousand developers on Chrome and releasing it for free. 14 Amazon knew from their âyour margin is my opportunityâ strategy in retail, they should proactively reduce prices as their cloud operations scaled, to prevent people from looking for alternatives. Later, when Microsoft and Google were established as the only two serious competitors, they all stopped lowering prices simultaneously. Surely a coincidence? âLess for lessâ is brutal, because of relentless competition and having no extra money to work with. But, it means accessing the largest number of potential customers, and in the best case, you are truly enriching the world by bringing goods and services to people who otherwise could not afford to enjoy them. All three pricing strategies are validâeach boasts wildly successful companies of all sizes, in every country. Ideally, one of these strategies jumps out at you as the smartest one, or at least the one youâd be the most excited and proud to implement. Another might jump out as being dumb, or at least too difficult, not worth the consequences, not where you want to spend your precious, irreplaceable time on this Earth. Listen to your gut. Because all are, in fact, smart strategies, you should pick the one that best matches your personal strengths and proclivities, because thatâs the one you will execute the best while being most fulfilled. This is another choice that increases your chance of success. The only wrong choice is to not choose at all, and thus be confusing to customers and misaligned with the rest of your strategy. Then you will make internally-inconsistent choices, working against yourself, and your customers wonât know how to think about your product, which means they wonât be comfortable buying it. And then your product is the right choice for no one. â

Title: The hidden time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs
URL: https://qz.com/tech-layoffs-tax-code-trump-section-174-microsoft-meta-1851783502

For the past two years, it’s been a ghost in the machine of American tech. Between 2022 and today, a little-noticed tweak to the U.S. tax code has quietly rewired the financial logic of how American companies invest in research and development. Outside of CFO and accounting circles, almost no one knew it existed. “I work on these tax write-offs and still hadn’t heard about this,” a chief operating officer at a private-equity-backed tech company told Quartz. “It’s just been so weirdly silent.” Still, the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what’s known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies. Now, as a bipartisan effort to repeal the Section 174 change moves through Congress, bigger questions are surfacing: How did a single line in the tax code help trigger a tsunami of mass layoffs? And why did no one see it coming? For almost 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development spending in the year they incurred the costs. Salaries, software, contractor payments — if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it came off the top of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was guaranteed by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. Microsoft was founded in 1975. Apple (AAPL) launched its first computer in 1976. Google (GOOGL) incorporated in 1998. Facebook opened to the general public in 2006. All these companies, now among the most valuable in the world, developed their earliest products — programming tools, hardware, search engines — under a tax system that rewarded building now, not later. The subsequent rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and mobile apps also happened in an America where companies could immediately write off their investments in engineering, infrastructure, and experimentation. It was a baseline assumption — innovation and risk-taking subsidized by the tax code — that shaped how founders operated and how investors made decisions. In turn, tech companies largely built their products in the U.S. Microsoft’s operating systems were coded in Washington state. Apple’s early hardware and software teams were in California. Google’s search engine was born at Stanford and scaled from Mountain View. Facebook’s entire social architecture was developed in Menlo Park. The deduction directly incentivized keeping R&D close to home, rewarding companies for investing in American workers, engineers, and infrastructure. That’s what makes the politics of Section 174 so revealing. For all the rhetoric about bringing jobs back and making things in America, the first Trump administration’s major tax bill arguably helped accomplish the opposite. When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% — a massive revenue loss on paper for the federal government. To make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers needed to offset the cost. So they added future tax hikes that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174 — from immediate expensing of R&D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods — was that kind of provision. It didn’t start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring. The delay wasn’t a technical necessity. It was a political tactic. Such moves are common in tax legislation. Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits — scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows. And so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&D wasn’t a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. To understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared. It’s no coincidence that Meta announced its “Year of Efficiency” immediately after the Section 174 change took effect. Ditto Microsoft laying off 10,000 employees in January 2023 despite strong earnings, or Google parent Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs around the same time. Amazon (AMZN) also laid off almost 30,000 people, with cuts focused not just on logistics but on Alexa and internal cloud tools — precisely the kinds of projects that would have once qualified as immediately deductible R&D. Salesforce (CRM) eliminated 10% of its staff, or 8,000 people, including entire product teams. In public, companies blamed bloat and AI. But inside boardrooms, spreadsheets were telling a quieter story. And MD&A notes — management’s notes on the numbers — buried deep in 10-K filings recorded the change, too. R&D had become more expensive to carry. Headcount, the leading R&D expense across the tech industry, was the easiest thing to cut. In its 2023 annual report, Meta described salaries as its single biggest R&D expense. Between the first and second years that the Section 174 change began affecting tax returns, Meta cut its total workforce by almost 25%. Over the same period, Microsoft reduced its global headcount by about 7%, with cuts concentrated in product-facing, engineering-heavy roles. Smaller companies without the fortress-like balance sheets of Big Tech have arguably been hit even harder. Twilio (TWLO) slashed 22% of its workforce in 2023 alone. Shopify (SHOP) (headquartered in Canada but with much of its R&D teams in the U.S.) cut almost 30% of staff in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase (COIN) reduced headcount by 36% across a pair of brutal restructuring waves. Since going into effect, the provision has hit at the very heart of America’s economic growth engine: the tech sector. By market cap, tech giants dominate the S&P 500, with the “Magnificent 7” alone accounting for more than a third of the index’s total value. Workforce numbers tell a similar story, with tech employing millions of Americans directly and supporting the employment of tens of millions more. As measured by GDP, capital-T tech contributes about 10% of national output. It’s not just that tech layoffs were large, it’s that they were massively disproportionate. Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a whopping 60% jump in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies — a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms — basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads — built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. But the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector. This lines up with OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies ran with that logic. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Add that to core tech’s contribution, and the Section 174 shift has likely touched at least 20% of the U.S. economy. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue effectively hid a time bomb inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. And when it detonated, it kneecapped the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America look irrational on a spreadsheet. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to repeal the Section 174 change, with business groups, CFOs, crypto executives, and venture capitalists lobbying hard for retroactive relief. But the politics are messy. Fixing 174 would mean handing a tax break to the same companies many voters in both parties see as symbols of corporate excess. Any repeal would also come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off. And of course, the losses don’t stop at Meta’s or Google’s campus gates. They ripple out. When high-paid tech workers disappear, so do the lunch orders. The house tours. The contract gigs. The spending habits that sustain entire urban economies and thousands of other jobs. Sandwich artists. Rideshare drivers. Realtors. Personal trainers. House cleaners. In tech-heavy cities, the fallout runs deep — and it’s still unfolding. Washington is now poised to pass a second Trump tax bill — one packed with more obscure provisions, more delayed impacts, more quiet redistribution. And it comes as analysts are only just beginning to understand the real-world effects of the last round. The Section 174 change “significantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States’ competitiveness on the global stage,” according to the tax consulting firm KBKG. Whether the U.S. will reverse course — or simply adapt to a new normal — remains to be seen. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: IT Unionization

Steve Jones, 2025-06-04 I've been reading an interesting book that looks at some of the ways that we can better build software in enterprises. One of the side notes in the book is that the tech companies have the funding and the ability to disrupt many other types of businesses, not just technology. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have delved into other types of industries, potentially pushing others out. We see Amazon becoming as much a shipping and logistics company as they are a retailer. There was a unionization vote, which passed in 2022. Recently, another one failed. Amazon continues to fight these efforts, trying to prevent workers from collectively negotiating the terms of their employment. I've wondered in the past if tech workers would ever unionize. In general, we are paid well and have lots of options for work. There has often been no shortage of opportunities for talented workers, though this year is proving tough for our industry. There are lots of people out of work and struggling to find new jobs. While I'm sure some would prefer a union that might better protect them from layoffs, many tech workers are against the idea. There is a growing number of tech workers looking to unionize. Inside Google, there is a union for some workers, but not all. That's unusual, as often all workers in a category are part of a union at a company. To gain employment, you need to join the union. I don't know if I'd want to join a union. I've had lots of success and haven't seen the need, but I do know that I've also seen lots of other tech workers pressured and pushed to work long hours, to skip vacations, and other practices that are good for the employer, but not so good for the employee. I've seen many people not know how to negotiate with employers, and perhaps a union would benefit most people. Would you want to be part of a data professionals' union? It might give some security and more benefits for many, though not quite as much pay as you might otherwise receive. Maybe more than you get now, as it depends on where you sit in the salary scale at your company. Let me know what you think about unions today.

Title: Builder.ai collapses after revelation that its 'AI' was hundreds of engineers

Cutting corners: Builder.ai promised to revolutionize software development with artificial intelligence – and convinced deep-pocketed investors it had. Backed by Microsoft and valued at $1.5 billion, the startup masked manual labor as machine learning until the facade crumbled, leaving behind lawsuits, layoffs, and one of the industry's most embarrassing collapses. Builder.ai has collapsed under the weight of several deceptions, ending the rise of a British startup once heralded as a pioneer in democratizing software development. Valued at $1.5 billion in 2023 with backing from Microsoft and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the company filed for bankruptcy protection this week after revelations that its "AI-powered" platform relied on hundreds of engineers in India while executives allegedly orchestrated a years-long financial deception. For eight years, Builder.ai marketed its "Natasha" AI system as a fully autonomous tool that could build software "as easily as ordering pizza." However, internal documents and employee accounts reviewed by Bloomberg paint a sharply different picture. Engineers in Noida and Bangalore manually coded client projects while being instructed to mimic AI-generated responses. "We were told to never mention our location or use Indian English phrases," said a former Bangalore engineer. The team timed updates to UK business hours to maintain the illusion of automation. The company's downfall accelerated in April 2025 when Bloomberg exposed a round-tripping scheme with Indian social media firm VerSe Innovation. From 2021 to 2024, the two companies exchanged nearly identical invoices totaling millions of dollars for services never rendered, artificially inflating Builder.ai's revenue by up to 300 percent. Audits later revealed 2024 revenues totaled just $55 million – a fraction of the $220 million projected to investors. VerSe co-founder Umang Bedi denied the allegations, calling them "absolutely baseless." Microsoft's $455 million investment in 2023, including plans to integrate Builder.ai's technology with Azure, now stands as a cautionary tale. The partnership fell apart when creditor Viola Credit seized $37 million from Builder.ai's accounts after uncovering inflated financials, leaving only $5 million in restricted funds. The startup also owes $85 million to Amazon and $30 million to Microsoft for cloud services. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has subpoenaed financial records and customer lists as part of a widening probe into potential securities fraud. Separately, the SEC is investigating whether Builder.ai misrepresented its technological capabilities to investors. Internal Slack messages show executives directing staff to "minimize visibility" of human labor in investor materials. "Positioning must focus on our proprietary AI – human labor isn't part of the story," a 2022 internal memo stated. Founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who styled himself Chief Wizard, resigned as CEO in February 2025 amid mounting losses and relocated to Dubai. His replacement, Manpreet Ratia, disclosed that the company laid off approximately 80 percent of its global workforce – about 1,000 employees. The insolvency marks the most significant AI startup failure to occur since ChatGPT's breakthrough debut in 2022, underscoring growing scrutiny of "AI washing" across the tech sector.

Title: What’s Going On With The Part Of The Disney Co. Folks Forget About, Disney Publishing
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/97865-what-comes-next-for-a-changed-disney-publishing.html
Time Published: 2025-06-03T14:01:00Z
Full Content:
The Walt Disney Company’s book operations have undergone a series of changes over the years as the company has morphed into a media and entertainment colossus. Disney Publishing’s most recent big pivot came in 2020, when it sold 1,110 children’s titles to Hachette Book Group and made the decision to focus on acquiring global content that it can leverage across multiple platforms and media. In recent months, the group has made a number of significant changes, but company executives said their mission remains the same. “We remain focused on acquiring and developing global content that could be leveraged across multiple platforms and media,” Tonya Agurto, SVP and publisher of new IP and global business development, Disney Publishing, wrote in an email to PW. While its objectives remains unchanged, Disney has made a number of tweaks to its publishing division in order to fulfill that mission. Over the last six months, two high-ranking children’s publishing executives have left the company, which also made a number of layoffs in marketing and other departments earlier this year. In April, it announced several promotions at Hyperion Avenue, the adult imprint Disney founded in 2021, eight years after it sold the majority of its adult titles to HBG. Earlier this month, Disney announced it had reached a new, broad licensing agreement with Penguin Random House, a move that had been rumored for weeks. Under the agreement, PRH is licensing content from the 20th Century Studios, Disney, Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, and Star Wars units. The agreement includes children’s books; middle grade, young adult, and adult novels; manga; and reference books across print, e-book, and audio formats. PRH has licensed Disney properties for over 20 years, and both parties called the deal an expansion of their relationship. The agreement also deepens Disney’s ties to PRH, which took over distribution for Disney’s adult and children’s print books from HBG in 2023. In her email, Agurto noted that Disney Publishing has a presence in more than 100 countries and products available in more than 40 languages, adding that “as our business evolves, we continue to explore new licensing agreements that bring books to fans of all ages.” After finalizing the agreement, Random House Children’s Books hired about a dozen editors and other employees who had worked at Disney Publishing on the National Geographic Kids imprint. Among the new PRH employees is Vivian Suchman, who was named editorial director of National Geographic Kids after serving as managing editor for that imprint while it was at Disney. The announcement of the PRH licensing agreement came a few weeks after Monique Diman-Riley was promoted from director of sales in North America for Disney Publishing Group to VP of sales and retail strategy for Disney Publishing. In that role, Disney said, Diman-Riley will “expand her scope to work with licensing partners to drive promotional branded opportunities at retail for the larger Disney publishing portfolio.” Among the executives who have recently departed Disney are Kieran Viola and Sylvie Frank. Viola joined Disney in 2021 to oversee Disney Hyperion, with a mandate to find new bestselling children’s authors, and is now an executive editor at Scholastic. Frank had served as editorial director of Disney Hyperion, overseeing acquisitions across all young reader formats, as well as the Freedom Fire and Disney Planet Possible imprints; she is now senior executive editor at Flamingo Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers. Following the moves, Jennifer Levesque now heads up all children’s and adult imprints at Disney. This spring, Levesque was promoted from director of editorial for Hyperion Avenue to deputy publisher for Disney Publishing Group, where she also oversees both Hyperion Kids and National Geographic Adult. A Whole New World In email responses to PW, Agurto repeatedly referred to Disney as the number one children’s publishing brand. Still, as far as original trade publishing goes, the company appears to be slipping. Disney doesn’t disclose financial information on publishing, but a look at PW bestseller lists indicates that the company has had a diminishing presence on the children’s side. In 2023, Disney had 14 titles reach PW’s children’s frontlist fiction list, keeping the company on the charts for 68 weeks; last year, that number fell to seven titles across 57 weeks last year. In 2019, Disney stayed on the same list for 81 weeks, with 19 books. Disney's most reliably bestselling author to date is Rick Riordan, through his Percy Jackson series and Rick Riordan Presents imprint. Riordan's two frontlist Jackson titles in 2024 sold approximately 450,000 print copies combined, according to Circana BookScan. But backlist sales across the company have softened in recent years—no doubt due in part to the 1,100 children’s titles it sold to HBG in 2020. The future of several Disney children’s imprints also appears uncertain. In October 2023, the company announced the launch of Kugali Ink, a collaboration with pan-African entertainment company Kugali designed to celebrate African voices. Its first two graphic novels, Akanni and Runeless, are due out this year, but neither title has yet been listed on Amazon, and PW has not received galleys for review. In a previous release announcing a number of promotions, Disney said that Rachel Stark had been promoted to senior editor at Hyperion, and that they would serve as lead editor for Kugali Ink. In Stark’s own note in the announcement, they stressed that they acquire and edit middle grade and young adult novels and graphic novels, quipping that this wasn’t a new role and observing that “agents often seem to believe I only acquire graphic novels.” A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on Kugali, adding that the company had no additional information to share about the status of its Melissa de la Cruz Studio and Freedom Fire imprints. On the adult side, however, things seem a bit more stable. With Levesque’s promotion, Adam Wilson, previously executive editor for Hyperion Avenue, was named editorial director, and now oversees the acquisition of adult fiction and nonfiction as well as the creation of original adult IP. Among his focuses, per Disney’s promotion announcement, are the oversight of nonfiction projects by individuals with a connection to other Disney projects and collaborations with a number of other Disney-owned groups—including ABC, ESPN, FX, Hulu, and Marvel—on both fiction and nonfiction book initiatives. In her email to PW, Agurto doubled down on Disney’s commitment to adult nonfiction publishing. “We continue to support nonfiction through both our vertical and licensees,” she wrote, pointing to the nonfiction published under Andscape, Hyperion, and National Geographic Adult. Forthcoming titles from those imprints include memoirs from actor and sports broadcaster Jayne Kennedy and the late film producer Jon Landau (Avatar; Titanic). Since its 2021 launch, Hyperion Avenue has also added the Marvel Crime line, which publishes books by bestselling crime and mystery authors featuring Marvel’s characters; the imprint’s first title, Breaking the Dark: A Jessica Jones Marvel Crime Novel, hit shelves last year. Overall, Hyperion Avenue saw two titles—A Confident Cook and Tangled Up in You—hit the PW adult bestseller lists in 2024, each staying for one week. For years, especially when synergy was the business-world strategy of the moment, top executives at Disney took different approaches on how to best fit book publishing into the corporation. But Disney is now a $91 billion conglomerate, with interests that range from cruise ships to streaming services to ESPN to theme parks. Given the scope of its businesses and the scale of recent changes, many industry insiders have been left wondering what, exactly, the current plan for books is inside the Magic Kingdom. Loading...

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Corrects paragraph 14 to remove reference to Google and Amazon declining to comment. This line also appeared in an earlier version of this story.) By Anna Tong and Krystal Hu SAN FRANCISCO :Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, return on investment in generative AI has been elusive, but one area stands out: software development. So-called code generation or “code-gen” startups are commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading Cursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco that can suggest and complete lines of code and write whole sections of code autonomously, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May from a who’s who list of tech investors, including Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel. Windsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is now in talks to acquire the company for $3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its tool is known for translating plain English commands into code, sometimes called “vibe coding,” which allows people with no knowledge of computer languages to write software. OpenAI and Windsurf declined to comment on the acquisition.“AI has automated all the repetitive, tedious work,” said Scott Wu, CEO of code gen startup Cognition. “The software engineer’s role has already changed dramatically. It’s not about memorizing esoteric syntax anymore.”Founders of code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard. But because most are built on AI foundation models developed elsewhere, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek, their costs per query are also growing, and none are yet profitable. They’re also at risk of being disrupted by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which all announced new code-gen products in May, and Anthropic is also working on one as well, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf. Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021 and considered code-gen’s dominant player, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter. Microsoft declined to comment on GitHub Copilot’s revenue. On Microsoft’s earnings call in April, the company said the product has over 15 million users.LEARN TO CODE?As AI revolutionizes the industry, many jobs - particularly entry-level coding positions that are more basic and involve repetition - may be eliminated. Signalfire, a VC firm that tracks tech hiring, found that new hires with less than a year of experience fell 24 per cent in 2024, a drop it attributes to tasks once assigned to entry-level software engineers are now being fulfilled in part with AI.Google’s CEO also said in April that “well over 30 per cent” of Google’s code is now AI-generated, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year the company had saved “the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years” by using AI.In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a conference that approximately 20 to 30 per cent of their code is now AI-generated. The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally, with over 40 per cent of those being software developers in Microsoft’s home state, Washington.“We’re focused on creating AI that empowers developers to be more productive, creative, and save time,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “This means some roles will change with the revolution of AI, but human intelligence remains at the center of the software development life cycle.”MOUNTING LOSSESSome “vibe-coding” platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues.Cursor, with just 60 employees, went from zero to $100 million in recurring revenue by January 2025, less than two years since its launch. Windsurf, founded in 2021, launched its code generation product in November 2024 and is already bringing in $50 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the company. But both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make, according to four investor sources familiar with their operations. “The prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,” Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, told Reuters. Both Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties, and exemplify the gold rush era of the AI startup scene. “I haven’t seen people working this hard since the first Internet boom,” said Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. What’s less clear is whether the dozen or so code-gen companies will be able to hang on to their customers as big tech moves in. “In many cases, it's less about who's got the best technology - it’s about who is going to make the best use of that technology, and who's going to be able to sell their products better than others,” said Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, whose firm invested in Sourcegraph and Poolside, a software development startup that’s building its own AI foundation model.CUSTOM AI MODELSMost of the AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic, which crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue in May in part due to fees paid by code-gen companies. But some startups are attempting to build their own models. In May, Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience. Cursor has also hired a team of researchers to pre-train its own large frontier-level models, which could enable the company to not have to pay foundation model companies so much money, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Startups looking to train their own AI coding models face an uphill battle as it could easily cost millions to buy or rent the computing capacity needed to train a large language model.Replit earlier dropped plans to train its own model. Poolside, which has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model, has announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services and is testing with customers, but hasn’t made any product generally available yet.Another code gen startup Magic Dev, which raised nearly $500 million since 2023, told investors a frontier-level coding model was coming in summer 2024 but hasn’t yet launched a product. Poolside declined to comment. Magic Dev did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: The mounting anxiety over tech jobs is turning ugly

Time Published: 2025-06-03T08:04:01Z

The social network Blind had real juice when I wrote about it in June 2022. It gave 5 million tech workers a place to anonymously talk smack about their employers. Identified only by their workplaces, Blinders traded office gossip, swapped tips on acing technical interviews at places like Apple and Google, and voluntarily shared their Total Compensation — "TC," in the site's argot. Blind served as a giant, freewheeling water cooler for Silicon Valley. Back then, the tech industry was on the verge of what would be a catastrophic downturn in hiring. But Blinders didn't seem worried. They were too busy trying to figure out how to live like kings. How could they boost their TC to stratospheric levels? What were the secrets to climbing the ranks of a FAANG company, or starting a unicorn? Which employers offered the most lavish perks and the best work-life balance? Here and there, I noticed that a few Blinders were starting to wonder if they should get out of tech before all the jobs disappeared. But the overall vibe was: What's the best way to get ahead and live the good life? Three years later, tech employment is in free fall. Since its peak in late 2022, the industry has shed 175,000 jobs. Artificial intelligence is threatening to make the work of coders obsolete, and companies like Meta and Google are slashing perks, gutting middle management, ordering everyone back to the office, and putting employees on performance improvement plans designed to weed out low performers. Tech's role in our lives has never been more ascendant, but as far as the actual business goes, what seemed like a cyclical downturn back in 2022 has become a full-scale apocalypse. So it seemed like a good time to head back to Blind and see how people are feeling. What are workers in the tech industry saying, in the place where they have no fears about speaking their mind? How are Blinders handling the seismic shift taking place in Silicon Valley? The short answer is: not well. Gone is the single-minded focus on fat salaries and work-life balance. Today the site is suffused with a palpable, sour anxiety. Blinders grouse about being ghosted by job recruiters. They rail against the performance plans being implemented by their employers. Even worse, they accuse one another of lying and cheating. In the old days, Blinders treated each other with respect. The platform felt like something unheard of in the age of Twitter trolling: a true community. But now, not unlike much of the internet, Blind is infused with caustic racism and misogyny. Nobody trusts anyone, and everyone is very tired. Blind used to be a friendly and supportive place for the Lords of Tech to celebrate their ascendancy. Now it's devolved into "Lord of the Flies." Everyone on Blind still hopes they're gonna make it big someday. It just seems less likely now. Many Blinders are out of work and scrambling to find a job. They argue about the value of sites like LeetCode, which offers coding education tailored to FAANG interviews. They worry about spending a year studying for their big Amazon interview and then blowing it. And those who do have a job are either looking for a new one, or fretting about how little they make. "Does anyone here feel like dying because of their low TC?" asked one poster. After four years on the job, they said, their total compensation is stalled at $81,000. "Been feeling this lately," replied a Blinder who works at SoFi. There's often a weird sense of entitlement when Blinders talk about their compensation. Even with an AI earthquake sending shockwaves up and down Silicon Valley, they still make way more than most Americans — and they kvetch about it anyway. The person at SoFi who feels like dying over their measly pay? "I'm not even at $500k yet," they complained. "TC $415k." (For context, median income in America is under $50,000. In computer and information technology, it's around $106,000.) Compensation envy on Blind was common back in 2022. But now, when Blinders share their TC, they're often attacked as liars or trolls. Sometimes people are even accused of inventing entire jobs. "Job market is so fucked right now, all those multi-offer postings are by maga supporters," one Blinder posted, dismissing anyone claiming that they'd received multiple job offers at once as a right-wing propagandist. In the current struggle for survival, trust has effectively evaporated. It's every coder for themself — and if you claim to have a great job or a high TC, you must be making it up. One of the biggest anxieties on Blind right now involves performance improvement plans. Nobody enjoys being watched closely by their boss, but Blinders seem to feel that PIPs are more than just an evaluation tool. Some see them as a form of tyranny — something inept middle managers use to meet metrics for firing people, not a test of pure coding skill. Others see any opposition to PIPs as a betrayal of the grindcore mindset — if you're scared of a PIP, maybe the low performer is you, bro! "I moved from Amazon to Microsoft because the PIP culture at Amazon completely burned me out," one Blinder wrote. "The whole thing really messed with me mentally, and I promised myself I'd never go through something like that again. Fast forward to today and Microsoft is now rolling out PIP." The poster despaired of ever being free of the constant scrutiny. "Do you need to go to a fucking startup or something??" they wrote. The pile-on began. Some accused the Blinder of being a subpar coder who was too inflexible to take criticism. Others then accused those Blinders of being managers who were too insecure to acknowledge that PIPs are destroying the spirit of teamwork that attracted so many workers to the tech industry. It felt like every other social media platform: a toxic stew of mistrust and recrimination. One thing almost everyone seemed to agree on? That morale is especially terrible at Meta right now. "We are all hired mercenaries chasing high TC," one Meta employee lamented. Others complained about grueling hours and what they see as a culture of backstabbing. "I'm at Meta," another Blinder wrote. "God I wish I wasn't. And yes I'm interviewing to make that change happen asap. When I started a year ago I thought, 'Blind suffers from selection bias, etc., it will be just fine and like any big tech company.' Nah dawg. It be bad." The point here isn't whether the Blinders are right. It's that in the wake of massive layoffs, many tech workers have sunk into a deep pit of paranoia, finger-pointing — and worse. Back in 2022, I didn't see much racism and misogyny on the platform. Now it's everywhere. Blind recently boasted that it had 12 million registered users, primarily because of its expansion into South Korea and India. Blinders might be turning up the racism dial in response to the newbies. But it's also true that tech in general is suffering from an outbreak of toxic bro-ism. As a team of sociologists wrote of the tech sector in 2023, "The most striking workplace development in recent years may well be the surfacing of a culture of gloves-off sexism and racism at some firms." The field has long been dominated by young white men; more recently, women and people of color have begun to make gains. A lot of the guys on Blind are quick to blame their woes on DEI. One Blinder — a self-described "Indian American born in the USA" — uncorked a truly vile tirade against "Indian women managers." it ranged from stereotyping about people who are "fresh off the boat" to derogatory speculation about their love lives to outright calling them "overweight and ugly." In another post, a Blinder from Adobe asked a workplace etiquette question. "Co-worker brings Indian food to desk and whole aisle smells like food," they wrote. "How to be respectful and say no to this habit?" A Blinder from Pinterest tried to step in. "I'm going to assume that this question was asked in good faith," they wrote. "But next time rather than pointing out the cuisine specifically, just say that they brought 'ethnic food' to the office and the smell is particularly strong." Their heart was in the right place — or at least near it. But the next exchange obliterated any goodwill: Apple: Bring big fat beef steak , and make sure to eat in front of him loudly … He will stop eating at desk afterwards. Instacart: Stop overreacting you pos. You can eat fish, beef and all the crap that stinks but it's only Indian food that bothers you. Prick. Corum: You are the one overreacting. The OP asked the question respectfully. Indian food is really pungent compared to a ham sandwich. In a sense, 'twas ever thus. Silicon Valley has long struggled with racism and misogyny. As those sociologists wrote, modern tech was founded in part on "an exploitative guest worker program that prioritized entry for East and South Asian engineers starting in the 1960s." But the Blind I remembered didn't indulge in X-style hyperpolarization. Today, the shrapnel explodes in all directions. Men on Blind accuse each other of lying about how much they exercise, and how many women they have sex with. Men who claim to be of Indian descent ask other Indian men how to deal with their white American wives who want to have jobs. Blind's recent growth has also come from more women joining the network — and for them, this nonsense is exhausting. "If you choose a career you are a feminist," a worker from Amazon posted in a channel called Women in Core Tech. "If you don't have a career you are a gold digger. If you have an opinion you are argumentative, if you don't have one you are boring. It's like they were expecting pets and don't know how to deal with an entire other gender of humans." A few men replied sympathetically — sorry you're dealing with this, it sucks, etc. They got called simps. A Googler responded with a chart from the Financial Times showing a global divergence in politics between men (who are growing more conservative) and women (who are growing more liberal). The Googler cited it as evidence that women have taken up "woke moral purity as a substitute for religion." The going has gotten tough in tech. Things are falling apart. Today, the open, communal vibe I encountered on Blind back in 2022 seems like a relic of some long-forgetten age. A spokesperson for the network tells me that, according to their data, the percentage of posts that use discriminatory language has actually decreased slightly since 2022. But the overall volume of posts has grown, so "the absolute number of problematic posts may rise." Whatever the math, I was heartbroken to see that Blind, too, has gone feral. In the boom days of tech, the platform's homepage used to have a running ticker in the upper right corner cycling through a list of current job openings, many of which offered remarkably high levels of compensation. It seemed like both goal and enticement, a mutually agreed-upon brass ring for those who had decided to make a career in tech. Now the ticker, along with many of the jobs it used to list, is gone. For Blinders, all that's left is a dystopian cesspool of snark — most of it directed not at the external forces reshaping their livelihoods, but at one another. For millions of beleaguered, burned-out users, it's one more indignity to bear as they struggle to hang on to what little hope they have left.

Title: Business Insider slashes 21% of workforce amid strategic pivot toward AI

Business Insider is cutting 21 percent of its workforce across all departments as part of a restructuring strategy focused on efficiency and long-term sustainability. CEO Barbara Peng said the company is "going all-in on AI," with tools like generative AI search, an AI-powered paywall and broader automation integrated into operations. BI is narrowing its editorial scope to areas like business, tech and innovation, shutting down most of its e-commerce operations and expanding its BI Live events division. The Insider Union condemned the layoffs, calling them a continuation of Axel Springer's "pivot away from journalism toward greed" and criticized the use of AI as a justification for job cuts. The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years.

The Insider Union condemned the layoffs, calling them a continuation of Axel Springer's "pivot away from journalism toward greed" and criticized the use of AI as a justification for job cuts. The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years.

The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years. Business InsiderÂ (BI) is laying off more than one-fifth (21 percent) of its staff as it pivots toward AI-powered content production, streamlined operations and a narrower editorial focus. The cuts, announced by CEO Barbara Peng in a memo to employees on May 29, affect employees across all departments. Peng described the cuts as part of a "leaner, more focused" strategy centered on AI adoption, live events and targeted coverage areas like business, tech and innovation. "We are reducing the size of our organization, a move that will impact about 21 percent of our colleagues and touch every department. This will be a difficult day, and our first priority is to provide clarity and support to those colleagues whose roles are being eliminated," Peng wrote in the memo. Peng indicated in the memo that the media outletÂ will shut down most of its e-commerce operations due to their reliance on search traffic, though a few high-performing verticals will be retained. At the same time, the company plans to expand its BI Live events business â a growing revenue stream that Peng says allows the company to "showcase our journalism, connect directly with our audience and build a strong portfolio of experiences." (Related: Job cuts in mainstream media outlets could lead to AI TAKEOVER of news industry.) Moreover, Peng revealed that BI is "going all-in on AI," citing the rollout of multiple AI-powered tools, including generative AI site search and an AI-driven paywall system. She also teased new AI products on the horizon and suggested that automation will be used across business operations to improve efficiency. Peng also disclosed that BI is narrowing its editorial focus on areas that attract the publication's "most loyal readers," although she did not elaborate on which verticals those are. She noted that 70 percent of the company's business is subject to fluctuations in web traffic and that the organization must be "structured to endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control." The layoffs are effective immediately, with impacted employees receiving direct communication from HR. BI's United Kingdom division is also affected, with a separate downsizing process underway. Insider Union criticizes Business Insider for laying off employees over AI The announcement has drawn strong backlash from the Insider Union, which is affiliated with the NewsGuild of New York. In a scathing statement, the union called the move "another example of Axel Springer's brazen pivot away from journalism toward greed." "We were notified that Business Insider management intends to lay off about 20 percent of our members as part of their ongoing âstrategy' to 'build toward something new,'" the union said. "Let's be clear: This is far from anything new. This is the third round of layoffs in as many years and it is unacceptable that union members and other talented coworkers are again paying the price for the strategic failures of Business Insider's leadership." The union also took sharp aim at the company's AI push, calling Peng's emphasis on automation "tone-deaf" in the context of mass layoffs. "To say this was tone-deaf to include in an email on layoffs would be an understatement," the statement read. "Our position as a union is that no Al tool or technology should or can take the place of human beings." Visit FutureTech.newsÂ for more stories like this.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: MNTN is ad tech’s canary in the coal mine for future public listings
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/mntns-ipo-notes-how-complicated-it-is-to-launch-successfully-compared-to-recent-years/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → MNTN’s initial public offering has revived hopes for ad tech companies eyeing public markets, debuting at $16 per share and quickly rising to $28, with a valuation of $1.2 billion. Backed by Morgan Stanley and linked to Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds (albeit tangentially), the company benefits from a high profile. However, how long will it take for the shine to come off, especially in a year when one of its most readily comparable peers on Wall Street has experienced a significant hit on its stock price? The outfit went public on May 22, 2025, pricing its stock at $16 per share, with the price increasing more than 60% from its IPO price since, a performance suggesting that Wall Street favors it. Still, it faces skepticism over past controversies and limited scale, with $225 million in 2024 revenue equating to a $32.9 million net loss.Meanwhile, observers of the space will recall that MNTN — an outfit known initially, after its founding in 2009, as Steelhouse — has been no stranger to criticism. Those interested further need only look up its (now resolved) legal disputes with Criteo as an example. MNTN’s stockholders will be relieved to hear that several equity analysts told Digiday that investors focus on revenue or profitability impacts, not just allegations. However, success demands flawless execution amid macroeconomic uncertainty, and action on said allegations could soon prove a drag on its price. “Fraud allegations are common in the space and usually don’t have a sustained impact on the stock price,” noted one. Mark Zgutowicz, a managing director at The Benchmark Company who analyzes stocks such as Criteo, LiveRamp, and The Trade Desk, noted that ongoing concerns around tariffs and their impact on consumer incomes are “the elephant in the room” for such companies’ stock prices. It is in this context that such companies, as well as MNTN, must continue to show the robust nature of their business. Zgutowicz said The Trade Desk’s Q4 miss was minor and the stock overreacted, and that Benchmark was upgrading it to a neutral position for its earlier sales rating. “With Criteo, I think the expectations were set too high for them, and they’re owning up to that,” he added. “LiveRamp, I think, is managing through the macro[environment] better because their expectations were set more appropriately.” Karsten Weide, founder of W Media Research, noted how ad tech IPOs are tougher now than in the mid-2010s or early 2020s, primarily because the ‘growth at all costs’ era has eroded. “Today, in 2025, Wall Street wants to see profitability and transparency, skeptical of ad tech’s complexity,” he noted. “AI’s impact and competition from giants like Google make it harder for companies like MNTN to succeed and stand out.” “Amazon realizes it has missed the boat on display advertising, so it is concentrating on using Fire TV and Prime Video as a Trojan Horse,” noted one source when commenting on Amazon’s fresh attempts to overhaul its market share in the DSP sector. — An anonymous agency source The winners and losers of Google’s AI Mode The Sellout Erich Wasserman, former MediaMath sales chief, Dominic Joseph, former CEO of Capitfy and Myles Younger, now of U. of Digital discuss their creative pasts with Paul Knegten, formerly the CMO of Beeswax and Outbrain, in a weekly mini-series that debuts on June 4. Google judge mulls softer remedies in US search antitrust case U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard closing arguments on May 30 at a trial on proposals to address Google’s search monopoly, suggesting he is considering making Alphabet’s Google take less aggressive measures to restore competition in online search than the 10-year regime proposed by antitrust enforcers. What’s On The Agenda For Michael Komasinski, Criteo’s New Chief? AdExchanger talks with Criteo chief Michael Komasinski after he took the hot seat in the first half of 2025, noting how even with Google Chrome’s U-turn on third-party cookies, that, “We see the potential future of agentic shopping as a big opportunity for Criteo.” A Guide to Smarter Advertising and Sustainable Growth in Connected TelevisionID5 notes how addressability is a major challenge for CTV advertising. Agencies and SSPs are pairing up for partnership deals, driven by demand for premium inventory and greater transparency. Will Doherty, svp of inventory development, teases launch at IAB Tech Lab Summit, claiming 90% of Deal IDs are ‘effectively failed’. The move was likely a cost-savings effort, which would mean that Publicis most likely offered to secure lower rates for the entertainment company’s marketing efforts.

Title: Some game developers are trying to justify $80 games
URL: https://www.xda-developers.com/game-developers-justify-expensive-games/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T01:00:19Z
Full Content:
Gaming as a hobby is appearing to get more expensive. With the rise in prices for hardware and other aspects of video games, everyone is going to have to shell out more to engage with their favorite pastime. However, while the price of home game consoles and PC gaming has increased over time, one aspect of video games that's attracting a lot of debate is the price of individual releases. Not that long ago, it felt like $60 would be enough to buy most new releases that would come out at retail. But now it seems some developers are aiming to reach an $80 price point for their newest releases. And most players are not happy about it. Much of this has to do with the changing economic times of the world, but most of what affects video games comes from within the industry itself. And as people struggle with the reality of games costing more, some developers are trying to be as honest as possible about why their games will garner a higher price tag. Change is coming in a very real way, and it's going to affect how everyone engages with video games as a hobby. But what are the legitimate reasons why games will cost more money? Here's how developers are trying to justify why games costing $80 moving forward are the right move for everyone. Nintendo making Mario Kart World cost $80 received a ton of backlash, but they can justify it if the game has enough content now and in the future Making a video game and releasing it to the public costs a lot of money. Most AAA game releases that we see on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will cost millions of dollars to put together and be ready for release on specific platforms. But when you add the necessity of getting the attention of potential customers, the numbers get even higher. So before you know it, one game could have a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, all before anybody knows whether it will be a success. But what's scarier is that the overall cost of all this is getting even higher than before, affecting nearly every game developer. This is why new games like Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2 are going to cost $80 on release. A lot of effects of the increasing cost of making games are being seen in the frequent layoffs and turnover within the gaming industry itself. Some companies just don't have the resources to sustain groups of people during or after the completion of a project, and in some of the worst cases, cancellations. One way to help offset this is to have games cost more at retail, putting much of the burden on customers to help solve the problem. In theory, this could work, but there are many factors that could affect why this may or may not be the best course of action. Regardless, this is where many in the industry are leaning. Releasing a game doesn't just mean doing so within the country it's developed in anymore. The majority of games that are made end up having releases in multiple regions, sometimes a simultaneous worldwide release for bigger games. This can help reach more players/customers in other territories and hopefully increase the revenue generated, but one small problem has been growing recently. Changes in policy between countries, such as the amount of money used to pay tariffs on goods. This affects many companies, especially bigger game companies that make consoles, and forces them to find solutions to compensate for the extra billing. Many have pointed to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been reported to have some issues stemming from the incoming tariffs in the United States. Microsoft recently increased the prices of all its Xbox hardware releases, as well as the prices of games for its Xbox consoles. While the company did not explicitly say tariffs were the reason, many believe it to be because other companies are taking similar actions with their own products. Reports online cited Amazon's Jeff Bezos when he discussed showing the cost of tariffs on certain items sold through Amazon in North America. If it costs more to release products in different parts of the world, that money will come from somewhere, which will most likely be from the customers making the purchase. Microsoft joins in on increasing prices for hardware and software. Get ready to pay more... There's another aspect of this that has been in practice already for some time. Games that have come out at the $60 price point have not always contained the full amount of content developed for them, with publishers opting to have season passes with additional downloadable content available. These expansions end up boosting the price of new releases above the $60 price tag and sometimes into the $100 range to get the full experience and complete amount of content. Instead of having a partial $60 release, the option of having an $80 or more version with everything in there seems like a premium deal. This practice has grown in recent years because studios are trying to find ways around the rising cost of development. And while some studios with big releases have been able to make this work, others have not found the same level of success, but rather harsh criticism from players. Most gamers who are eagerly awaiting Grand Theft Auto VI are going to be open to paying $80 or more for the game, mostly due to the notoriety of the series and anticipation of the new release. However, not every studio has a brand or name that garners that same level of power from players, yet more companies will see this happen and use the same tactics. To some, it comes off more as locking away content that could otherwise be added to the standard release, for the sake of profit. Although it's a smart business move that any studio would find viable, it affects the trust of players who would buy games. Whether everyone wants to admit it or not, change is coming to how we buy video games. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the rising cost of games in stores or digital storefronts, especially when the price of releasing video games to the public continues to go up. Studios are going to continue to find alternatives to how they can balance out the cost and profit of game releases, even if the emotional reaction from players is not always favorable. As sad as it might make us all, change is coming to the price of games, and we're all going to have to deal with it. The Nintendo Switch 2 is almost here. But is it less than what it really needed to be for everyone? We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Yes, all of these motivations for rising prices are correct, but the market is also much larger than it was a decade or two ago, so the development cost should be split between more customers. The bottom line is most big publishers are making bigger profits than ever before. They're not running out of money. Another angle is what the market will bear. Most people already wait for Ubisoft games to go on sale for $30, for instance, that's not going to change if the MSRP goes up and median income doesn't. Here are some SNES games that will likely never come to Nintendo Switch Online. Here are the ten games that define the NES. Before steam, there was MS-DOS, which ran a bevy of "new-age" games. These games would go on to become some of the most important in the medium. Despite many having great things to say about Doom: The Dark Ages, it seems that Xbox Game Pass may have hurt its sales upon release. There's a new GPU champion in town. Psst, NotebookLM isn't just an excellent study buddy

Title: How to uplift Canadian game makers? We asked them
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/02/canadian-gaming-industry-lack-of-recognition-greater-support/
Time Published: 2025-06-02T16:28:59Z
Full Content:
Over a year ago, I wrote a column titled “The Canadian video game industry deserves more recognition.” Despite being a relatively small country, Canada has a multi-billion-dollar gaming sector that’s among the biggest in the entire world, responsible for such globally beloved giants as Mass Effect, Dead by Daylight and Warframe, and indie darlings like Cuphead, Balatro and 1000xResist. And yet, few people seem to know about any of that. Much in the same way that Toronto’s Matt Johnson, the co-writer and director of 2023’s fantastic BlackBerry film, has talked about Canada getting little credit “on the world stage” for effectively inventing the smartphone, our national game creators don’t get much recognition for their significant contributions to pop culture. This was the impetus for my January 2024 column, although I wasn’t expecting it to strike such a chord. Before long, I had received hundreds of likes, comments and messages across social media, especially LinkedIn, with many Canadian game makers echoing my sentiment. Clearly, there was more to explore here. And explore that I did. Over the course of the past year and change, I’ve asked dozens of Canadian developers, actors, lobbyists and the like about how we can address this lack of recognition for our massive gaming industry. Some, admittedly, didn’t really have an answer, and that’s completely understandable. Others, meanwhile, presented all kinds of solutions, offering a great starting point for deeper conversations. And throughout all of this, U.S. government started launching vile and unwarranted attacks against Canadian sovereignty, which has only made these conversations about better supporting each other all the more important. In other words, how can we help Canada’s massive gaming industry get the recognition and support it deserves? Jayson Hilchie (former president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): We need people to understand how big the video game industry is in Canada that have nothing to do with the video game industry. When you live in a town and you have General Motors, or you have Ford and someone works there — when you say, “I work at Ford,” everybody knows what that means. But even to this day, with [about 34,000 people contributing $5.1 billion] to the Canadian economy, when you tell someone you work in the video game industry, they always still go, “Oh, really? That’s interesting.” But they don’t know what that means. For me, at least, how do we get working in the video game industry to be almost normalized and respected in a way where people are either not surprised or curious? It’d be great if we got to a spot where you could say, “Yeah, I work at Ubisoft, I work on Assassin’s Creed.” And people go, “Cool! And they know what that is.” But we’re not there. And it is still surprising to me, given how many people work in the industry, and also how ubiquitous video games have become, that we still have those types of responses. And I really think that until we get to that point [of] the average person understanding the impact of the industry that we’re going to have a depreciated level of respect across the country. Paul Fogolin (current president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): I’ve worked really hard over the last five or six years to help promote [the industry] to government officials [as the ESAC’s former vice president of policy and government affairs], but there’s just more work to do. It’s not just the MPs in Ottawa, it’s MPPs and MLAs across the country. It’s even councillors and mayors. The City of Toronto actually formed an esports working group, and we were invited to be a part of it, and I’d like to see more of those sorts of things. Interactive Ontario was there. We were there. The tourism people, the esports [people], academics [were there]. So we could do more to speak to player audiences and more to decision makers. The more that we get out there and we tell our story, the more people will start to realize. Remy Siu (founder of Vancouver’s Sunset Visitor, creative director of 1000xResist): I think maybe it’s time for the broader public and media in Canada to realize that Canadian indie games are one of the biggest cultural exports in the country, in the sense of new IP. People around the world may not know Canadian TV shows, for example, but I’m pretty sure they’ve played a Canadian indie game before. Have they played Celeste? Inscryption? Balatro? There’s always talk of how it’s a struggle (and it is) to get Canadian content made and distributed, but indie games are making Canadian content and being distributed to a wide global audience, and also being celebrated on the international stage for their work. Perhaps it’s time to look at these Canadian-made homegrown indie games, with the same sense of some beloved Canadian literature and content, and find a way to catalogue and celebrate them into the future. Vancouver-based Sunset Visitor’s 1000xResist won numerous awards last year, including a prestigious Peabody. (Image credit: Sunset Visitor) Navid Khavari (Ubisoft Toronto narrative director, Star Wars Outlaws): We have a wonderful team — a lot of the [Outlaws] story team is based in Ubisoft Toronto, and we’ve been developing this with our partners at [lead developer] Massive [Entertainment] in Sweden for years. We have a lot of great animators as well within [Toronto] studio, and folks from Ubisoft Montreal that have been contributing. All of the cinematics that we’ve shot have been in studios within Ubisoft Toronto and Ubisoft Montreal. So there’s absolutely just a huge wellspring of talent from Canada that’s been contributing to the game and giving some of that Canadian spirit and flavour, I think, to it. And it’s a beautiful thing with Ubisoft as well that we’re able to do that — that we’re able to work together across an entire ocean and it still feels cohesive. And I think it’s to the studio’s credit, to the talent we have across Canada, to be honest, that I think we’re able to hit the quality of bringing a Star Wars open-world game to life. Marc-Alexis Côté (Ubisoft’s vice president and executive producer of the Assassin’s Creed franchise): I think we should be proud of what we can accomplish in Canada. It’s one of the things I was telling the team recently. We have a talent to be able to build those games that’s very rare in the world — to be able to work together in such a way. There’s over 500 people in Quebec City who worked on [Assassin’s Creed Shadows]. We’ve got people in Montreal. We’ve got a few people in Toronto as well. But it’s like one big family coming together to be able to build those games. And I think it’s exciting. And I think it’s something we should promote more: our craft. Because we are very creative people, and I think we should be proud of that as a country and not hesitate to show it to the world. I think we should promote video games as art more globally — not just within Canada, but like globally. And be proud of it. When you look at the games that we build now, the investment, the talent, the passion that it requires, I can only hope that one day, video games are recognized with the same exposure as movies or music. But I think with the younger generations, for them, gaming is an extension of their life, so I think it’s going to take more and more players, and we just need to keep showing to the world the beautiful games that we can create. And I think our games need to speak for themselves more than us speak about our games in a way. So the more fun they will be, the more people they will draw in, and the more naturally people will look at us to see what the next big thing is. Carl-Edwin Michel (creator of the Canadian Game Awards): This community needs to be celebrated. It’s just an unfortunate situation. [Canada is] the third largest creator of video games in the world, and we don’t have our own celebration. That doesn’t make sense. The UK has one with the BAFTAs. Obviously, [there’s] The Game Awards [in the U.S.]. There’s so many different ones — D.I.C.E. [in Las Vegas], etc. There’s so many game awards, but there’s no real celebration of our industry […] The video game industry is covered in tech publications or in finance publications when it comes to, “This studio has millions of dollars of investment,” or “This studio is closing or they have layoffs.” That’s usually how the video game industry is covered […] I’m watching Breakfast Television in the morning and they have an entertainment segment and they talk about movies, they talk about TVs, they talk about music. Why don’t they talk about video games? It’s an entertainment medium that’s bigger than the movie and TV business combined. So why don’t we cover this industry as art, as a medium that’s consumed by millions and millions of people? Ubisoft Quebec’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. (Image credit: Ubisoft) Jennifer Hale (Canadian-American actress in Mass Effect, Metal Gear, The Long Dark and more): That’s a piece of the Canadian culture: you don’t brag on yourself. You just don’t. A little [more] celebration might be in order! Leslie Quinton (Ubisoft’s vice president of communications, North America): We kind of punch above our weight, Canada, if you think about our population, in terms of our involvement in those kinds of high-level entertainment things. So the idea is that we definitely have this capacity in Canada. Maybe we’re too “Canadian modest.” We’re too humble! Prakash Amarasooriya (founder and CEO of Toronto-based pop-culture concert company Kashamara Productions): I think a lot of times, Canada hasn’t been seen as globally for its identity in the arts, which is really unfortunate, because we have actually quite a lot of talent. I think it’s just a reputation of being so close to the [U.S.] that we’re so often overlooked. A lot of our biggest stars are in the States, just because of the bigger market. And a lot of times, the Canadian identity also follows suit. And so we don’t get to hone that here. And I’ll be honest, I think Canada can do a lot better job of highlighting a lot of what we have to offer and showcase, “This is what the Canadian identity is about.” I think there’s a lot of opportunity here because of the fact that our Canadian identity is so diverse. And that’s why you have a South Asian man running a company that puts on Japanese projects, as well as other international projects, in a space that’s predominantly European. And I think that just speaks to what Canada is all about — that that can make sense here and also can be successful here. Scott Christian (Toronto’s Hilltop Studios co-founder, creative director, writer and composer on Lil’ Guardsman): I think the issue is how much does a game being made in Canada matter to gamers? There’s obviously a massive push right now to support Canadian-made, but the challenge for developers and publishers is how small relative to the American and international markets the Canadian market is. That being said, the work done by our small but mighty Canadian games media has an impact. I think there’s an opportunity for publishers of Canadian games to create sales, bundles, and events that take advantage of this moment for Canadian creators. But like I said, it’s a tough business case with our relatively small population. […] It would be wonderful to see a Canadian politician give the kind of recognition that France’s president recently lavished on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developers in the wake of its success. [Editor’s note: the last time we saw something on this scale was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting about Cuphead‘s The Game Awards wins in 2017.] BioWare Edmonton’s Mass Effect series is one of the most beloved in the entire medium. (Image credit: BioWare) Lucie Lalumière (president and CEO of Interactive Ontario): We’ve seen growing awareness of Canada’s world-class video game industry, thanks in large part to journalists and influencers like you, as well as to a wave of grassroots, institutional, and business-led initiatives across the country. A standout example is that in 2025, the City of Toronto declared June as Video Game Month, the first time a Canadian city has made such a bold and public commitment to celebrate our sector. With over 30 events (and counting) planned across June and July, including Toronto Games Week and Giant Video Games, the public will experience the depth and diversity of our video game ecosystem. Funké Joseph (co-founder of Toronto-based Play Underground Games, winner of the Ubisoft Indie Series 2024): A lot of the [local] devs are super welcoming to us […] It clicked for me that Ontario is the spot — Toronto feels so good for making games. And I used to feel like we were so removed from the whole process with things being so L.A.-based and American or just global events. I was like, “It’s not even happening close to home.” But to see how warm and welcoming everyone is? It’s great […] It’s helpful to talk to people and just see all the people, especially at Ubisoft, that went through that experience with us. Jayson Hilchie: Back in 2019, we humanized the people who make video games and interviewed them in their studios [for a video series]. And they talked to us about what they did, where they were from, and how they got into the industry. I’ve been speaking about this since — how do we humanize the people who make games? And any way that we can, we can do that, whether it’s through videos, or whether it’s through interviews, or whether it’s through documentaries — all those things are going to help […] [But] we’re not hitting the average person with those videos. I doubt that they’re getting hit with [documentaries], either. [Electric Playground creator] Victor Lucas has said this numerous times — we’re just not getting the respect on TV. There’s no video game shows on TV. There’s video game shows on YouTube, the video game shows on the web, but there’s no video game shows on TV anymore. When you come home after school, you’re not seeing a show about video games. That used to be normal. And the video game industry has kind of inversely outpaced the TV focus on our industry. Like, we got a lot of focus in the ’90s when we weren’t that big. And now, we’re massive, and there’s nothing. So how do we increase mainstream media exposure of our industry when we’re massive, but there’s just no interest? I agree with Vic on that, it’s a little perplexing. Vancouver-based The Coalition’s Gears 5. (Image credit: Xbox) Rod Fergusson (Blizzard Entertainment’s general manager of Diablo, former longtime producer on Gears of War): I think it’s just trying to represent [Canadian developers] more. I tried to do that when I was in Vancouver at The Coalition. That’s my relationship with Victor [Lucas], and why [I was at Fan Expo] — the notion of being able to try to support the Canadian industry and try to have a little bit more representation. But we never really talked about [how] Gears 4 and Gears 5 were Canadian-made games. But you’re right. When you look at Vancouver and the BioWare stuff and all of the Ubisoft stuff in Montreal, there’s a lot of games here, but we don’t really trumpet it out that “There’s our Canadian games.” So I think it’s more about how we build recognition. But again, it goes down to people. Because I am Canadian, and I tended to be the face of Gears, I tried to be a little bit more out there. But when you think about the two founders of BioWare who retired, the doctors [Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, who co-founded the studio alongside Augustine Yip]… There isn’t really a face of Ubisoft in Montreal. Who’s the personality? And so I think that’s something that’s missing — we don’t have the “movie director face” in the Canadian industry. Who’s the “Vancouver person?” Now that I’m not there, who’s the face of The Coalition right now? They don’t really have one. Who’s the face of all the other stuff? There’s a very great thriving industry in Vancouver, but there aren’t a lot of faces. So I think if we could get more personalities to pop, then we can bring more attention to it. Megan Everett (director of community and live ops at London, Ontario’s Digital Extremes, Warframe): I didn’t even know DE existed and I’ve lived [in London] my entire life. I had no idea it existed. And for obvious reasons, we keep it a little more secret for safety reasons. But we’ve been trying more and more to kind of go that “Canadian grassroots” route [in DE’s popular community videos.] [Creative director] Rebb [Ford] has recently been saying a lot that we’re very “Wayne’s World” in our approach to how we appear and goof off and do that with our players. So I think we’re trying to leverage the more “Canadian-isms” that we have. Leslie Quinton: We had an event [in 2022] where we brought fans in and it was amazing. They were taking pictures of computers that were turned off saying, ‘This is where Rainbow Six is made!” And they were so excited. So we want to show that openness, because there’s not at all a hidden agenda. And also, we need more people in tech. There are simply not enough people — not just in video games, but technology in general. So showing people all the interesting sides to it is obviously in our interest and the interest of the industry. So part of it is making sure we continue to be very visible — these university competitions we do [like the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition] have great visibility and are extremely appealing. Matthieu Dupont (Gameloft Montreal studio head, Disney Dreamlight Valley): I feel putting forward the people who are making the game, so not only the studio heads and the execs, but also the Canadian developers, the Quebecois developers, the Ontarian developers that are working on the game, doing the code, the graphics, the design, [letting] them speak at events, gather them into cross-studio industry events… And hopefully, people start to notice. We have a lot of success, but if you ask players, they don’t necessarily know where the game has been made. Sometimes they don’t care as well; they just want to enjoy the game. But even industry-wise, I think we can do better of giving the mic to developers and let them speak for themselves. Jennifer Hale: One of the things I want to do is reach out to indie devs in Canada, especially. I want to work with Canadian indie devs. I want to support them. It’s not even about me having a role in the game. What I want to focus on is, “How can I support you? How can we all connect?” I have witnessed — quite directly, unfortunately — a disconnect between the Canadian actors union in B.C. and indie developers. I experienced some quite antagonistic stuff that shocked me, honestly, and made me want to reach very directly out to devs to see what I can do to support them. Humberly González giving a rare performance-capture demonstration at Ubisoft Toronto for Star Wars Outlaws. Humberly González (Venezuelan-Canadian actress, Star Wars Outlaws, Ginny & Georgia): I really believe in Canadian talent — there are incredible artists there that maybe sometimes get overlooked because we’re on the other side of the border. But the reality is that they come to us and they cast locally because there is talent. Sometimes the odd one makes it out and they go, “Oh, my goodness,” or when I meet fans and I tell them that I’m based out of Toronto and that we shot the show here, or the movie here, or the game here, and they go, “Really?” And I go, “Yeah! A lot of our cast is actually Canadian.” There are a lot of opportunities [in Canada]. There’s people who are such creators, especially in Toronto — there’s a very creative indie scene, and there’s people who go to school there and stay there and live there. And I think it is such a melting pot of so many different cultures and languages and food. I love Toronto, I love living [here]. Amanda Farough (Canadian game writer, producer, consultant and analyst, Strange Scaffold): We need to be loud, we need to be proud, and we need to keep moving that mission forward — that Canadian games are some of the best games in the world. 1000xResist wouldn’t exist if not for government funding, and, quite frankly, other Canadians taking a chance on a brand-new studio […] We need more of that: more Canadian stories, more stories that celebrate the mosaic of our culture, not the homogeny of our culture, because it’s not homogenous. That is the thing that makes Canada so strong and so beautiful: we are telling distinctly Canadian stories through places like through stories like Venba. That is a distinctly Canadian story, but you wouldn’t know that unless you’re Canadian, unless you, too, grew up in your own diaspora, or you, too, grew up alongside a diaspora. I’m just a white girl from Kamloops, but my friends growing up, a good chunk of them [and] their families, were from all over the globe, and I grew up eating foods that other white kids weren’t eating, and it was such a beautiful education for the kind of life I wanted to live and the kind of life I wanted for my future children. And I love the mosaic of our culture, and we need more stories, more studios, more funding, and louder people to advocate for how amazing the Canadian mosaic is. And it doesn’t have to be stereotypical. Our stories are quiet. That’s what makes our stories so impactful, is that they’re quiet. They’re unassuming. But as Canadians and as Canadian developers, we have to be a lot louder! Venba from Toronto-based Visai Games was one of 2023’s most acclaimed games, winning praise for its strong narrative about an Indo-Canadian family. (Image credit: Visai Games) Jeff Mundee (University of New Brunswick professor, co-founder of Fredericton’s Reframe Games, Noxia Somnia): The thing in New Brunswick is that there’s a lot of communities spread out, and so it’s hard to get people to group and do something more. There’s a lot of hidden game development talent and a lot of game development projects that are hiding out. And I believe that we are stronger together. I want to really push for bringing the groups together and making a go of New Brunswick of being more than just a supplier of talents [and] making more games here. Remy Siu: I think it’s important [to talk about funding] because I really do like thinking about logistics, constraints, and context, and how all those things may affect an artwork. In my previous artistic life, I would watch documentaries about big-name visual artists, working at huge scales, intersecting huge sites, and it would always be awe inspiring, but sometimes I wish they showed how the whole thing was funded — the mundane side of it — how was it produced? I want to see artists in meetings talking to stakeholders and institutions. How did they convince people to do it? To fund it? Maybe that might seem boring to the general watching audience, but I’m sometimes worried that the general populace may think an artist has an idea and then just kind of waves their hand and makes it happen. Whereas, in my experience, most artists are working within tight constraints, and how they deal with those constraints have as much to do with the art as anything. Manda Farough: There are so many studios out there that are dying because there is no money, and the money that is out there is from really questionable places sometimes. I’m not saying universally, but in the United States, which is where I live now, there’s no grants. There’s no funding down here. We don’t have the Canada Media Fund down here. We don’t have Ontario Creates. We don’t have B.C. arts funds. Sasha Boersma (co-founder of Toronto’s Sticky Brain Studios, Rooster): [Our point-and-click Chinese culture and community game Rooster] is heavy on art and animation and wanting it to look right and feel right, so it’s all that finessing. We’ve made 12 minigames with very, very, very simple mechanics. But it’s the magic around it. That’s really what’s taxing on the dev team, and so we just put our decisions in a different place. And we can do that thanks to the Canada Media Fund and Ontario Creates — we’re not beholden to what a publisher says we can give. We can try something different, which is why CMF calls it “envelope innovation.” We’re innovating in a way that no publisher would ever give us funding to be able to try. Funké Joseph: If you’re from Canada, there’s a lot of opportunities to get funding — to prototype, to make something bigger that you want to get commercial — in so many different places in our country. Because not many other places have those opportunities. So I think especially if you’re in Canada, look into those different grants and funding options, and apply. Sometimes, people are like, “I don’t know if I should apply.” Apply! They want people to apply to these things because otherwise, they’re not going to be giving out money. They just want creative projects, a lot of these funders. So if you have that fire, there’s people that can help fund you for “X amount of time” to make that into whatever you want with that idea. So I just want people to know what’s possible and look it up. Lil’ Guardsman is the debut title from Toronto’s Hilltop Studios and has garnered significant acclaim. (Image credit: Hilltop Studios) Lucie Lalumière: Canada has the techno-creative talent. We have the entrepreneurial drive. But we’re not yet seizing the full market opportunity in front of us. The global video game industry now generates more revenue than the film and music industries combined, a clear signal of its cultural influence and economic weight. Take Ontario as an example. While it produces globally successful games across all genres and platforms; develops top-tier techno-creative talent; and represents roughly 40 per cent of Canada’s population; it holds only about 20 per cent of the country’s video game jobs. To bridge that gap and truly compete on a global scale, we need to: cut red tape around existing business incentives; remove barriers to interprovincial collaboration, take bold action to attract and encourage investment and support inbound and outbound international business development. Scott Christian: In so many ways, gaming is borderless. I would love a robust domestic publishing scene, but I don’t think that would have as much impact as increased investment and support for CMF and Ontario Creates grant funding. I think this is what would seed more Canadian and Ontario teams and projects and would have the biggest positive impact. Lil’ Guardsman was supported by a traditional publisher model, which is less and less the norm these days it seems. With Hilltop’s latest project, we applied for these grants, and were successful with one. It’s a lifeline for Canadian developers, and coupled with the OIDMTC (Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit), these programs make it possible for small teams like ours to thrive. These programs work to guarantee that games jobs aren’t leaving the country (or the province with Ontario Creates), which I think is important. Lucie Lalumière: Ontario’s video game ecosystem stands out for its highly skilled and innovative techno-creative talent, diverse and globally minded workforce, entrepreneurial spirit, and economic development incentives, including the new Ontario Creates IP Development Fund and the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit. However, many studios are currently experiencing significant delays in the processing of the tax credit. These delays slow investment in talent and IP development, undermining the credit’s effectiveness and limiting Ontario’s ability to fully capitalize on growing global opportunities. At a time when the video game sector can meaningfully contribute to Ontario’s economy and innovation agenda, this bottleneck is especially concerning. The Ontario government has acknowledged the issue and pledged to address it. The industry is hopeful that a timely solution will help restore this key incentive’s full effectiveness in supporting the growth of Ontario’s video game ecosystem. Mathieu Côté (Montreal’s Behaviour Interactive — game director and head of partnerships on Dead by Daylight): Most of those big companies [in Canada] are not Canadian. Ubisoft is right next door here — they’re French, for the most part. You have Warner Bros., that’s set up not very far away, but they’re American. You’ve got Electronic Arts that has an office, Amazon Games is literally across the street. We have NetEase right there. There’s more and more of those gigantic studios from around the world, which is amazing because it yields a lot of really cool talent, and it makes people grow and it gives people jobs here. But it’s really, really cool to be part of one of the rare Canadian Quebec companies that is still, to this day, very much a Canadian company. Behaviour Interactive, the developer of the massively popular Dead by Daylight, is one of the few major Canadian-owned developers. (Image credit: Behaviour Interactive) Miriam Verburg (CEO and executive producer, Toronto’s Bloom Digital Media, Disney Villains Cursed Cafe): I’ve long supported the idea of developing a publishing fund in Canada […] We could access support for publishing by banding together to create cooperatives to publish together — creating marketing resources that we can share so that we can go out to the wider world with a little bit more ease. And localized games. There is no way to get support for game localization in Canada — like nothing — unless you get a publisher. So if you have a game that’s in English and you want to localize it, you’re just footing the bill yourself and taking that out of revenue, unless you get a publisher, and there are no Canadian publishers. So then if you want to localize your game, you’re going to a publisher in a different country to get your game localized, to get it published, and then that publisher is taking between 50 to 70 per cent of your launch day profits. How can we grow the industry, then? How could we get attention to Canadian games, if we are unwilling to fund anything to do with their sale of marketing? If all we do is go, ‘Okay, let’s, let’s fund production, let’s figure out how to get things made, and then it’s up to the game producers.’ Manda Farough: Let’s be real. What is our publishing landscape at home? It doesn’t really exist [And] what generally tends to go into the back half of putting a game together is you need things like release management — publishing services can do that. You need help with PR, help with marketing, help with working with influencers, localization, quality assurance, localization quality assurance. So I feel like putting together shared resources among developers that have already learned these lessons gives everybody access to knowledge, even if they don’t have access to the services themselves […] Because I think that for the most part, publishing is going to continue to be sparse. There aren’t a ton of independent developers left in the major cities in Canada — all over the place, we’re not even just looking at Ontario or even Quebec. In my home province [B.C.], there were a lot of independent studios once upon a time. It’s too expensive. It’s too expensive to be a developer in Canada a lot of the time, and to scale that, you need equity and you need investment. And that’s also another thing that’s really difficult, private investment, and that’s very difficult to come by in Canada […] Being able to pool those resources is a way to make sure that we’re elevating Canadian developers, and not necessarily putting them at risk, which is nice. Remy Siu: I think we have to figure out a way for banks to bridge-fund indie games at reasonable interest rates, especially based on the milestone systems that most of these funding bodies work on. Both in film and in indie games, the funding bodies expect some level of bridge funding and that can be difficult to get, or expensive […] I’m also not sure why there aren’t more publishers in Canada. I wonder if the digital media tax credits can be extended to those types of entities, for their labour spend (if they don’t already). I will say in Canada, I think we have a lot of self-publishing indie stars! Venba, Slay the Princess, Celeste, and more. Perhaps the culture and environment here does foster the self-publishing indie spirit. Lucie Laumière: Even if more Canadian publishers were to emerge, independent video game studios would still choose partners based not on geography, but on fit. Does the publisher understand the genre? Do they have the right platform relationships? Can they effectively reach the players and influencers in their target markets? Publishing is a global business, and most publishers, Canadian or otherwise, select games based on their market potential, not national origin, unless incentivized to do otherwise. The greater challenge for indie studios isn’t the absence of large-scale Canadian publishers, but the need for more robust support for IP development and commercialization. Today, most publishers expect some level of market validation before committing to a title. That means indie studios must invest early in iterative, market-tested prototyping, marketing and community building to demonstrate a game’s potential. So why not self-publish? Many studios now assume they will, knowing that strong market traction can help attract publishers or investors down the line, and give them greater leverage to negotiate favourable terms if they choose to pursue those partnerships. To keep pace with these industry dynamics, Canada must strengthen its strategic investment in programs like those offered by the Canada Media Fund, particularly to expand support for video game prototyping, marketing and community building. These investments play a critical role in helping Canadian studios bring original IP to market, scale their businesses, and compete in a fast-moving global industry. Carl-Edwin Michel: I actually had that discussion with one of the studios that is coming on board [the CGAs] and they were saying to me that [business-to-business], for them, was the most important thing. Because that’s where they get investors and the support to get their game created. And they were really like, ‘Yeah, the consumer is always going to be there. People are going to buy games. We have the community, it’s fine. And also, we’re a smaller country when you compare us to the U.S. So a PAX or some of those big events, they go to where they think there’ll be a lot of people coming in, and also that they can generate a lot of revenue. I wasn’t in the books of [EGLX], but it was the last big consumer event that we had right in the country. We don’t have to go crazy. We can do something that is decent size and go from there. For me, the Eh! Game Expo [a free public exhibition of demos in Toronto] is a start, and I have a plan to make this thing grow. But I want to grow it organically, and I’m not going to fake it and put investment money to it, and just go to [Scotiabank Arena] or whatever and do something crazy. Strand is the first game from the small new Montreal developer Exnilo Studio. (Image credit: Exnilo) Allie Wilde (PR and marketing lead at Montreal’s Studio Exnilo, Strand): Events like the Eh! Expo are huge for indie devs, especially in Canada, where we don’t have many consumer-facing opportunities like this. Conferences can be really expensive, and like other indie teams, we can’t just dig up loot buried in our backyard to fund every event. So when something like the Eh! Expo comes along, giving us a chance to showcase our game to real players without breaking the bank, it’s massively valuable. Getting direct access to our community and sharing the game hands-on is one of the most important assets we have. As a small team working from home, that can be tough. Seeing players experience Strand in person, watching their reactions, and hearing real-time feedback is crazy valuable. It helps us refine the experience and makes all the difference in shaping the game into something truly special. Beyond just our game, though, there is so much Canadian talent out there. So many emerging studios, all creating amazing work, and we’re all incredibly keen to lift each other up. More events like this wouldn’t just help individual studios, they’d strengthen the entire Canadian gaming scene. We believe “more is more” when it comes to these kinds of opportunities, and we’d love to see even more public-facing gaming events in Canada in the future. Scott Christian: The return of the Canadian Game Awards this year had an impact, and I dream (and scheme) about a “Canadian Indie Games festival” and awards event with a specific focus on Canada’s robust indie game scene. Lucie Lalumière: We’re beginning to see a welcome resurgence of [business to consumer] video game expos in Canada, most notably Game Con Canada in Alberta and the newly announced Video Game Live Expo (VGLX) in Ontario. There are also an increasing number of opportunities for players to engage with games in development, such as The G.R.I.D., a new playtesting-focused event in Toronto […] The province also showcases unique initiatives such as Level Up Showcase, the largest exhibition of student-made games in Canada [and Digital Extremes’] TennoCon, the country’s largest fan event organized by a studio, drawing thousands from around the world to London each year [for Warframe]… On the [business to business] front, Interactive Ontario and our peers at the Canadian Interactive Alliance/l’Alliance Interactive Canadienne (CIAIC) are actively working with XP Gaming Inc. and the Government of Canada to bring international publishers to Canada. Our goal is to create cost-effective, high-impact business opportunities for developers at flagship events like XP Game Summit. Programs like Ontario Creates’ Global Market Development are also essential in supporting international business development, and would benefit from enhanced investment to meet growing demand. That said, the way games are promoted and discovered is evolving. Large-scale in-person/online hybrid showcases like Summer Game Fest; fully digital showcases like Wholesome Games; and global digital storefront campaigns, such as a potential Canada-focused Steam Sale, are becoming vital tools for reaching players, influencers, and industry partners worldwide. That’s why we’re also excited to see new hybrid initiatives emerging in Canada, such as Pixel Power Play in Toronto, which blends public-facing engagement with digital amplification, connecting fans, creators, and influencers, while showcasing Canada’s creative excellence to the world. Thousands of TennoCon attendees wait for a live presentation about the future of Warframe at TennoCon 2024. Megan Everett: Having [our Warframe fan event TennoCon] in London does feel special, because this is where DE has always been. And it gives back to the community, a little bit. It boosts London for hotels, and travel, and people just learn about London. And we try, as we’re doing TennoCon, to let people know best restaurants to go to, bars to go to, libraries to go to. So we’re trying to give back to London as they’ve kind of given us this space. So it’s special to us. And it also is really nice for the employees here being able to bring their family and their friends to it, because most of us are local. So we’re able to have like one big celebration, and you just can’t beat being at home. It’s very comfortable. And logistically, it just makes sense. Dan Vader (game director at Toronto’s Capybara Games, Battle Vision Network): What I love about [something like] Day of the Devs [a non-profit promoting indies] is it puts faces to who makes your games — it shows you the real human beings that are making these things that you love, where they’re from, and I think that’s a great way to demystify the process of making games. It’s just a bunch of people who are inspired to make cool things. There are so many Canadian developers making so many games big and small, and I often get surprised when I find out that this game I’m playing is actually not just from a Canadian dev, but a Toronto dev. I even get surprised by that, and I’m in the industry. And I think if more Canadians, especially young Canadians, knew how big it was, how many opportunities there might be, it might steer the course of their lives. Because when I grew up, I didn’t think video games were made in Canada, I thought they were made somewhere very far off — it was not possible to get into them. And the truth is that there are multitudes of games being made in Canada. These responses have been slightly edited for clarity and length.

Alliance Entertainment is, of course, the company that successful won the auction to buy Diamond Comic Distributors as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, saw Diamond reject that deal, only for the bankruptcy courts to reinstate it, and then for AENT to pull out again, alleging fraud over the way the Wizard Of The Coasts contracts were presented. And is now suing Diamond over these allegations. So, yes, Alliance Entertainment, AENT, the company that is suing Diamond for millions after having tried very hard to acquire the distributor, has just hired five of Diamond's longest-standing staff members, and given them senior positions within the company. AENT boss Bruce Ogilvie is looking smarter by the day. Just as long as he doesn't go on any podcasts to talk about it all.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: What does WPP Media’s course change actually mean for advertisers?

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → GroupM’s rechristening as WPP Media last week was intended to answer questions posed by clients, staffers and industry critics about the future of what was once the industry’s largest media investment house. But beyond the sizzle reel, question marks remain over what’s actually changed — and whether this is the end of WPP’s long-running quest to turn the ship around, or just the latest chapter. In particular, there are queries around the company’s AI ambitions; how close they are to becoming reality; what that reality means for its own employees; and how they help it put clear blue water between itself and rival heavyweight media holdcos Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (soon to include IPG). GroupM is gone, and WPP Media has been set up in its place. Going forward under its new captain Brian Lesser (who is also its old captain), the network will operate with a single P&L model in each country, while the global CEO positions of its constituent agencies have been abolished. Former Wavemaker CEO Toby Jenner has been instead named global chief business officer, while Mindshare’s Adam Gerhart has taken on a brief as chief client officer, for example. “Advertisers don’t like disruption. They don’t like not knowing what’s going to happen with their team. They don’t like when they start spending more time thinking about their own business than their clients,” said Tom Denford, CEO and co-founder of media consultancy ID Comms. This isn’t just about tidying up the org chart, but a significant shakeup in the engine room of WPP. Execs are keen to push the benefits of the bespoke cross-disciplinary teams it’s built for clients like Amazon, Unilever and Coca-Cola. In each case, the custom units combine media, creative and data capabilities, and are built with WPP’s data businesses Choreograph and Infosum (acquired just two months ago) as connective tissue. Lauren Wetzel, CEO of InfoSum, referred to this approach as “showing up as one company.” WPP Media’s leaders believe more clients want the white glove treatment – and a simplified organization structure makes those teams easier to assemble and easier to run. “Clients want us to come together and have an integrated offering,” said Wetzel. Behind the scenes, the changes have already led to significant job cuts at the network, though a WPP spokesperson declined to say exactly how many of its 40,000 staffers were made redundant. Layoffs will continue until at least June, per Ad Age. Incumbent clients, however, are keen to be reassured their own account teams remain in place. They want both continuity of service, and to be reassured they won’t be forgotten when WPP Media goes hunting for new custom in its fresh costume. Perhaps that explains why, despite retiring the 20-year old GroupM moniker (originally intended to manage WPP’s sprawling media agency domains, rather than a market vehicle in its own right) the Mindshare, Wavemaker, and EssenceMediacom agency brands remain intact. Digiday understands that the agency brands will aid WPP Media in navigating potential client conflicts, while also pitching for new work in their own right. According to Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, the remaining firewalls, combined with the addition of Infosum, will also help reassure clients that other advertisers won’t have access to their data. The new structure will “wall off their clients’ first-party data from any losses in data fidelity, or security or privacy concerns,” said Pattisall. WPP Media’s leadership aren’t using the “a” word to describe the new entity. Not that one, anyway. No longer a network of media agencies, WPP Media will instead function as an “AI-driven media company”, per the spiel of a B2B ad campaign it’s launched to float the rebrand. In plain English, that refers to the way its teams use WPP Open, the company’s AI operating system, as well as other AI tools and automation. According to Evan Hanlon, global CEO at WPP data business Choreograph, every team within the business is already using Open to plan and invest media on behalf of clients. This will supposedly free them from the “drudgery” of manual media planning and enable them to pursue more creative solutions. “It’s something that our people are not only in every day, but that our clients are seeing and experiencing and having work delivered for them,” said Hanlon. Even if clients choose only to work with EssenceMediacom or Wavemaker, rather than the cross-border packages WPP Media is prioritizing, they’ll still be customers of teams using Open. “Every client that we onboard now is being onboarded into that end-to-end, AI-powered ecosystem,” said Hanlon. “Through the end of the year, we’re looking to bring 100% of WPP Media onto that workflow as well.” Teams aren’t limited to using WPP’s proprietary toolbox, but can integrate tech that clients have built in-house as well. “We are not putting our clients in a position in which they have to lock into a fixed, inflexible, closed system,” he said. WPP Media isn’t the only media network to have switched to a single P&L, or to remodel its interior around a data business. And it’s far from the only way advertisers can access AI tech. However, Hanlon said WPP Media’s approach to audience data would be the element that helps it stand out from the crowd. Rather than sell access to audience datasets it owns – and compete directly with Meta or Google – WPP Media aims, through InfoSum’s clean room tech, to help clients leverage the first part data they do have, and provide probabilistic audience targeting. It’s a solution clients can’t easily build in-house or get from the tech giants, and one that should keep advertisers above the water line on privacy compliance. “Every one of our competitors is pursuing a strategy that is focused around owning large-scale audience datasets as the focal point for how they extract more value from the marketplace,” said Hanlon. Deterministic approaches, he said, are just “one of many” ways to target media. “We think that is one place that we are fundamentally different to our competitors.” If its leaders can articulate that offer in the pitch room, it could be compelling for clients, according to Sam Tomlinson, chief client officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “WPP Media will need to work through this integration quickly so they can then focus on a clear articulation of the benefits of their data strategy, building on InfoSum and explaining how it is different to their competitors,” he said. Ultimately, Forrester’s Pattisall believes WPP Media as described has a strong chance to improve its fortunes, regardless of whether it keeps any clients that might be in play (such as Mars, which is currently in review and which WPP CEO Mark Read acknowledged is in play back at the end of April). “They’ve made massive acquisitions, they’ve consolidated their operations and they’re providing end-to-end services rather than point solutions,” said Pattisall. “It’s certainly working for Publicis Media, it’s working for Omnicom Media Group … I think it would work for WPP Media as well.” — Michael Bürgi contributed to this report. As influencers and creators capture more attention (and ad dollars) from marketers and agencies looking to break through with prospective customers, Advertiser Perceptions looked into how they’re being used and evaluated, as well as how dollars are being allocated. Some highlights from the study, which surveyed 305 marketing and agency folk: “I would not at all be surprised that sooner than later, influencer [as a] channel will be much bigger than television. I don’t know if it will be in three years or five years, but that’s something which is going to happen.” Agencies and SSPs are pairing up for partnership deals, driven by demand for premium inventory and greater transparency. Will Doherty, svp of inventory development, teases launch at IAB Tech Lab Summit, claiming 90% of Deal IDs are ‘effectively failed’. The move was likely a cost-savings effort, which would mean that Publicis most likely offered to secure lower rates for the entertainment company’s marketing efforts.
