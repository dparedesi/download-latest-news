"We don't see cannibalisation..." "It was five, six years ago we celebrated two million players for the first time," Miles Jacobson tells me, during our lengthy interview with the studio head at Football Manager developer Sports Interactive's office earlier this summer. Checking that reference, it was indeed 2020 when the studio first announced that figure, with some pride. "And then we've really embraced the subscription platforms…" Those platforms - Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus, Apple Arcade, Netflix and more - have had a marked effect on the series. From 2 million players in 2020, the series' playerbase has skyrocketed. "As I sit here today," Jacobson says, in the late summer, "and because I haven't been on social media these numbers haven't been [publicly] updated for a long time, so I'm glad you're sitting down - as of when I last checked, we're at 19.09 million players. Of which, 7.5 million have played for more than five hours. If you play a game for more than five hours, you tend to play for a lot longer." Of those, 2 million people played the game in the month of June alone, Jacobson goes on. "That's for a game that has been out since November 2023." While going through the figures, Jacobson brings up a dashboard on the giant screen he has in his office. Total playtime: 1.7bn hours, for FM24 alone. Average playtime: 118.8 hours, "including all the people that have subscribed and played for an hour and then not come back." Without those, that figure's in the many hundreds. And then the one that stood out the most to me: FM24, as of late this summer, actually had slightly more regular daily players than when it first came out. Two years after release, with no FM25 after that game's shock cancellation and no additional, official updates or data patches to fill the gap, FM24 is effectively bigger than it's ever been. "We have nine times as many players; we have two and a half times the revenue," Jacobson says, before adding quite understandably: "So we're really happy with the partnerships." Those kinds of partnerships have been in the spotlight of late. Back in July, for instance, Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio called Game Pass the "elephant in the room" of the conversation around Xbox parent company Microsoft's large-scale layoffs. He referred to it then as an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit." He added, "I don't think it can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up." The sentiment has some backing - in a continued conversation on X with Michael Douse, director of publishing at Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian, who broadly echoed those points, Colantonio continued: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does." It all makes for interesting context for Football Manager's huge success, something Jacobson attributes quite directly to subscriptions. FM is a relatively unique series of course, in that it's annualised, has theoretically different audience to 'core' games, and is available on such a wide array of platforms, from PC and consoles to tablets and mobile. Nevertheless, Jacobson says there are specific things the studio has done to ensure its success on subscription services. "We built a whole business model around it," he says. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place." Part of that strategy is in building up what Jacobson called a "long-term addressable audience". In other words: those players who play the game for more than five hours. Essentially they become a kind of insurance against subscription revenue suddenly going away. "If the platforms decided they didn't want us anymore, we would know that we have a lot more consumers to talk to," Jacobson explains. As for that revenue, the specifics of the deals these kinds of platforms make with publishers and developers are quite heavily guarded, but Jacobson could speak broadly to how that worked - how, for instance, does getting nine times more players in a game like Football Manager equate to 2.5 times the revenue, when the games don't include any real in-game microtransactions for those extra players to spend on? "Different platforms work in different ways," he says. "Some of them work in a world of up-front fees and royalties. Some of them work in a way of royalties. Those royalties are different for different platforms, so some are based on eyeballs, some are based on playtimes… So what Epic does with their free weeks is very different to what Microsoft does with Game Pass, very different to what Apple Arcade does. Which is very different to what Amazon Prime Days do, which is very different to what Netflix does." An extra upside comes "if your sales don't drop," Jacobson adds, meaning a studio such as Sports Interactive gets the revenue from the royalties and revenue from sales of the games they would've always had. "We don't see cannibalisation, which is an absolute key thing. But we work with a publisher that we've worked with for a long time, who happens to own us as well, who understands the nature of annual iterations." The studio also has a five-year plan, Jacobson says, and publisher Sega its own 10-year plans, which factor in the timing for when certain deals might run out. "We know when our deals are going to run out with these platforms," Jacobson says. "If we can get a deal that makes sense for us, then we will do the deal that makes sense. If we don't… we know how many customers have played for more than five hours, so we know what our target number is going to be to hit that year. So it actually helps us, being able to be in a - I can't say fully 'no-lose' situation - but in most cases we're in a no-lose situation." All that has left Jacobson almost unanimously positive about the services, at least in terms of how they've worked for Football Manager. "We'd love to stay with the partners, we work very, very well together, and it's massively increased our audience - but I don't control their businesses, and with any large business they can pivot, so we've protected ourselves from that, and that's why it was so important to do that long-term plan first." As for that painfully protracted wave of layoffs, Jacobson put much of the industry's difficulty down to games' increasing competition for attention: "We are in the middle of a battle for eyeballs." "We are not just battling time for other games," he adds. "We're also battling for the time of people watching TV, people watching YouTube, music, videos - games are battling with streamers over eyeballs, because there's only one set of eyeballs. It all ties into the same thing… you have games like ours that have huge playtime. You have games like Candy Crush or Clash Royale, but also games like Destiny that have huge, huge playtimes, and we've seen a lot more of those coming through." All of those games, he goes on, "are battling against everything else. Plus there are more games coming out now than there've ever been before. Literally thousands of games coming out each month. Not everything can survive. So the subscription platforms are part of it, but the whole market is part of it as well." Likewise, he adds, "you have to be realistic about the situation, which is: if there aren't enough hours in the day for the games to be played, then there are games that aren't going to be able to be made. That's the reality, in my opinion, of what people have been going through the last few years… I think people probably realised there's just too many games coming out, they can't all be successful. And the budgets have gone up so much - budgets have gone up exponentially - so you have to sell a lot more than you had to sell five years ago to have a hit game. So it's a perfect storm." That ultimately comes back to Jacobson and the team's five- and ten-year plans - something which might insulate Football Manager as a series more than other games from the "infinite money" concerns raised above. "We've got my COO, we've got the comms team, we've got the finance team, we've got the BI team, and we've got the whole of Sega that we worked with to agree on that long-term plan," Jacobson says. "And then I ruined it all by not releasing FM25."

Title: Artists are losing work, wages, and hope as bosses and clients embrace AI

Time Published: 2025-09-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
After the launch of ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom in Silicon Valley in late 2022, it was mere months before OpenAI turned to selling the software as an automation product for businesses. (It was first called Team, then Enterprise.) And it wasn’t long after that before it became clear that the jobs managers were likeliest to automate successfully weren’t the dull, dirty, and dangerous ones that futurists might have hoped: It was, largely, creative work that companies set their sights on. After all, enterprise clients soon realized that the output of most AI systems was too unreliable and too frequently incorrect to be counted on for jobs that demand accuracy. But creative work was another story. As a result, some of the workers that have been most impacted by clients and bosses embracing AI have been in creative fields like art, graphic design, and illustration. Since the LLMs trained and sold by tech companies have ingested countless illustrations, photos, and works of art (without the artists’ permission), AI products offered by Midjourney, OpenAI, and Google can recreate images and designs tailored to a clients’ needs at rates much cheaper than hiring a human artist. The work will necessarily not be original, and as of now it’s not legal to copyright AI-generated art, but in many contexts, a corporate client will deem it passable—especially for its non-public-facing needs. This is why you’ll hear artists talk about the “good enough” principle. Creative workers aren’t typically worried that AI systems are so good they’ll be rendered obsolete as artists, or that AI-generated work will be better than theirs. Their fear is that clients, managers, and even consumers will deem AI art “good enough” as the companies that produce it push down their wages and corrode their ability to earn a living. (There is a clear parallel to the Luddites here, who were skilled technicians and clothmakers who weren’t worried about technology surpassing their skill, but the way factory owners used it to make cheaper, lower-quality goods that drove down prices.) Sadly, this seems to be exactly what’s been happening, at least according to the available anecdata. I’ve received so many stories from artists about declining work offers, disappearing clients, and gigs drying up altogether, that it’s clear a change is afoot, and that many artists, illustrators, and graphic designers have seen their livelihoods impacted for the worse. And it’s not just wages. Corporate AI products are inflicting an assault on visual arts workers’ sense of identity and self-worth, as well as their material stability. As with translators, the subject of the last installment of AI Killed My Job, there’s a widespread sense that AI companies are undermining a crucial pillar of what makes us human; our capacity to create and share art. Some of these stories, I will warn you, are very hard to read—to the extent that this is a content warning for descriptions of suicidal ideation. All, I think, help us better understand how AI is impacting the arts and the visual arts industry. A sincere thanks to everyone who wrote in and shared their stories. “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing,” as the from SF author Joanna Maciejewska memorably put it, “not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” These stories show what happens when it’s the other way around. A quick note before we proceed: Soliciting, curating, and editing these stories, as well as producing them, is a time-consuming endeavor. I can only do this work thanks to readers who chip in $6 a month, or $60 a year—the cost of a decent cup of coffee, or a coffee table book, respectively. If you find value in it, and you’re able, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription. I would love to expand the scope and reach of this work. Many thanks, and onward. Edited by Mike Pearl. ﻿I work in the field of constructing costumes for live entertainment: theater, film/TV, ballet/opera, touring performers, etc. Budget and scale is all over the map, from low-budget storefront theater in which one person designs and secures costumes for a production, up to a big-budget Broadway spectacular, which can have a dozen people on the design team alone and literally hundreds of makers creating the costumes from designs developed by the design team. I’m seeing this happen typically on the low-budget to midrange end—community theater/high school theater, independent film, etc.: Producers and directors eliminating the position of costume designer in favor of AI image generation. It comes up often in professional forums in the field, someone will share the AI generated costume “designs” and they will be literally impossible to construct for an actual human with materials available in the actual world—gravity-defying materials on pornographically cartoon bodies, etc. -Rachel E. Pollock I remember reading about the new stage of generative AI engines sometime in late 2022 in the NY Times, and seeing Dall-E and Midjourney's outputs and knowing it will mean trouble. Until then AI was making laughable 'art.' Really bad stuff. But all of a sudden the engines had leveled up. I have been working in the comics and publishing industry for over 20 years, but the majority of my income was usually coming from work with advertising agencies. Whenever they needed to present an idea to a client I would come in and help with illustrations, and sometimes storyboards, this was all internal and would never be published, but it was still great to get paid for doing what I love most—drawing. I felt appreciated for my skills and liked working with other people. It was in 2023 that It seemed like overnight all those jobs disappeared. On one of my very last jobs I was asked to make an illustrated version of an AI generated image, after that, radio silence. I had my suspicions that AI was the culprit, but could not know for sure, there was also a general downturn in the advertising industry at the time. Finally I reached out to one of the art directors I work with and he confirmed that the creatives are using AI like crazy, there was no aspect of shame in presenting an AI illustration internally, no one would call you out on it, and it's sure as hell cheaper than using an illustrator. I had to deal with a sudden, very scary decrease in income. Meanwhile it felt like AI slop was mocking me from every corner of the internet, and every big company was promoting their new AI assistant. I was just disgusted with all these corporations jumping on the AI bandwagon not thinking of what the outcomes could be. and additionally, there was the insult of knowing that the engines were trained on working illustrators, including mine! I used my free time to work on a new graphic novel, and eventually leaned into more comics work, which paid (a lot) less, but at least felt more creatively satisfying. The two years following the loss of work were difficult, definitely felt like the rug was taken out from under my feet, and I'm still adjusting to the new landscape, although I feel better about where I am now, I work harder than ever before, for less money. But at least the work will be seen by readers. I'm hoping that in the world of comics the public shame of replacing an artist with AI will hold off the use of the technology, but I'm sure that one day it will become a lot more accepted. I feel like we live in an age where technological changes are happening too rapidly, and are not in any way reined in by the government, and humans can lose their job in the drop of a hat, with no sense of security or help. We are just not built for these fast changes. I'm happy to see people sobering up to the downside of this technology, and hoping the hype would die down soon. -Anonymous I've been out of work for a while now. I made children's book illustrations, stock art, and took various art commissions. Now I have several maxed out credit cards and use a donation bin for food. I haven't had a steady contract in over a year. two weeks ago, when a client who has switched to AI found out about this he gave me $50 out of "a sense of guilt." Basically pity for the fact that Illustrator, as a job, does not exist anymore. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore.The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. I feel cheated, like if I could go back in time and tell the younger me in high school that all the practice, all the love, and all the hope from your parents and friends for your future gets you is carpal tunnel and poverty, I could have gone into a better job field. I'd be an electrician or welder. I have a resume with skills that are appealing to no one, as slop can be generated for free. I sold my colored pencils and markers and illustration tablet on Facebook marketplace for a steal once a previous client who I considered a friend boasted on LinkedIn that AI was the future of cost reduction above an image of a man in a suit who looked like him with six fingers holding a wad of cash. I have applied to over one thousand jobs and I stopped keeping track. My disability didn’t effect making art, but makes me a poor candidate for much else. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore. The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. My friends all post themselves as cartoons online. The person I married had a secret file on their computer labeled "AI pics" they thought I didn't notice. I will wither away eating stale food from the garbage while everyone else is complacent with the slop generator doing what I used to put passion into and finely detail. I don't think it's going to get better. -Anonymous1 I have taught various graphic courses but overwhelmingly Photoshop, the 800 lb. gorilla of the graphics world. I am not a photographer and I do not teach people to take photos, but to manipulate them, also known as Photo Imaging. They are done by manually placing several images into a composite, and then enhancing them by various digital techniques such as layering, blending, masking etc. to arrive at a final result. Most people who take my classes don’t necessarily want to do all that I do, but want to know how to correct or otherwise manipulate photos to create their own projects. I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence and Photoshop’s version, Firefly, my teaching and private tutoring have pretty much dropped dead. There is very little incentive for people to learn these techniques when they can conjure up an image by text prompts. It takes virtually no skill to do this besides the ability to read and write. I have played around with A.I. for personal projects, with varying degrees of success. Some of it is amazing, and some of it is laughable. However, there is no escaping the reality that these models were trained on existing artwork already online. It’s essentially plagiarism on steroids. Also known as theft. Not to mention the obscene energy costs involved. Had this happened to me 20 years ago I would have been devastated. But at this point in my life (I’m 71) it is not as important as it once was. I’ve had some success both in client work and also creating digital art pieces for which I’ve won accolades. I’ve found satisfaction in teaching but now I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. I have been married over 50 years and we have never relied on my income to survive. -Susan Oakes I worked in the video game industry, as a 3D artist. In early 2023, when AI image generation was hitting the mainstream, I was working as a temporary contractor at a large games and technology company. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there.” I have not been able to find any work since then. Our boss was very enthusiastic about AI image generation, and he showed us how he was using AI to generate some of the textures for the game. I realized that if AI image generation didn't exist, then the company would have needed to hire an extra artist to do that work. I could have recommended a dozen colleagues who were looking for work at the time. It felt like AI was directly taking money out of artist's pockets, and allowing the companies to keep it all. When my contract with that company ended, I did an exit interview with my boss. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there." I have not been able to find any work since then. There were several factors as to why there were so many layoffs in games and technology in 2023-2024, but I know that AI has played a role. I miss working as a 3D artist. -Anonymous I am a freelance 3D/2D Generalist. Over the past decade plus, I've had a recurring gig of being hired as a contractor to help create supplemental graphics and B-roll for various documentary-style programs. Everything from infographics about military tanks to 3D animations of prehistoric creatures to recreations of scenes involving historical figures. If you've ever watched any History show, you know the format: footage of the host and experts speaking, then sometimes video clips or photographs, and then typically animated content that illustrates the points the speaker is making. That final category was, until recently, made by people like me. That market has completely dried up. My job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. A couple of years ago, as soon as demos of AI-generated video began to appear, there were almost immediate rumblings that the specific business of creating documentary-style graphics would be disrupted. The logic being that, while the public might reject a feature-length AI-slop theatrical film, the at-home audience for shows about military history or ghosts or aliens might be less-discerning. That theory is now being tested. History Channel is currently airing a season of "Life After People" that heavily features AI-generated visuals, and I'm sure there are more shows in the pipeline being made the same way. We'll see how audiences respond. As much as I would like to say viewers will reject the AI style and demand a return to human-made art, I'm not convinced it will happen. Even if it did, it might soon be too late to turn back. I know that there are studios with expert producers, writers, and showrunners with decades of experience in this exact genre who are closing their doors. That institutional knowledge will be gone. That's probably the bigger point: this trend is not only affecting artists like me, but also the types of companies I contract for. Obviously I lament my own loss of those stable gigs, but my job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. -Anonymous I work as a freelance illustrator (focusing on comics and graphic novels but also doing book covers or whatever else might come my way) and as a "day job" I do pre-press graphic design work for a screen printing and embroidery company in Seattle. Because of our location, we handle large orders (sometimes 10k shirts at a time) for corporate clients—including some of the biggest companies in the world (Microsoft, Amazon, MLB, NHL, etc.) and my job is to create client proofs where I mock up the art on the garment and call out PMS colors as applicable. I also do the color separations to prepare the art file for screen printing. [H]e instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. When AI first came on the scene, I was approached by a potential client that was self-funding a mobile game and wanted to commission me to create in-game art. He asked what my standard rate was and then offered to double it if I allowed him to pay in etherium (which I knew nothing about at that point.) I immediately had some concerns, but I'm a struggling artist so I took the gig anyway and crossed my fingers. He then introduced me to generative AI and encouraged me to use it to create game content quickly. At first I was interested in the possibility of using it to reduce my workload by maybe generating simple elements I get tired of painting—like grasses or leaves—but he instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. After that I resisted and tried to use my own art. He grew frustrated with me pretty quickly and I left the company after less than 2 weeks (I was never paid; he owes/owed me about $1300).` Since then, I have been very outspoken against generative AI and haven't touched it again. I was the moderator for a very large group of children's book illustrators (250k members) and I helped institute and enforce a strict AI ban within the group. While this was mostly a positive thing, there were quite a few occasions where legitimate artists were targeted for harassment over accusations of AI use. Some of them were even driven out of the group, in spite of our interventions and assurances that the person was not using AI. In my own freelancing work, I have now been accused of using AI as well. I like to do fan art from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern [series], and sometimes when I'm looking for work I will post my art and past commissions in fan groups to see if anyone wants to hire me to draw their original characters based on the Pern books. Almost invariably now someone will ask if my art is AI generated. It used to bother me more than it does now, I'm growing a little numb to it. My coworker at my screen printing job (in spite of knowing my negative feelings on the matter because I had cried after I found several dozen pieces of my art in the LAION dataset) chose to plug my art into an AI generator and asked for it to imitate my style—which it did poorly, might I add. It felt extremely violating. Lastly, in my role as a graphic designer, we often now have to deal with clients sending art files in for screen printing that were generated with AI. It's a pain in the ass because these files are often low-resolution and the weird smudgy edges in most AI images don't make for easy color separations. When a human graphic designer sits down to create a design, they typically leave layers in place that can be individually manipulated and that makes my job much easier. AI flattens everything so I have to manually separate out design elements if I want to independently adjust anything. The text is still frequently garbled or unreadable. The fonts don't actually exist so they can't easily be matched. These clients are also almost invariably cheap, and get upset when they're told that it's going to be a $75 per hr art charge to fix the image so it's suitable for screening. Also, and here I don't have any data, just my personal anecdotal experience, but it feels like some of these companies have laid off so much of their in-house graphic design staff that they are increasingly reliant on us as a print service to fix up stuff they'd formerly done for themselves. I get simple graphic design requests every day by people who should have had the resources to handle this themselves but now they're expecting me to pick up the slack for the employees they've let go for the sake of our working relationship and keeping them on as clients. It's become such a drag on our small business that my boss is considering extra fees. (Which, considering the slim margins in the garment industry, is really saying something!) I am convinced Microsoft does not have any in-house graphic designers left at this point. Okay I joke, but man, it's bleak. I have no way of knowing how many gigs I've lost to AI, since it's hard to prove a negative. I'm not significantly less busy than I was before, and my income hasn't really changed for better or worse. There's more stress and fear, greater workloads cleaning up badly-done AI-generated images on behalf of people looking for a quick fix, instead of getting to do my own creative stuff. And it felt deeply and profoundly cruel to have my life's work trained on without my consent, and then put to use creating images like deepfakes or child sexual abuse materials. That one was really hard for me as a mom. I'd rather cut my own heart out than contribute to something like that. There's a part of me that will never forgive the tech industry for what they've taken from me and what they've chosen to do with it. In the early days as the dawning horror set in, I cried about this almost every day. I wondered if I should quit making art. I contemplated suicide. I did nothing to these people, but every day I have to see them gleefully cheer online about the anticipated death of my chosen profession. I had no idea we artists were so hated—I still don't know why. What did my silly little cat drawings do to earn so much contempt? That part is probably one of the hardest consequences of AI to come to terms with. It didn't just try to take my job (or succeed in making my job worse) it exposed a whole lot of people who hate me and everything I am for reasons I can't fathom. They want to exploit me and see me eradicated at the same time. -Melissa I’m a South African illustrator and designer with 20 years of experience, and in my industry, I saw things going pear-shaped even before gen AI hit the scene. One the main places I get jobs from is on Upwork (one of those gig type work platforms), and I’ve noticed a couple of things: A decrease in job offerings for the illustration I typically do (like book covers). I’ve also noticed a lot more job offers to “fix” an AI generated cover. These authors offer less money because of “the work is pretty much done” attitude. Since Upwork added an AI function to help potential employers write their briefs, there’s been a surge in what I’m pretty sure are fake jobs. The job listings all sound very samey obviously because of the format the ai uses, and the employers have no history on the platform of ever having hired anyone and don’t have their phone or bank linked. So I think what might be happening is that some evil person/persons are creating fake accounts and posting fake jobs so that their competitors waste credits applying for these jobs. -Roxane Lapa I got my start on deviantart, moved on to furaffinity and various other websites. I used to take commissions in the furry fandom drawing futa furries with big fat tits and dicks. In the past year or two my commissions have all but dried up, in the time it can take me to do the lineart for an anthropomorphic quokka's foreskin, someone can just go onto one of a dozen websites and knock something of tolerable quality out in no time at all. AI has ruined a once sacred artform. -Anonymous I am the creative team manager for an e-commerce based company. I manage the projects of 2 videographers, 1 CG artist and 3 graphic designers (including myself).As AI has been getting more and more advanced, our boss (one of the owners) keeps pushing us to use AI to make our images stand out amongst competitors. We have a limited budget, so filming or photographing our products in real environments is difficult. And photoshopping them into stock imagery also takes time. Apparently a 1-hour turn around time per image is not quick enough. Our boss has been going to conferences where he hears and sees nothing but praise for AI created images. How quick it is and how "good" the images look like.So of course he's been pushing us to use this technology. I did tell him that it's going to be a learning curve and to be patient. From Midjourney, to the latest update of Chat GPT, and to Adobe's Firefly. We've been cranking out these partial AI images. The funny part is, A LOT of it still has to be photoshopped together. AI is still not smart enough (yet) to produce accurate images. The products we sell are very particular and even if you feed the AI images of said product, it never gets it 100% right.Our boss didn't believe us so he himself tried it and failed miserably. Despite that, he still reminds us that our jobs will be obsolete and that we have to adapt.Even since we started using AI to improve our images, the turnaround time for listing images remains the same. Though I feel like our boss is waiting for the day to fire and replace my team with AI. -Anonymous As an artist, I thought I was going crazy when it seemed everyone was okay (even enthusiastic) with our work being scraped left and right to build image-generation models. I'm a mom and have a mortgage to pay, so the existential threat to my livelihood caused a lot of sleepless nights to say the least. I have been working in 2D animation for the last 10 years. I'm a background artist, which is unfortunately one of the departments most likely to be hit by gen AI replacement in the animation production pipeline. Of course, there's no reality where gen AI could actually do my job properly as it requires a ton of attention to detail. Things need to be drawn at the correct scale across hundreds of scenes. In many cases scenes directly hook up to each other, so details need to stay consistent—not to mention be layered correctly. But these are things that an exec typically glosses over in the name of productivity gains. Plus, there's already a precedent in which AI was used to produce backgrounds for a Netflix anime. Thankfully, I'm very lucky to work at an artist-run studio that currently appears to avoid the use of AI, so I continue to be employed. My peers who were freelance illustrators or concept artists are not so lucky. I'd say about half of the people I've worked alongside this last decade have left the field (not all because of AI, granted, but the state of the North American animation/games industry is a whole thing right now and AI is not helping). The production I am on currently leverages a lot of stock photos from Adobe Stock. We have a rule in place not to use AI, but some images slip through the cracks. These have to be removed from the finished product because of, I assume, the inability to copyright AI-generated images. An incident happened recently where an AI image almost made it to the very end of the pipeline undetected and wound up disrupting several departments who are on tight submission deadlines. We aren't typically paid overtime unless approved by the studio beforehand, so it's likely that unpaid labor (or ghost hours, where you don't tell anyone you worked overtime) went into fixing this mess AI created. I was running research on [Adobe’s] stock marketplace, trying to understand how customers were adopting the new Gen A.I. tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. Internally Adobe was launching their own text-to-image A.I. generator called Firefly but it hadn’t been announced. I was on the betas for Firefly and Generative Fill (GenFill) for Photoshop and ran workshops with designers on the Firefly team. I tested the new tooling internally and gave feedback on Adobe Slack channels and their ethics committee. A.I. generated content started to flood the Adobe Stock website as stock contributors quickly switched from adding and uploading photos to prompting and creating assets with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly and then selling them back on Adobe Stock. Users wanted a better search experience but it was never explicitly clear if they wanted more A.I. slop, although Reddit forums indicated otherwise. During the GenFill beta, I raised concerns about model bias after prompting the model to edit an image of then president Joe Biden across racial categories and having the model return a Black man with cornrows—without taking into account relevant and contextual surrounding information in the image. The ethics committee pointed me to a boilerplate Word doc with their guiding principles and we had a short Microsoft Teams call, but there wasn’t any real concern from their end. After raising additional red flags inside an Adobe Slack channel about Photoshop’s GenFill beta possibly being used to create misinformation at scale the main response I got was a blasé “Photoshop, making misinformation since 1990…” Long story long, the people internally working on these products really don’t care. In another company all hands meeting about text-to-vector capabilities fellow workers shared thoughts and concerns on the impact of AI tooling to the livelihoods of artists, illustrators and other designers in the Teams chat and no one cared. In another meeting when asked about artist’s rights a manager quipped “In the research from AdobeMAX (Adobe’s annual conference) someone said they were willing to sell their ‘artistic style’ for around the price of a car” when gathering data around AI-style mimicry and trust. The Firefly model still struggled to render hands and certain objects with difficulty and an Adobe company wide email sent to all employees encouraged us to sign up for an upcoming photoshoot on a green screen, holding things like trumpets, accordions, rubber chickens and asked employees to make awkward expressions like being surprised with “mouth open” or squinting while putting your finger in your ear in exchange for a free lunch. Some time in 2023 Adobe paid for photographers to document crowds of people during a concert in Seattle and had attendees sign waivers releasing their likeness since Firefly had trouble rendering and distinguishing people in crowds. Shortly thereafter I was told my staff role was being eliminated. They didn’t let me switch teams. They gave me six weeks to find a new job inside the company and six weeks of severance pay. During the six weeks of “offboarding” as they called it I applied to dozens of internal jobs at Frame.io and other teams like Acrobat within the company and it never went anywhere. -Anonymous I just graduated in June from a two-year intensive vocational program in graphic design. It's probably still too early in my job search for me to say that AI "killed my job," but my classmates and I, as well as students from the class just ahead of us, are certainly struggling to find work. Why I wanted to reach out, though, is to share what my experience was as a student studying design in the midst of the peak years of this AI hype. Basically our entire second-year curriculum in one of our five classes, which was previously focused on UX, UI, web design, etc, transitioned to being largely generative AI-focused. I don't think I'm overstating matters to say that no one in my class was happy about this; none of us decided to go (back) to school for design to learn Midjourney or Runway. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? [One instructor] has lived through and had his career significantly impacted by past shifts in the industry (he was a full-time web designer when platforms like Squarespace came along), so my charitable read is that he wants to prepare us for a lifetime of learning new tools to stay employable. I think the faculty in our program are also hearing from alumni and their technical advisory board that AI tools are becoming more important for local companies (we live in a pretty tech-centric city). So while he's sympathetic, I guess, he's still choosing to go all-in on AI, and to push his students to do the same. In our other classes, AI use was varied. Some of our instructors allowed it; a couple still forbid it completely. I came out of school feeling like... I guess I'm grateful to know what's out there, for the sake of my own employability in this really awful job market. I really feel for designers whose school days are a little further behind them. It's not just AI that makes me say this—in fact, even if things like image and video generators find a more permanent place in graphic arts careers, they're changing fast enough that whatever we learned in school is likely to be outdated pretty quickly. If all the angry posts I see on LinkedIn from more senior designers are any indication, there's been a trend in hiring for a while of companies looking for a designer who also does video, animation, UX/UI, and many other things that aren't really graphic design. Our program taught us a lot of those skills, so maybe, if the current economic circumstances improve, our class might be okay. But it makes me worry a lot for our future. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? Even our AI-booster instructor told us over and over again that computers will never replace the need for creative design thinking and empathy. That, he said, is what we should lean into to distinguish ourselves and ensure our employability. But there are only so many positions out there for art directors, and not everyone who studies design wants to do that. Production design gets looked down on as "menial" by some, I think, but it used to be the pipeline into more senior design positions--and if that goes away, how do new designers even get into the field? And what about people who have worked in production their whole lives? -Anonymous I am a freelancer of a few trades, so it can be hard to measure lost work, because I can also wonder if I'm slow because times are slow, or a typical cycle, or AI. I can tell you this: ALL my "lighter" graphic design work—making social media or print ad graphics, designing logos—has totally dried up. I was actually more worried about this when Canva came out, but even then they wanted my eye and my touch on things, so having the tools to do it themselves didn't really deter people from hiring me. I did this kind of work for some local small businesses, organizations, event venues. This was an abrupt change within the past couple years. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" […] are in the bones of the art. My illustration work is mostly picture books, and while my work has remained steady (I do 1-3 a year), the number of inquiries I've gotten from new authors has dropped to nearly zero, when I used to field a few a month and usually book myself out for the next year. Also, through Upwork and other various avenues I find work, I've had quite a few people (presumably authors) reach out to me to "fix" their AI generated art. It does depend on the task at hand but it's a 90% certainty that fixing the art will take nearly as long as just doing it myself. Of course they aren't coming to me with AI generated work because they intended to hire a full-blown illustrator. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" AI makes on art for something like a picture book, which requires consistency of a lot of different elements across at minimum 16 or so pages, are so deep that they are in the bones of the art. It's not airbrushing out a sixth finger; it's making the faux colored pencil look the same across pages, or all the items in a cluttered room be represented consistently from different angles, or make the different characters look like they came from the same universe. It's bad at that stuff and it's not surface level. A lot of time potential clients don't know why the art isn't working and it's because it's these all-encompassing characteristics. -Melissa E. Vandiver The title for this story comes from the heading of the email this author submitted. Hopefully, as the bubble bursts, the quality of these outputs will plateau, and people will realize it was all slop to begin with. It’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with soulless bunch of pixels and even just putting them in the same category. The point of art, no matter the category-even something as simple as corporate illustration, is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can feel the quirks, the struggle and the love in every piece or at the very least the personality of the artist. And that’s what makes art unique and human. No doubt AI art can be beautiful, after all it’s modelled on top of some of the best human art ever produced. But to me, it will always feel like you know when you’re taking a photo of the sunset or the moon with your phone and it never looks right? Those photos never compares to actually standing beneath it and taking the moment in with the sight. Both can impress, sure, but only one is able to make us feel something in our bones. And that’s what AI art will never be able to do for me As a medical transcriptionist, I went through the same story in the early 2000s when speech recognition software became a thing. I went from making good money, to training the speech engines, to being paid a pittance to edit SR-generated text, to leaving the field and having to reinvent myself - at 56. I finally retired because I was making less reviewing medical records full-time as an independent contractor than I would with Social Security, even retiring early. Rapid evolution of technology is more than our society is built to handle. Pursuit of insane profits by releasing iffy tech will destroy us from the bottom up. There are now disclaimers in every medical record to the effect that much of the text of reports is generated by speech engines and ***mistakes should be expected/can occur***. JFC.

Title: Jerome Powell on signs of an AI bubble and an economy leaning too hard on the rich: ‘Unusually large amounts of economic activity’

Time Published: 2025-09-17T22:29:07Z

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. For months, Wall Street commentators have fretted that the artificial intelligence boom looks like a bubble, with capital spending – which some analysts estimate could reach $3 trillion by 2028 – fattening a few mega-cap firms, while lower-income workers suffer from a slack labor market. On Wednesday, they got validation from an unlikely source: the chair of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell said the U.S. is seeing “unusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI buildout,” a rare acknowledgement from the central bank that the surge is not only outsized, but also skewed toward the wealthy. That imbalance extends beyond markets. Roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth comes from consumer spending, yet most households live paycheck to paycheck. That demand picture has taken on a shape that analysts call K-shaped: while many families cut back on essentials, wealthier households continue to spend on travel, tech, and luxury goods—and they continued to do so in August. For now, the inflation recovery depends heavily on this dynamic remaining in fragile stasis. It’s a fix that works well until it doesn’t, if it could be described as working at all.“[Spending] may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s latest policy meeting. “There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that.” That skew has become increasingly obvious in markets. Just seven firms — Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla — now make up more than 30% of the S&P 500’s value. Their relentless AI capex is keeping business investment positive, even as overall job growth has slowed to a crawl. Goldman Sachs estimates AI spending accounted for nearly all of the 7% year-over-year gain in corporate capex this spring. The comments underscore a widening concern at the Fed: that while headline GDP growth is holding above 1.5%, the composition of that growth is uneven, unlike previous booms in housing or manufacturing. Powell pointed to “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities” as struggling to find jobs in today’s cooling labor market, even as affluent households continue to spend freely and companies funnel cash into cutting-edge technologies. The imbalance reflects what Powell described as “a low firing, low hiring environment,” where layoffs remain rare but job creation has slowed to a crawl. That dynamic, combined with the concentration of economic gains in AI and among the wealthy, risks deepening inequality, and complicates the Fed’s attempt to balance its inflation and employment mandates. That disconnect risks widening the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. While affluent households continue to spend freely and tech titans pour billions into data centers and chips, revised jobs data show the economy added just 22,000 positions in August, with unemployment edging up to 4.3%. “Unusually large” AI investment may sustain top-line growth, Powell suggested, but it’s doing little to lift the broad labor market.“The overall job finding rate is very, very low,” he said. “If layoffs begin to rise, there won’t be a lot of hiring going on.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Job seekers: Where are you looking for opportunities right now? There’s been plenty of coverage on the plight of those currently looking for a new job. From the falling hiring rates and increasing unemployment time—the average American now spends more than five months in between jobs, up from four in 2024—to the flood of AI-generated résumés that recruiters receive, applicants are having a tough time. Keeping your search to just one job board isn’t cutting it anymore. Now, OpenAI is tapping into the game. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to launch its own jobs platform next year. The platform “will have knowledgeable, experienced candidates at every level, and opportunities for anyone looking to put their skills to use,” according to a blog post from CEO of Applications Fidji Simo. It will also help small businesses find “AI talent” for specific needs. The tech giant is also getting in on the certifications industry, which made $6.4 billion in revenue last year, according to IBIS world. OpenAI’s options will include certifications from intro-level all the way to advanced AI usage, such as prompt engineering. They’re not the first company to inject AI into the job search process. LinkedIn started incorporating the technology into users’ job searches in 2023. As of May, Premium users can ask LinkedIn’s AI to find personalized jobs through a chat. Companies like Coursera, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and even LinkedIn have long had their own “AI fluency” or “Intro to AI” certifications for workers looking for that extra badge. Still, for those struggling to land their next job, Forbes contributors have a few suggestions: For one, look at niche job boards, writes Bryan Robinson. It’s easy for people to spam LinkedIn postings with résumés and applications for jobs they’re not quite qualified for, causing some qualified candidates to get buried. By using lesser-known job boards like Wellfound, Otta or FlexJobs, your odds of getting a response could increase. And once you’ve scheduled an interview, you can use AI as your personal coach, suggests contributor Justin Sablich. Custom interview prompts, like using the STAR—situation, task, action, result—method or asking the model to act as an adversarial interviewer can help you go deeper with each question. But always be wary of the specific information you give the chatbot. Have any other tips on finding your perfect job in this new market, or questions over your own search? My inbox is always open.

But why was the revision so high? New businesses, reports Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin, as well as an actual count of jobs added versus the initial survey estimate. Stanford holds the best MBA program this year, according to LinkedIn’s annual ranking of postgraduate programs. Cofounder, CEO and product manager are the most common titles to come out of the school. Real estate giant Brookfield declared the return-to-office debate “over” in its latest investor day presentation. The news comes as Microsoft employees will be required to be in the office three days a week starting in 2026. Though this caused an online stir, the slight increase from 2.5 days fell in line with the majority of Fortune 100 companies, according to FlexIndex. Lawyers representing powerful names like Sean Diddy Combs and Elon Musk are some of the Top Lawyers in America this year, according to Forbes’ annual roll call of the country’s high-caliber counsel. Unlike during his first term, President Donald Trump has not yet declared the start of Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 through October 15) as of Tuesday morning. Some celebrations have been slimmed down or even canceled this year amid fears over immigration raids and efforts to combat diversity, equity and inclusion.

Title: Over 166,000 tech jobs cut in 2025 so far

For most of Big Tech, 2025 has been a solid year financially — Intel being the notable exception. But for employees, job security feels increasingly fragile. According to an analysis by RationalFX, a total of 166,387 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2025. The report pulls information from U.S. WARN notices, job board TrueUp, TechCrunch, and the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. Intel tops the list. The struggling chipmaker plans to cut around 34,000 jobs this year as it tries to streamline operations and reset its strategy. Microsoft isn’t far behind. The Redmond-based giant has already gone through multiple rounds of layoffs: roughly 6,000 roles in April and another 9,000 in July, RationalFX foresees a total of at least 19,215 positions in 2025 eliminated in the name of efficiency. India’s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ranks third, with an estimated 12,000 employees let go this year, largely as part of cost-cutting measures and the rollout of AI-driven automation. Cuts haven’t stopped there. Almost every major player has made reductions: IBM is phasing out about 9,000 HR roles, shifting many of those responsibilities to AI. STMicroelectronics, the European chipmaker, is cutting 5,000 jobs. Salesforce shed 1,000 positions in February and another 4,000 in September. Meta has already let go of 3,720 staff this year, continuing a pattern from previous years. Amazon eliminated over 3,350 jobs, including through the closure of all its Canadian warehouses. Oracle laid off 3,000 workers in just the past two months. Even Elon Musk’s xAI joined the trend, dismissing 500 employees who had worked on training its chatbot Grok. AI itself is emerging as a major factor. Analysts estimate that roughly 37,702 of the layoffs this year were directly tied to automation and the adoption of AI tools that replaced human tasks outright. Looking ahead, RationalFX forecasts that total tech layoffs could climb to 235,000 by the end of 2025. RationalFX

Tech Layoffs in 2025 Already Top 166,000 Tech companies are facing another wave of massive layoffs, with over 166,000 jobs lost so far in 2025 and projections nearing 235,000. Industry giants like Intel and Microsoft lead the cuts, with AI increasingly replacing human roles in customer service and operations. When COVID-19 struck, many people lost their jobs. People stopped going out as much, and a number of businesses had to shut their doors for good. However, the tech space saw a boom. More people stayed home to work, which meant there was an increase in demand for digital products and services, leading to a hiring frenzy. This all came to a head once the pandemic passed. Now, it looks like layoffs at tech companies are happening again. According to a report from RationalFX, the tech companies are going through massive layoffs in 2025. The report claims that there have been about 166,000 layoffs globally in 2025 so far, and it is estimated to reach as many as 235,000 by the end of the year. This means on average, there are 645 jobs being lost a day since January 2025. The report also reveals which companies have been laying off the most workers. At the top of the list is Intel, with an estimated 33,900 layoffs. This doesn’t come as a surprise. Intel has been struggling as of late, no thanks in part to the rise of AI which has led to an increase in demand for chips from companies like NVIDIA. Intel has also been a bit slow on the mobile front, allowing TSMC and Qualcomm to dominate the scene. Plus, the controversies surrounding some of its CPUs in recent years haven’t done them any favors. Microsoft comes in second place at 19,215 layoffs. We’re also seeing around 9,000 layoffs at IBM, 5,000 at Salesforce, 3,720 at Meta, and 3,350 at Amazon. What’s worrying is that some of these layoffs might not necessarily have to do with companies performing badly. But rather, some of these companies have found that replacing human workers with AI might actually be better financially. The report revealed that companies such as Salesforce slashed its customer support workforce by about half. This is because AI agents were more than capable of doing those jobs. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, also went through similar layoffs, thanks (or no thanks) to AI. IBM’s layoffs are also in part due to AI, where the company is looking to cut costs and streamline its operations. It is true that AI has the potential to take some of our jobs. Things like customer service makes sense. If AI can answer simple questions that customers have quickly and efficiently, why hire a human that might get it wrong? It is worrying, but that seems to be the direction we’re heading towards. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you are a long-term stockholder in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against iRobot on July 7, 2025 with a Class Period from January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of iRobot have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

What it takes to rebuild confidence, culture, and competitive edge. In the winter of 2023, Lyft was facing declining market share and financial pressures. Enter new CEO David Risher, who took the helm amid low morale and limited resources. His challenge: reignite innovation, refocus the culture, and find new ways to stand out in an industry dominated by Uber. Harvard Business School professor Ranjay Gulati joins host Brian Kenny to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” They explore how Risher led during a strategic crossroads, making bold decisions, putting the customer front and center, and shaking loose old habits. Gulati also shares insights from his new book, How to Be Bold, illustrating how courage becomes a competitive advantage in times of uncertainty. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we delve deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s pretty rare for an industry to go from zero to Mach speed in just a few years, but that’s exactly how it’s gone for rideshare services. Since the first peer-to-peer rideshare service launched in 2012, well over a billion people have climbed aboard. Today we’ll dive deep into this phenomenon with a case about Lyft, long the challenger in the ridesharing industry. They faced a choice: double down on product innovation, reinvest in a neglected brand, or simply shore up operations after years of crisis. With a new leader at the wheel, the firm was at a crossroad that called for bold, decisive leadership. Today we’ll unpack the case, discuss how boldness shapes corporate strategy and leadership, and explore what it takes to turn courage into a competitive advantage. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Ranjay Gulati to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Ranjay Gulati’s work explores leadership and strategic challenges for building high-growth organizations in turbulent markets. His new book, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage explores how individuals and organizations can cultivate courage, reframe fear, and act boldly in the face of uncertainty. In many ways, Lyft’s story provides a rich backdrop to test these ideas in action. And he’s also a fellow podcaster. Ranjay, welcome. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. Great to be here. BRIAN KENNY: You’re on the other side of the mic today. So, Ranjay hosts a show called Deep Purpose. You can find that on Apple or Spotify or wherever you listen, and it’s good to have you back on the show. It’s been too long. RANJAY GULATI: I know, Brian, it was great fun last time. I’m delighted to be back. BRIAN KENNY: This is a great case. I mean, we’ve all climbed into the back of a Lyft or an Uber, and those are the two major players, but by no means the only players in this space. So, the case actually comes in a little bit into their growth period where they’re facing some real significant challenges, and our protagonist is taking the helm there, and we’ll talk about all of that. So why don’t we just dive right in. I’m going to ask you to tell us what drew you to write about Lyft. Why did you think this would be a good case for the classroom, and what’s your cold call when you start the discussion? RANJAY GULATI: So, it’s interesting, when you write a case, you may start with one thing, and you may end up completely somewhere else. So, this is one of those stories where I started with a hypothesis about what the case was going to be about. It was really another illustration of a company that had a purpose as a founding principle and how they were trying to live by it. And the purpose was not to build a rideshare business. The purpose was to connect communities in places like Los Angeles, where the two founders were living. And so the idea was that a lot of people who don’t have access to a vehicle or parking or whatever are unable to connect, and it feels a fragmented, alienated life over there. So, this would be a way to bring people closer together. So, I was intrigued by how that kind of kernel of an idea became the basis of their strategy of how they were going to grow their business, about who they wanted to be. But then as I learned more, fast forward, what you discover is that for a variety of reasons, Uber comes into the picture, takes off, dominates, and suddenly now you are a one-third, two-third duopoly. Now, they’ve tried to differentiate and create some differentiation with their drivers and things like that, but even that is going away fast because the riders overlap across Uber and Lyft, so they’re not unique drivers anymore. Customers, you say, okay, I’m going to create stickiness for customers. Everybody has Uber and Lyft on their phone. They’re shopping across and choosing whoever’s the lowest price. Talk about commodity hell. So now what do you do? So, suddenly the case evolved from a study about just purpose to one about competing in commoditizing duopoly markets where the other competitor is bigger than you, has a more diverse revenue stream, can choose to make this a loss-leader. Now, how do you compete in this market? But then they became a third thing into the picture, which was now you have a new CEO. By the way, happens to be one of our alums, and he’s got to figure out, the founders are stepping away. Now you have this awkward transition where when founders set a step aside, professional management comes in and they got to figure out what do you do. BRIAN KENNY: What’s your cold call to start that discussion? RANJAY GULATI: I jump right into the case because I’ve had David Risher in class when I teach the case. So, I start by saying, “You’re David Risher. You’ve come into this business. What is your plan? What are you going to do in the first hundred days? What are you going to do in the first 300 days?” BRIAN KENNY: Wow. RANJAY GULATI: “And I want both plans nailed down, now.” BRIAN KENNY: That’s a brutal cold call. I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of that. So, David is the HBS alum that you mentioned. He’s the protagonist in the case. He’s the one who stepped in to this leadership role in 2023. How would you characterize some of the dilemmas that he was facing? What was he up against? RANJAY GULATI: He was up against pretty significant headwinds because they had come through a particularly brutal COVID because they entirely depend on rideshare, which essentially came to a grinding halt and took a long time to recover back. Meanwhile, Uber had Uber Eats, which was actually a dramatic growth business in COVID. So, here you have a competitor who’s really gained in the previous period, and you are coming from a place of weakness, from a place where you don’t have reserves to go and invest in something big. And so limited resources, layoffs, morale. So, you’re coming through the shadow of darkness over here, while those guys have just rode the wave through, and now you’ve got to find a way. And commoditization has really taken off, because drivers, you have two customers, right? The drivers who are now agnostic between Lyft and Uber, not always the case before. BRIAN KENNY: So, David Risher comes into a culture that already exists. The founders of Lyft had a pretty specific vision for what they wanted to do, and any leader stepping into that role is going to face the challenge of the legacy but also trying to drive the culture forward. What were some of the things that David tried to do? RANJAY GULATI: One of the first things David had to do was overcome internal inertia. And I think somehow sometimes organizations that have a great idea and execute on the idea; they were more successful beyond their wildest of dreams. Even though Uber was even bigger, and Uber has gone global and done all these things, Lyft was very successful. And what does success do to some? Not all, is it makes them fall into what I loosely call the success trap. And the success trap is now you become so fearful of losing what you have, you stop trying to win. And when you do that, you are caught in a vicious cycle of inability to try and experiment, learn, fail, grow. And so, you’re caught in a market that is stagnating, homogenizing, and you are unable to innovate your way into something new. David’s opening letter, what he said about himself, his self-introduction, is also very important because that gives you a kernel of where he’s trying to go. His first point, he says, “Listen, I’ve worked in three organizations. I worked at Microsoft, Amazon, and at this nonprofit.” And he says, “The three things I’ve learned is at Microsoft, I learned about the power of innovation. Innovation is what allows you to be competitive in the marketplace.” He said, “From Amazon, I learned the importance of customer obsession, that you can’t just be customer-centric, you got to be obsessed. It’s an emotional thing, not just a rational thing.” And he said, “From my nonprofit days, I learned the power and importance of frugality, doing more with less. How do you get things done with limited resources?” So, he was going to bring these three perspectives into Lyft. BRIAN KENNY: What were some of the things that came out of that? What were some of the initiatives that he really focused on early on? RANJAY GULATI: So, one of the initiatives that actually was on the cards, they had already debated and discussed it. It wasn’t even David’s original thought, but they had set it aside for whatever reason was this idea of matching female passengers to female drivers. And this was going to be mutually beneficial because many female passengers prefer a female driver. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes sense. RANJAY GULATI: Given all the, in fact, recent tragic stories we’ve been hearing about attacks on passengers. So that was one. But even for the drivers, turned out that many female drivers would not drive rideshare, and they would instead do food delivery, even though you earn less in food delivery than in rideshare. But they felt it was less safe. BRIAN KENNY: I see. RANJAY GULATI: So, they were going to attract these drivers who were doing food share, food deliveries into rideshare saying, we will guarantee only female passengers. It was an idea they already had but for some reason hadn’t executed it. It reminded me of Anne Mulcahy story. Anne Mulcahy was the former CEO of Xerox, which legendarily owned Xerox, PARC and had all these innovations that Apple ran off with, which was the graphical user interface on the mouse. And she said in my class one time, “We didn’t launch products. They escaped from us.” And I don’t know why in some organizations you see that where the ideas may be there, they percolate around, people talk about them, they debate them, then the naysayers kick in, and somehow they get shelved. BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. But it takes some bold leadership to actually revive that and push it through in an existing culture. How was David able to size up what he needed to do and move people in the same direction? Did he face opposition? RANJAY GULATI: In class, he’s talked about that. Yes, he did. But at least to jumpstart the process, leaders need to own it: OK, this is on me. This one’s on me, not on you. I’m not going to blame anybody else. This one’s on me. I own it. And that encourages others to then take ownership. And I think this willingness to step, you’re not going to become an autocrat and drive it constantly top down only. Eventually you’re going to build that confidence. I think people sometimes lose confidence. And then you need to boost up that confidence. And once you get them going, you’re then able to see the process unfold. And if you fast forward and see what Lyft has done in the last year and a half, you’ll see the positive results, the expansion into Europe, the now doing preferred driver choices, there’s a number of new things suddenly coming out of this company that actually was stagnating. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk about your new book because when I invited you to come on the show, I said, Is there a case that you think will help us to bring the ideas of your book to the surface? And you immediately landed on the Lyft case. Why does this case do a good job representing some of the big themes in your book? And maybe you can describe some of those themes to us. RANJAY GULATI: So, the book is called, How to Be Bold: The Science of Everyday Courage. The book is now about the individual level, two-thirds of the book about individual courage. And the last third is about organizational courage. But when I first began writing this book, it was about organizational courage. It was all about, How do you create courage? Now, when you think about the word “courage,” what is courage? Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is taking action in the face of fear. So, let’s get that out of the way. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I like that. RANJAY GULATI: The second thing is now if it’s about action in the face of fear, fear is a primal human emotion that is hardwired in the reptilian brain. It’s a survival emotion: Get out of here, save yourself. Now the question is, what activates that? It turns out there’s great research showing that what activates fear is the situational context of uncertainty. When we encounter uncertainty, it instantly activates fear. Now, let me go back, unpeel the onion one more. What is uncertainty? There was a very famous essay by Frank Knight, the economist, on the distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk is where you know the distribution of outcomes and you can put some probabilities on those outcomes. Uncertainty is, I don’t know. And if you look at present day and time, we are in an era of unprecedented uncertainty. In fact, in a recent article, somebody analyzed earnings calls by CEOs and found that in the last quarter, CEOs mentioned the word “uncertainty” three times as often as they did in the previous quarter. So, the word is out there; we all feeling it. When we experience uncertainty, the natural normal human response is one of fear. Now, the question then is, do we let fear take over? Because fear left to its own devices hijacks the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. And the typical response is one of freeze or flight. Now, if you look at Lyft back then, I didn’t interview them back then, so I don’t know what it was exactly like, but my hypothesis is that it had a freeze response. They were stuck and unable to do much about it. You’re in a market that is rapidly commoditizing. You have a competitor who is much bigger than you, who has diversified their income streams, and so is not totally reliant on this one business, which is the US ridesharing business. What are you going to do? So, to understand this strategic lock or freeze, you got to really understand organizations too have collective emotion, and fear becomes a paralyzing emotion unless you’re willing to face it. BRIAN KENNY: So, how does a leader go in and get people to have collective courage? You talk about collective courage in the case. It comes up in the book, I’m sure. How do you stoke that within an organization? RANJAY GULATI: So, let me give you an example from sports. One of the guests I had in my class many years ago now was Sir Alex Ferguson, the coach of Manchester United, the former legendary coach of Manchester United, for those who don’t know who he is. And one of the things he comments he made in class was that one of the hardest things he has to do as a coach is to take a winning team and make them come back and want to win again. So, somebody said, what do you mean? Are they lazy and complacent now they’ve won a championship? Because he won several. And that’s why in all sports, basketball, football, it’s very hard to see back-to-back championship. And he said, no, you know what happens is instead of playing to win, they start to play not to lose. They’re so fearful of losing. In sports terms, they’ll have the ball possession, but they’ll hold it in their half. They’ll defend more than play offense. And so you go into this defensive posture. So how do you unlock the organization to play offense, to look for opportunities for growth, to take calculated bets, to even walk into uncertainty because it is scary to do things that might not work, right? We want to de-risk it. We teach that stuff. Risk mitigation, risk management, we’re all about risk. Most of business is about risk. BRIAN KENNY: But back to your point about uncertainty, risk brings uncertainty. RANJAY GULATI: But they are separate ideas also. They’re adjacent, but separate ideas. How do we as leaders create the capacity in an organization to face uncertainty, to tackle the fear that is a natural correlate of that uncertainty and put the organization on a playing to win posture? That’s the leader’s challenge. How do you get them thinking upbeat? I’ll give you another example. I’m just finishing a case right now on a totally different company. It’s called Boston Scientific. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: Boston Scientific, in 2010, 11-odd, had done the second worst acquisition ever. They had acquired after AOL, Time Warner. Their acquisition of Guidant was the second worst acquisition, a $27 billion company. They had acquired Guidant for $28 billion. And the two together in a matter of a few years would be worth $4 or $5 billion. Massive destruction of value. So, in comes another CEO, and what is his tagline when he takes over? Winning spirit. Got to start to win again. And once you start to win again, winning is addictive. People want to win. People want to be on a winning team. You just got to give them a taste for what winning is. How do you jump start that? Yes, you need a brilliant strategy. Yes, you need to focus. Yes, you need to think about adjacencies for growth. Yes, you need to be customer obsessed. Yes, you got to figure out what are innovative ways to brand yourself in the market. But there’s an undercurrent beneath all that, which is this winning spirit. How do you get that going? BRIAN KENNY: And you mentioned that Lyft has seen some wins over the last few years. So, winning begets more winning, right? Winning gives you confidence. It makes you feel like you can do it. If you look at David Risher and what he did, are there examples in your book that you can point to that illustrate some of the things that David was able to do, examples of courage or infusing this winning spirit? RANJAY GULATI: So, you mentioned the word “confidence,” and there’s a very famous Stanford psychologist named Albert Bandura who studied something, an adjacent idea called self-efficacy, which relates to confidence. And it turns out that this idea of efficacy and confidence comes in two flavors. One is domain specific. We know our industry, we know our business, we know what we need to do. Now let’s just go do it, right? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: And David saw plenty of that in spades, I’m sure. But beneath that is another generalized form of self-efficacy. It’s a can-do mindset. No matter what comes our way, no matter what curve balls come our way, no matter how many setbacks we have, we got it. We can do it. And that can-do mindset, which is this generalized form of self-efficacy, which is, if you remember Apollo 13, Eugene Kranz tells his team, they have no textbook for this. There’s no manuals for the situation. Oxygen tanks have blown up. And now you have your command module, the LEM, the lunar entry module floating towards the moon. You’re going to use it as a life raft and slingshot their way back to earth. No one even simulated that idea. What does he say in his first meeting? Failure is not an option. Because people are like, oh my God, can’t do it, impossible, hopeless. So, how do you as a leader imbue in your team? Failure is not an option. We’ll have setbacks. We’ll make mistakes. BRIAN KENNY: But let me ask you this. When you say failure is not an option, one of the things we’ve talked about many times on Cold Call with different cases is that you have to allow for failure. You have to create a culture where failure is acceptable so that people are willing to take a chance to innovate in some way. RANJAY GULATI: Absolutely. Great observation. And so, you’re right, idea here is ultimate failure is not an option. BRIAN KENNY: Got it. RANJAY GULATI: But along the way, and you’re right, as we know about making it safe to fail and learning from that failure is critical to the journey of courage. And what is interesting about this, I’ll give you a nuanced idea that I also talk about in the book, is if you look at some of these leaders, including David Risher, I would imagine, how do you not only make it safe to fail, but how do you also deal with success? Because success itself can be complacency inducing. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: So, I think that is the challenge David is going to have now, now that they have some wins under their belt. That’s why you have people who fade away as athletes, just a taste of success and they’re like, OK, I’m done. And you know when I learned that was actually, I wrote a case and I talk about him in the book is Nick Saban, who’s the legendary coach of the University of Alabama football team. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: For those who don’t know him, this guy was unprecedented in terms of his record, everything else. And he has this model he called the process. It’s actually very Eastern spiritual in some ways. He wouldn’t say that. But because the idea is focused on the process, not on the outcome. And he learned that when he was coach at Michigan State and he was about to play Ohio State, which was much better team than theirs. And he went up and met a psychologist in the psych department and said, “I want to know how can I coach my team?” And the gentleman told him, he said, “Listen, just make them focus on each play, not on the score.” At halftime, they were way behind. At halftime, he called the team and said, “Don’t forget what I said to you. Don’t look at the score.” Miraculous turnaround, came and beat Ohio State. So that stayed with him. Losing and winning can confuse and distract you. So, at one level, you are intensely focused on winning, at another, you’re not letting it cloud your thinking. And I’ll share a small other example is Scottie Scheffler, golfer, you would know. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: He was paired up with Tiger Woods at the Masters. On the 12th hole, which is the par three, Tiger hit a 10. He had two balls in the water. It’s one of the lowest scores ever on that hole. He was immediately out of contention of the tournament, and Scheffler was shocked. But the next five holes, Tiger birdied them. It was like nothing had ever happened. Nothing had happened. So how do you face up to failure? How do you face up to fear? I think athletics, sports, there’s a lot of metaphor and real visual stories about that. BRIAN KENNY: Right, of course. RANJAY GULATI: I think for David coming into the job, I think before you get to strategy, he had this one idea. He put it out there and said, jumpstart guys, we can do it. Build up some confidence, self-confidence. We can do it. I think the hardest thing was to help them come out of this malaise where they were just lost. But having a one-off idea is not going to do it. Then you’ve got to build a strategy. So, for him, the next thing or piece of the puzzle was, what’s going to be our strategy? Everyone wants to have clear direction. Then how do you build conviction around that direction? At the same time, you’re doing all this you’re trying to jumpstart and revive your culture to be more performance and results and outcome focused. While you’re doing this with your, you’re trying to also focus on your brand and think about customers. How do customers experience you? A lot of times companies, his idea of customer obsession is also an important piece of the puzzle to think about. To me, what’s surprising from an earlier era of research I had done on customer-centric organizations, it’s fascinating how quickly companies, organizations, forget about their customer. Customers become an abstraction, a data point, a number, a market segment. You’re not thinking tangibly about customers. And in the case of a two-sided marketplace, which is what Lyft is, their customers are both the drivers and the passengers, and they don’t both always want the same thing. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: So how do you really build a customer obsession? So, your strategy, your culture, your actions, your winning is all connected to this thought process of customer obsession. So, I mentioned to you three things that David said he brought to the table. First was innovation, got to get the innovation engine going with a winning spirit. Second was customer obsession. Start thinking about our customers, both sides of them. And then the third one was frugality. In a market that is getting commoditized fast, and you don’t have scale advantage, which is what Uber has over them, you got to find a way to be frugal. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: Organizations struggle to subtract. And I think his frugality thinking is a way to understand that where should Lyft subtract so that they can add also. So, you’re playing addition, subtraction. How do you undertake both simultaneously? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I would imagine the overarching situation that any leader faces stepping into that kind of a role is how hard do I push? How do I balance all the things we’re trying to do so that the organization can withstand what we’re doing? RANJAY GULATI: Pacing change is another, you’ve now- BRIAN KENNY: You could write a whole book about that. RANJAY GULATI: Yeah, that’s a whole different topic, but I think it’s such a critical one. So, I think it’s really important to keep in mind that pacing change is the other piece of the puzzle. Building capacity to enact those changes. You can’t push it too fast, but you can’t push it too slow. So how do you pace that change coming in becomes very, very important. You need to build momentum, and this positive momentum becomes another key part of the puzzle. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Ranjay, this has been a great, you’ve given me a lot to think about, great conversation as I knew it would be. I’ve got one question for you before we end our conversation, which is simply, if you’d like our listeners to remember one thing about the Lyft case and about David Risher, what would it be? RANJAY GULATI: Courage is a source of competitive advantage. It is going to be the currency in times of uncertainty, because courage allows you to lean into that uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. It allows us to become comfortable with uncertainty. It allows us to, as you’ve heard many times from me in our conversation before, it’s okay with being scared.

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google’s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here – it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today’s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it’s not a problem that’s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. The scheme, dubbed “SlopAds,” relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN’s technical report, with the “Slop” moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to “cashout” domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. HUMAN described SlopAds’ use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, “The exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.” As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android’s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. “HUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,” added Kaye. HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack — from attribution to steganography — to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace. ‘Quite frankly, ignorant’: Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale rebukes The Trade Desk’s SSP ‘reseller’ tag The Trade Desk’s reclassification of all supply-side platforms as “resellers” faces pushback from major players like Index Exchange, who call it an oversimplification. This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk’s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk’s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon’s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon’s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal. The move helps Netflix ease buying and boost performance, as Amazon positions itself as the central hub of streaming’s growing ad economy. “This is actually going to be a problem for second-tier demand-side platforms. As ‘open web’ declines, you need to get in with the ‘hedged gardens.’” – An anonymous source reacts to news that “Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy.” A development that had a calamitous impact on The Trade Desk’s stock price. What’s next for Streamr.ai now that it’s been acquired by Magnite? Magnite announced it had acquired Streamr.ai, which specializes in developing AI-generated assets for small businesses to use in their CTV campaigns. Magnite CPO Adam Soroca explains more to AdExchanger. Scope3 lays off staff as part of shift toward agentic advertising Adweek discusses layoffs at the startup led by Brian O’Kelley. While the number of layoffs wasn’t confirmed in the piece, sources told Digiday the number was close to 20%, with the cuts impacting multiple departments, including former senior European leadership. With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google’s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side – the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google’s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer’s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google’s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema’s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors. Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience. The deal comes a week after Amazon announced a similar deal with Netflix, causing the stock price of rival DSP The Trade Desk to falter. The platform is rolling out broadly to both agencies and small- and mid-sized businesses that are looking to control more of their media investment destiny.
