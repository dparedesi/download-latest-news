It's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. Managers' average number of reports — their "span of control" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. Are you a manager with 25 or more direct reports, or have been asked to take on more reports in the "Great Flattening?" Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.

In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. "We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development." What's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. "When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached," Harter said. "We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better." Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. Gallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status," Harter said. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."

The Menlo Park-based company announced the layoffs Tuesday morning in an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth first seen by Bloomberg. Earlier reporting from the paper cites estimates that Reality Labs employs about 15,000 workers, making the cuts roughly 10% of the division's workforce. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton wrote in a statement to state press outlet SFGate. The move was a “part of that effort,” and Meta plans to “reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” Clayton added. Meta’s cuts arrive as the first major tech layoff of 2026, after large workforce reductions tapered off late last year. In November 2022, Meta cut about 11,000 employees in one of the largest layoffs in its history, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg simultaneously reaffirmed the company’s long-term commitment to the metaverse. The move exposed early tension between Reality Labs’ mounting losses and investor pressure for efficiency, even as Meta insisted the strategy remained intact. By the end of the same year, Meta’s metaverse push appeared to struggle due to weak user adoption, unclear consumer demand, and the growing financial drag of Reality Labs. As capital tightened and interest rates rose, the scale of the bet became harder to justify, setting the stage for the company’s current shift away from its previously heavy metaverse investment. Still, the roughly 1,000 roles being eliminated in Reality Labs represent a small fraction of the roughly 154,000 technology job losses recorded across 2025, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry. This, coupled with over-hiring over the last decade, created a wave of job loss in the industry,” the research firm wrote. The tech sector led all private industries in layoffs last year, with job cuts rising 15% from 2024. Industry data compiled by Layoffs.fyi show that tech layoffs fell sharply into late 2025, dropping from 18,510 in October to 8,932 in November and to around 300 in December, as large, headline-scale workforce reductions tapered off heading into year-end. Among its FAANG peers, Meta’s move appears modest in scale. Amazon accounted for the largest workforce reductions within the group over the past year, cutting tens of thousands of roles across retail, devices, and AWS through multiple rounds, per layoff data sourced from public reports. Google and Microsoft implemented smaller but recurring layoffs, generally in the low thousands per round, tied to cost controls and AI-driven restructuring, while continuing to hire selectively in priority areas. Apple largely avoided mass layoffs, relying instead on attrition and slower hiring, while Netflix made limited cuts, typically numbering in the hundreds, as it adjusted operations following changes to its password-sharing model. Records on the California Employment Development Department do not yet show that a worker adjustment and retraining notice (WARN) attributed to Meta has been filed as of Wednesday morning, per Decrypt's review. The EDD “has not received any WARN notices from Meta,” a spokesperson told Decrypt after confirming with their WARN unit.

Title: What Did Workers Have to Say in 2025?

Michigan’s Labor Legacy sculpture (detail), Hart Plaza, Detroit. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair. Despite experiencing the harm of corporate greed and our collapsing social safety net firsthand, workers remain underrepresented in mainstream media. Here at Inequality.org we do our best to counteract that blind spot by publishing pieces with worker voices front and center. Not only do we give workers a platform to voice their perspectives, but we also help disseminate their opinions to newspapers and other media across America through our OtherWords editorial service. Below is a selection of the worker perspectives we published in 2025. If you’re also a worker interested in sharing your thoughts, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us at inequality@ips-dc.org. Jaz Brisack’s 2025 book “Get on the Job and Organize” traces the labor organizer’s experience from Nissan plants in the South to forming part of the nucleus taking on Starbucks to fighting for a union at Tesla. Inequality.org managing editor Chris Mills Rodrigo spoke with Brisack to discuss key takeaways from those hugely important campaigns and the path forward for the labor movement. The anti-union playbook is well rehearsed at this point: sow uncertainty among workers with propaganda and promises that employers will listen, as long as a union doesn’t get in the way. But even if workers successfully win an election, companies have a trump card in their back pockets: delay a first contract as long as possible. Registered nurses Sarah Johnson and Jason Fratangelo have experienced that tactic firsthand. Since winning an election at Michigan’s Corewell Health East in 2024, the company has used every excuse in the book to delay contract negotiations. That’s why Johnson and Fratangelo wrote a piece supporting the Faster Labor Contracts Act, which would require employers to come to the bargaining table after just 20 days. Speaking of delaying contract bargaining, that’s just what Amazon has done since workers at the company’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island shocked the country by voting to unionize in 2021. Despite the company’s intransigence, the union at the warehouse — now affiliated with the Teamsters — has been giving a critical voice to workers. When the bosses refused to do anything about a sewage leak at the facility last August, Yackisha Nebot Lopez and other workers successfully organized to demand to be sent home with pay. Assaults on worker rights came from all sides in 2025. Fran Marion, a fast food worker and organizer, detailed how a plan from Missouri lawmakers to redistrict the state would suppress working-class participation in elections and facilitate the roll-back of hard-fought labor wins. “We were already living in modern-day economic slavery,” Marion wrote. “Now they’re trying to put us in political slavery too. But we won’t let them.” When Flequer Vera was thinking about starting a business, he was worried about replicating the same economic system that he’d struggled through as a migrant worker years earlier. Inspired by a trip to Spain’s Basque Country, Vera opted for a cooperative model. The company he helped found, Sustainergy, has helped retrofit thousands of homes in the Cincinnati area to be more energy efficient. But the primary success of Sustainergy for Vera has been the family-sustaining jobs that the work has supported. Janeé Roberts was first introduced to working at Amazon via her mother, who operated a forklift at the company’s MEM6 warehouse in Mississippi. When Roberts’ mom had an aneurysm on the job, Amazon did nothing to support her recovery. Now Janeé is an organizer with the union at Amazon’s DCK6 location in San Francisco fighting for every other worker who has suffered on the job with little to no support from one of the world’s richest companies. Federal workers were the canary in the coal mine for the second Trump administration’s full frontal assault on labor rights. Before DOGE eliminated her job, Sabrina Valenti was working on coastal restoration at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to protect communities from hurricanes up until the beginning of 2025. With mass layoffs at her organization and spending cuts across the board, Valenti warns that future hurricane seasons could be even more threatening. Another federal worker who shared a personal story through Inequality.org this year was Paul Osadebe, an attorney at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Osadebe pleaded with his fellow federal workers to stay on the job as long as they could because of the critical services they provide to Americans. Later in the year, Osadebe was fired after blowing the whistle on Trump political appointees at HUD who had made it nearly impossible to effectively enforce the Fair Housing Act. Even after the infamous Wells Fargo “fake accounts” scandal of 2016, Kieran Cuadras continued to observe recklessness aimed at squeezing the bank’s employees and consumers to pump up executive paychecks. In this op-ed, the former Wells Fargo internal misconduct investigator calls for taxes on excessive CEO compensation to encourage more equitable corporate practices. Our nation’s leaders, says Cuadras, need to “do something about a CEO pay system that rewards executives with obscenely large paychecks for practices that harm workers and the broader economy.” Organizing Amazon, now America’s second-largest private employer, has been a primary goal of the labor movement. Reverend Ryan Brown was a key figure in an independent campaign to organize a warehouse in North Carolina. Before their union vote, Brown wrote for Inequality.org about the massive anti-union and surveillance campaign that Amazon was waging at his workplace. Despite losing the election this time around, workers at RDU1 outside of Raleigh and across the country are not stepping down. Worker struggles are of course not limited to this country. In February, Abiramy Sivalogananthan of the Asia Floor Wage Alliance wrote for us about a new campaign from garment workers in the Global South to improve working conditions and hold the American companies pulling in billions from exploitation accountable. Over 1,000 workers have called on their allies in the U.S. to sign onto their campaign. Child care teacher Rita Bee shared one of the bright spots of the year — New Mexico’s adoption of universal, no-cost child care. Families will save an average of $12,000 per year — a true game-changer for low-income households in one of the country’s poorest states. The state is funding the program through taxes on oil and gas extraction from public lands. “Taking care of our children and setting them up for success is the best thing we can do for our families, our communities, and our nation,” Bee wrote. This first appeared on Inequality.org. Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy Project and co-edits Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies.

Title: Meta is changing its performance review to reward output over effort, taking a page from Amazon and X

Meta Platforms Inc. just became the latest tech company to rejig its performance review process to hone in on an employee’s output, as opposed to effort. The company is rolling out a new performance review platform called Checkpoint, which will grade workers, grouping them into four categories and rewarding top performers for exceptional work, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. “We’re evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.” The memo outlined the predicted distribution of outcomes and pay multipliers for base bonuses. About 20% of employees will be labeled “Outstanding” and will be eligible for a bonus double their pay; 70% will be labeled “Excellent” with a 115% pay bonus; around 7% will fall into the “Needs Improvement” category, eligible for a bonus up to 50% of pay. Around 3% of employees may be labeled “Not Meeting Expectations” and will be ineligible for a bonus. On the other hand, the system will reward top performers with bonuses worth up to 300%. The performance review update comes as other Big Tech companies have overhauled their performance review systems to better reflect employee performance. Amazon’s new review system asks corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work. And in 2022, Elon Musk asked X (formerly Twitter) employees to explain what they accomplished every week. Meta is planning a company-wide meeting Jan. 22 to further explain the changes to employees. The new changes will impact the 2026 performance cycle and will not change the current review cycle. The new system will entail two review cycles per year, using the same rating system each cycle. As part of this new review timeline, bonuses will be paid out twice annually. Tech companies have increasingly sought concrete examples of output as proof of productivity, requiring that employees demonstrate how well they perform. While outcomes have been a longstanding cornerstone of corporate performance reviews, the new push toward output-based assessments reflects a growing desire among tech leaders to incentivize employees to prove outstanding performance. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has pushed to reduce management layers and to eliminate bureaucracy since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2022 that he was aiming to make the company more lean to promote “product excellence and productivity.” That has been the trend at Meta, where the tech company called 2023 the “year of efficiency” as the company scaled back headcount. In 2022, the company laid off about 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees. And last year, the company cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 3,000 workers, targeting low performers. To be sure, an update to Meta’s performance review system is not a warning sign that additional layoffs are on their way. But Meta is set to announce layoffs this week in the company’s Reality Labs business, according to reporting by The New York Times, as the company scales back its metaverse unit. “We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ahead of last year’s cuts. “But now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.”

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs

Time Published: 2026-01-13T16:06:21Z

Meta is laying off around 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: 9 marketing predictions for 2026 as AI fuels polarity

Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The sense of a stable middle ground is eroding across an industry at a point of contraction, with many displaying mixed feelings about marketing’s future. The sense of a stable middle ground will continue to erode across several aspects of marketing in 2026. Studies indicate the middle class is thinning, altering important consumer milestones. Monoculture is also on the wane as people spend more time engaged with algorithms hypertailored to their interests. On the industry front, marketing services are gravitating toward two polarities in the wake of historic consolidation: White-glove models and plug-and-play ones built around artificial intelligence. Feeling some of the most pain from these developments are the employees who make the industry hum but are facing a grim job market. “There has been a rampant uptick in the past few years of putting the focus on shareholder value,” said Dustin Black, executive creative director at Preston Spire. “Culturally, the difference between decision-makers and makers has never been greater.” The advancement of generative AI could encourage mediocrity — “slop” was deemed a 2025 word of the year for a reason — but also benefit marketers moving against the grain. To grab attention, brands may embrace messaging that is deliberately button-pushing or bold. “A lot of the output is trending toward the median,” said Taryn Crouthers, CEO of Spcshp, about AI in marketing. “It’s about pulling against the median because all of the content is merging to look very, very similar.” Others could step up investment in emergent channels to reach audiences with growing economic influence, including Gen Alpha. There will be no shortage of stages to test these tactics, with a Super Bowl, Olympics and FIFA World Cup on deck. Below, Marketing Dive shares nine predictions for an industry at a point of contraction and displaying mixed feelings about its future. Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group signals more agency consolidation coming down the pike, experts say. As rumors swirl around additional breakups and sell-offs, a new chapter is on the horizon for ad-holding groups. “It’s absolutely signifying a shift towards media and technology scale as key foundational elements for what the legacy holding companies will reorganize around,” said Jay Pattisall, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, of the Omnicom-IPG deal. Dealmaking activity could be enabled by further interest rate cuts and a light-touch regulatory environment. Other agencies may broker richer strategic partnerships: For example, Publicis kicked off 2026 by striking a pact with LiveRamp, underpinning the significance of data in the AI arms race, Ad Age reported. Massive layoffs and the death of iconic creative shops — not to mention the likelihood of future cost-cutting measures — have been painful but also mean that an army of talent is seeking its next venture. “You might see a lot of these former executives trying to start their own firms playing to the more niche side of the marketplace,” said Paul Hardart, a clinical professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Independents meanwhile may pursue different routes to expansion. ZMC-backed Wpromote’s purchase of Giant Spoon in late 2025 speaks to the role private equity is playing in the formation of “big indies” that could appeal to deep-pocketed brands. “Not tomorrow, not next month, but in the not-so-distant future, there are going to be more options for enterprise marketers to choose from as a result of the private-equity investments in what we historically call independent digital agencies,” said Pattisall. Brands will further push the limits of AI-generated creative in 2026, with football’s big night acting as a key litmus test. Svedka already announced it will run a Super Bowl spot made with AI, but the spirits maker won’t be the only advertiser putting on an AI showcase. “I would say, more likely than not, 50% of all Super Bowl spots we watch this year will utilize generative AI in some facet,” said Chris Neff, chief AI officer at Anomaly, noting that those applications could be in pre-production and not immediately apparent on screen. While the AI content spigot is flowing, marketers will explore different messaging avenues. Brands, including Equinox and Dollar Shave Club, have recently launched campaigns that prod at the backlash to AI slop while still leveraging generative AI tools. However, many continue to underestimate strong consumer aversion. “Rushing into anything — over doing things to that extent — is a mistake,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of PR firm DKC. “One thing that humans seem to still possess...is a pretty good B.S. detector.” Trepidation around AI extends into other areas, even as the technology becomes institutionalized at brands and agencies. Artificially inflated engagement may create a negative feedback loop for advertisers that are only investing more in social and digital, contributing to the Dead Internet Theory. “The bot traffic is going to increase. Is that going to make the metrics even better? Is that going to be the catalyst for this vicious cycle for it to get worse and worse and worse?” said Neff. “It's very hard to know exactly what’s real and not.” “[Brands are] playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” Bill Bruno CEO of Celebrus Advertisers, agencies and other stakeholders have spent years shoring up their land grabs in the data-driven marketing ecosystem to fuel developments like programmatic advertising and help gird against the shift from identifiers like third-party cookies. That rush for data will continue to intensify amid the rise and operationalization of AI-driven advertising, giving marketers a chance to learn and apply the lessons of previous eras. Data transparency and ownership will be key as AI complicates challenges that marketers already face around ad visibility and efficacy, especially amid the rise of zero-click search and AI-powered bots and agents that could muddy measurement waters. “You've got a lot of brands… that are basically using terms like ‘AI readiness’ that don't know what they need or what they're going to do, necessarily,” explained Bill Bruno, CEO of data firm Celebrus. “I don't think a lot of people are thinking two or three steps ahead right now. They're playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” To have a better handle on data, marketers can shift focus from collecting data to connecting it via tools like consumer data platforms and data fabric environments that give a more unified view of consumers, several experts said. That can help marketers focus on exactly what they need, rather than getting washed away in a flood of data. “My clients who have been most successful are focusing on marketing-specific use-case data readiness,” said Nicole Greene, vice president, analyst at Gartner. “Do we really know what our customers want? Can we safeguard the data that they have entrusted us with, and as a result, can we do marketing and advertising better?” "I don’t think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women... It’s more being true to what the company and what the audience is." Adam Singer Vice president of marketing at AdQuick Some of last year’s boldest advertising featured good jeans, spicy plumbers, the best car to have sex in and a full bush summer. Similarly edgy ad creative could return to the fore as marketers look to break through in an increasingly fragmented and frantic media landscape. While those campaigns relied on — and often parodied — “sex sells” tropes, their success speaks more to their ability to break through an ad landscape that has grown increasingly stale and bland, even before the rise of AI, said Adam Singer, vice president of marketing at AdQuick. “Companies have become really risk averse. I think consumers are really thirsty for brands to do things that are interesting,” Singer said. However, being bold doesn’t mean that brands must turn back the clock and revive aesthetics and attitudes that have largely fallen by the cultural wayside. “I don't think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women or even necessarily really attractive celebrities, although celebrities definitely push product,” Singer said. “It's more being true to what the company and what the audience is.” Marketers can bring this type of authenticity to life in several ways, from emotional messages to simply portraying their products with beautiful photography and videography — as long as the company is authentic to its core values. Last year’s Cracker Barrel rebrand fiasco is an example of what not to do. “Everyone tried to make that a political thing and say it was ‘woke,’ but I don't think that's really what was going on,” Singer said. “We've seen companies flattening everything, making everything a little bit more boring, and people are tired of that. They want brands to do big, bold things.” Marketers should prepare for further consolidation in an ad-tech industry that has reached maturity but continues to evolve alongside technological change. “At different areas in the ecosystem, there is a consolidation of the media activation between DSPs and SSPs — most of them are starting to compete with each other and not just partner with each other anymore,” said Mathieu Roche, CEO of identity firm ID5. In the DSP space, Amazon and Walmart continue to develop their offerings, while Microsoft’s sunsetting of Xandr provided a boost to Amazon via a transition partnership. Some brands have looked to test different sell-side workflows, including marketplace deals and guaranteed programmatic buys, especially as more connected TV inventory comes on board, said LiveRamp’s Travis Clinger. Consolidation could benefit brands and publishers as it reduces fees and the costs of operating, but the reduction of consumer choice has caused the space to face antitrust issues. Google is expected to learn the fate of its ad-tech antitrust case this year, and while it appears that it will not face more dramatic structural remedies, any decision could cause a surge in ad-tech M&A, explained Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester. “Google's competitors aren't going to let an opportunity pass them by to take advantage of any weakening of Google's position in the ad tech market,” Mitchell-Wolf said. “I do anticipate the rest of the ad tech market trying to shore up their offerings, just to prepare and posture themselves to have the maximally enticing place to land for any advertisers or publishers that take a look at what Google is offering on the tail end of this.” Though the oldest members of Gen Alpha will be turning only 16 in 2026, the generation is already making waves. The cohort already wields $28 billion in direct spending power, and its influence can be seen within the marketing strategies of brands ranging from Lowe’s to Hi-Chew. In 2026, advertiser interest in Gen Alpha, or those born between 2010 and 2024, will become more concrete, according to GWI Chief Operating Officer Misha Williams. “Thinking about [Gen Alpha] in terms of an afterthought or a demographic not to be considered when you are shaping your brand positioning … is a mistake,” said Williams. While the older end of Gen Alpha is beginning to make purchases for themselves, the cohort holds significant sway over purchases made by their parents and has already established awareness for hundreds of brands. The group is also being raised in the age of social media algorithms and AI, priming them to expect deeper personalization from brands compared to previous generations, Williams explained. “With access to information, people become more aware of what they like, what they don’t like,” Williams said. “So when you’re talking about Gen Alpha and the fact that they’re so young, a critical mistake is to treat them as such.” Brands targeting Gen Alpha should expect media consumption behavior that’s even more fragmented than their Gen Z predecessors, Williams said. The cohort is also more inclined to lean on their social connections to validate whether or not a brand or product aligns with their lifestyle, making it critical for marketers to find an authentic value proposition. “What you’re putting in front of them, from an advertising and marketing perspective, must be authentic,” Williams said. “It has to resonate with them contextually.” "It’s not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult." Dipanjan Chatterjee Vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Social media and creator-led marketing surged in 2025 as giants like PepsiCo and Unilever evolved how they work with agencies and dramatically boosted their investments, a signal of the growing role both channels play in shaping culture. Interest is expected to grow in 2026, with creator ad spend in the U.S. forecast to climb 18% year over year, per the IAB. The bet is a signal that marketers have begun to value community over reach, according to Movers+Shakers Chief Creative Officer Geoffrey Goldberg. Brands will likely direct much of their budgets to smaller creators this year, Goldberg forecasts, noting that AI could help streamline the process by helping marketers scale content volume and better understand target audiences. However, category interest is bound to emphasize growing pains. For example, a rise in AI content on social feeds will likely pressure creators to strengthen their creative muscles to cut through the noise. “Already, the amplification of content and the different styles of content has upped so much because of AI … there’s a lot more people in the playing field,” Goldberg said. “The algorithms are still prioritizing great content, it’s prioritizing that over followers.” A surge in content could see both social media teams and consumers faced with burnout as more brands opt for always-on strategies. Broadly, as social media becomes a more foundational aspect of marketers’ playbooks, concerns around a lack of measurement standardization will only grow, a challenge Goldberg recommends brands approach by prioritizing metrics that prove engagement. “In order for [social] to really be their operating system, we need to be really clear on how we measure success and there’s no singular, clear metric,” Goldberg said. Sports marketing will be a major avenue for marketers looking to reach consumers in an increasingly fractured advertising landscape in 2026. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2026 Winter Olympic Games will deliver captive linear TV audiences while emerging sports and leagues create avenues for marketers to connect with more niche, but growing, consumer groups. “One of the things we're seeing is a really incredible momentum behind a lot of small, micro leagues from a familiarity perspective. They’re not super well known yet, but of the people who are aware of them, they have just incredible momentum. They're personally relevant, culturally relevant. They're really sort of poised to take off,” said Jennifer Musil, global president of research at The Harris Poll. Women’s sports will continue to gain momentum in 2026, especially as more niche sports and leagues become more popular. For example, upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled signed Maker’s Mark, a Beam Suntory Brand, as its first-ever official spirits partner in December. Women’s sports leagues give small and large brands alike an opportunity to get in early as audiences continue to grow. “Seven of the top 10 leagues in the last data set we looked at from a momentum perspective, are female leagues. So women's sports still has a ton of momentum behind it. It's not done growing yet,” said Musil. Tariffs chaos and confusion will not be left behind in 2025, but will continue to cause issues for marketers and consumers alike in 2026. Economic concerns, such as increased cost of living and inflation, may only exacerbate the issue. While the advertising industry has remained remarkably resilient in the face of tariffs and global ad revenue is expected to climb 8.8% in 2026, the Trump administration’s approach to international trade is expected to still create stress for adland. The on-and-off-again nature of tariffs and the steady rise in prices of imported goods makes it difficult for consumers to create and stick to a budget, which may translate to less discretionary spending. “CMOs are marketing to the end consumer. What is going on with tariffs is exceptionally chaotic because it makes it impossible for consumers to be able to plan their own budgets…because there is complete turbulence as it relates to tariffs," said Mike Proulx, vice president, research director, Forrester. Ultimately, marketers will have to adapt their strategies to better handle uncertainty. This could mean shorter campaigns and quicker turnaround times and an increased focus on value. As consumers tighten their purse strings, putting an emphasis on value and deals could help mitigate some of the chaos of the current economic landscape. This was already a major focus for advertisers in 2025 and could continue to be a viable strategy for 2026. “Over the last couple of years, marketers have gotten used to planning in an environment of considerable volatility. In reality, you can't plan for anything, yet you have to plan,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president, principal analyst, Forrester. “It's not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Planning around tariff disruption echoes the pandemic, a moment the industry did not always meet with agility or savvy investment decisions.

Title: Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donates $45 million to LGBTQ+ youth hotline organization, The Trevor Project

The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said.

Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it's not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations' business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization's revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization's annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott's team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? ... What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott's second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project's mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott arrives at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, March 4, 2018, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the 988 service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. Since the program’s end, The Trevor Project’s hotline has become even more central to mental health support for queer young people, said Scott Bertani, director of advocacy at the National Coalition for LGBTQ Health. “Their services fill a gap that generic crisis lines simply aren’t designed to meet, particularly for young people facing identity-based stress, isolation or rejection,” Bertani said in a statement. The Trevor Project has faced internal turmoil after its budget grew from around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July.

Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track.

Title: Media buyers say Yahoo’s DSP is one to watch

Time Published: 2026-01-12T05:01:00Z

Keep up to date with Digiday’s annual coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. More from the series → After Yahoo was sold by Verizon Wireless to Apollo Global, many deemed it a trade-down, with exits to private equity often interpreted as a last shot at relevance. Since that 2021 deal, it has undergone a reputational turnaround among parts of the advertising industry, even if the aggressive advance of another challenger has blunted its momentum. Most recently, Yahoo’s demand-side platform has become a source of genuine curiosity — and in some cases cautious enthusiasm — among media buyers. Conversations with senior agency leaders point to tangible product progress: a clearer AI roadmap, an expanding commerce media footprint, and a more coherent identity spine. That momentum was underscored during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, when Yahoo confirmed earlier reports that it was updating its buying platform with agentic AI capabilities, following months of industry speculation around AI-driven workflow changes inside DSPs. Yet recent developments, including a fresh round of layoffs — the depth of which Yahoo declined to detail — reinforce a broader truth: even with renewed interest, Yahoo remains firmly in challenger territory. That challenge is sharpened by Amazon’s DSP, which continues to grow at a pace buyers describe as difficult for the rest of the field to match, particularly as it pushes further into premium video, commerce media, and full-funnel measurement — a strategy Digiday has previously detailed in its coverage of how Amazon is reshaping the DSP category. This leaves Yahoo in a nuanced middle position: materially improved, increasingly well regarded by sophisticated traders, and generating real buzz — but operating in a market increasingly defined by platform scale. Sources close to the company describe the past year as a “technical reset” for Yahoo DSP. At CES, Yahoo confirmed the platform has undergone a multi-phase rebuild designed to reposition it as an AI-native buying environment, moving beyond legacy automation toward an agentic model. Under this approach, AI systems assist with planning, optimize bidding and pacing, surface cross-channel opportunities, automate elements of measurement, and reduce executional friction for traders. Rather than black-box automation, the emphasis is on embedding always-on intelligence across the workflow — echoing broader buyer demands for explainability Digiday has reported on in AI-driven media buying. Central to that shift is what Yahoo calls a “Yours, Mine, and Ours” framework, which it announced on Jan. 6 at CES. Advertisers can deploy their own AI agents, rely on Yahoo’s native agents, or connect the two through APIs and Model Context Protocols. The intent is to allow external models to participate directly in activation, troubleshooting, and audience discovery within governed data boundaries — a more open stance than rivals that tightly control AI extensibility. At launch, Yahoo said agentic capabilities already live include AI-assisted campaign activation, proactive troubleshooting for pacing and delivery issues, and audience exploration via programmatic access to Yahoo DSP metadata. More advanced optimization, QA, and measurement agents are expected through 2026. Multiple sources describe the DSP as central to Yahoo’s long-term strategy, even as speculation around a potential sale persists. Internally, it is viewed as a growth engine and the focal point of broader tech modernization — a theme consistent with Digiday’s prior reporting on private-equity-owned media companies refocusing on ad tech. Recent evolution includes a year-long infrastructure overhaul, a widened push toward mid-market advertisers, new commerce media partnerships, and the formal unveiling of its agentic roadmap at CES. Commerce media has emerged as one of Yahoo DSP’s more unexpected strengths. Buyers say its ability to blend retail data with ConnectID, extend into categories where Amazon is less dominant, and layer commerce signals across Yahoo-owned properties gives it a differentiated role — particularly as the category accelerates, as Digiday has outlined in its coverage of commerce media’s expansion beyond retail giants. Several senior agency executives say the platform has materially improved across UI, workflow, identity resolution, and support. Crucially, it has retained advanced trader controls at a time when rivals are abstracting them away — a dynamic Digiday has previously examined in relation to The Trade Desk and DV360 tightening control. Despite improved sentiment, challenges remain. Demand diversification has thinned following multiple rounds of layoffs, with the DSP team taking disproportionate hits, according to sources. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo DSP enters 2026 as a technically stronger, AI-forward, commerce-media-capable alternative at a moment when buyers are hungry for options. But the market is consolidating rapidly around Amazon, Google, and The Trade Desk. The question is whether improved tooling and agentic ambition are enough in a category increasingly defined by scale. Technology is seen by indies as a potential great equalizer when it comes to delivering solutions for clients, and competing with bigger agencies. Ad tech’s recent lexicon suggests “programmatic” will soon ceded way ground to “agentic.” The gap between Publicis, which ended up the year $9.5 billion in the positive, and second place Dentsu with $1.7 billion, is cavernous.

Title: Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service | TechCrunch

The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.” Topics Transportation Editor Plan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.

Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.
