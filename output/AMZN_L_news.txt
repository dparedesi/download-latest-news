The year 2025 was a bloodbath for film, streaming, television, and news workers in Hollywood as the media continued its downward spiral from its once commanding position as a leading American institution. The Wrap reports that television and film lost upwards to 17,000 jobs in 2025, a loss 18 percent higher than last year. News divisions, for instance, cut about 2,254 jobs across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming services through November of 2025. The loss, though, fell below the 4,537 job losses in 2024. “The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation,” the Wrap added. The FCC approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media and as the year came to a close Warner Bros. Discovery also began its move to merge with whatever outfit will end up buying it in the coming year. But job loss was a constant across it all. Even Disney continued its trend of mass layoffs despite still holding out on its own. The layoffs will continue, too, and Artificial Intelligence might be to blame for much of it. According to the World Economic Forum, 41 percent of companies worldwide will lay off workers over the next five years because they intend to begin increasing reliance on AI technology. One example is the workforce depletion at Amazon, which castoff 14,000 employees in October. This AI issue has already cost tens of thousands of current and future jobs in Hollywood, analysts say. A report from June noted that as many as 200,000 Hollywood jobs will either be lost or won’t ever be created thanks to AI. Still, some new jobs will undoubtedly be created because of AI as some workers will be needed to control the tech. Regardless, The Wrap added that 71,000 layoffs occurred in 2025 thanks to AI. At year’s end, the biggest loser appears to be Paramount, which shed 2,000 employees. Comcast’s Versant cable shed 150, which was seven percent of its workforce, and Disney laid off less than 800 across its various holdings and divisions worldwide, The Wrap continued. After years of heavier layoffs, Warner Bros. only shed about 100 across its cable holdings. But that will certainly tick upward once WBD is bought out next year. In fact, some analysts expect WBD to lose upwards to 6,000 employees after its buyout. The film industry in Los Angeles continued to contract in 2025. Hollywood had lost 100,000 jobs by the end of 2024 — or a 30 percent decline — as film and TV productions moved to other U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, or places overseas. And by April of this year, Hollywood ranked in only 6th place for the number of film and TV productions operating there. And Deadline reported in October that the downward trend in film and TV production continued through the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, media otherwise also continued contracting as news and print media either laid off workers, canceled expansion plans, or shut down completely. Publishers Dotdash Meredith dumped 143 employees, and then after the rebranded to People Inc., shed another 226. The Washington Post eliminated four percent of its workforce, or 100 workers, CNN dumped 200 staffers, PBS laid off 15 percent of its workforce, CBS News cancelled the streaming companions to CBS Mornings and CBS News and eliminated those employees, and Business Insider dumped 21 percent of its staff. Layoffs were also felt at Variety, Rolling Stone, and Billboard. The media will continue facing tough times next year and there seems to be no end yet in sight to a leveling.

Title: Looking Forward into 2026 – Predictions for a New Year
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2026/01/01/looking-forward-into-2026-predictions-for-a-new-year/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T18:15:46Z

It is time again. Here we sit at the start of a new year and I am once again going to don the mantle of an oracle… false oracle to be sure, but let me do my cosplay… and foretell the doom of this next spin around the sun. And after 2025, I am in a foul mood. It is easy to be that guy who sees only the bad outcomes. As the quote goes: Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend So you’ll have to pardon me if my 2026 predictions… and we’re back to predictions after 2025 failed to deliver on wishes in dramatic style… if they are not rife with sunshine and lollipops. Welcome to 2026 That said I once again want to remind people that predictions are not wishes. These are not things I want to come to pass. They are things I think are likely to come to pass given past behavior and the state of the industry and the economy overall. If I am bleak, it is merely because I have been conditioned by the world to have that point of view. For those wanting a past accounting… well, who am I to tell you what to do with your free time. But there is a history here. Now I am back around for another turn. So let’s get on with it. What will 2026 bring? 1. Bloodbath at Redwood Shores EA will be… well, I am not sure what it will be at the end of 2026. But I am pretty sure the Saudis will be getting out the bone saws once more and what was once EA will end up with more pieces cut off than Jamal Khashoggi corpse in the embassy in Istanbul. This seems like a gimme frankly. 2. More Microsoft Mayhem Phil Spencer has but two choices to keep his obscene annual bonus going. He either has to improve sales or he has to cut expenses. Given where the industry has been headed, and the unfavorable reaction to the price increase for the XBox Game Pass, I am going to bet on cost cutting. And what is the biggest expense? Employees. If they don’t cut at least another 1,000 staff from the XBox division I will be amazed. My final score on this one will be the percentage actually cut relative to 1,000. So nobody gets laid off, zero points. But if Phil axes 2,000 people, I am claiming 20 points. So basically, 0.01 points per person laid off. Sorry to value people at such a low rate, but at least I am not throwing them out in the street personally. 3. WoW Midnight Modest Launch We already have a date. I started sketching this post back in October and had a placeholder for the launch date, picking April 20th. But now we know it will be here on March 2, 2026, much earlier than I expected. So prediction alteration time! I am going to predict that there will be no follow up press release about how WoW Midnight was a huge success with cherry picked metrics to prove it was the best ever… WoW expansion with housing, for example, because I think Warlords of Draenor will probably still be ahead of it, and Tom Chilton telling us all that garrisons were housing counts in my book. I will allow no ret-con of that. 4. The Big Chill for WoW Classic My gut and intuition says that the J. Allen Brack “you think you do, but you don’t” faction gained ascendancy at Blizz when WoW Classic didn’t turn into a low-effort eternal cash machine. Between them dropping WoW Midnight on top of the WoW Anniversary Classic launch of The Burning Crusade and the retail team just straight up taking the nostalgia card for itself in the form of the remix seasons to fill out the fact that they cannot, after more than 20 years, make an expansion with two years of content (or make expansions faster FFS), WoW Classic seems on the outs. So my prediction is no new servers, no speeding up the languishing expansions, and absolutely no movement on anything that might feel even a bit like Classic Plus. WoW Classic Warlords of Draenor will land in the back third of the year and that will be it. I am going to claim five bonus points if Blizz puts out a roadmap and doesn’t bother to include and WoW Classic plans. 5. Nothing Else New in Irvine For all the resources they have and the mighty reputation they have earned for quality and polish and stealing ideas and reinventing them better, Blizzard will bring nothing new to the table in 2026. No announcements, no surprises, no additions to their lineup. They will be milking their current titles until the last layoff. See, doing something new is much higher risk than living on past glory. 6 . Lawsuit Wins for Against Pirate Servers Both Blizzard and Daybreak will win their cases against Turtle WoW and The Heroes Journey respectively. I think that is pretty much a gimme here. The case law is clear and none of the arguments offered justify taking another companies IP and assets to start their own business. Fan arguments in support of either made up requirements or different layers of “but I want it.” Now, will the win help the companies or actually shut down similar operations? Not a prediction that is part of the scoring, but I will say “no” on both counts. 7. A Rain of Tears in Norrath Ongoing poor performance by the aging stable of Daybreak titles is going to mean layoffs. Again, predictions are not wishes, but we’ve seen how this has gone in the past… and all the more so with Eros Capital Partners AB now heading the board following their demand for more cash payments straight to their pockets. This will be why, the explanation for my prediction below about an EQII special rules server for 2026. 8. H1Z1 is Still Dead Like the bit about Generalissimo Francisco Franco back in the early SNL days, H1Z1 is not coming back from the dead no matter how many times Ji Ham says to investors that it is an extremely important IP in the Daybreak portfolio. The promise of a new version of the game with a 2026 release will be revealed a fiction… or, more likely, not revealed at all as the Ji Ham is likely to pull a John Riccitiello SWTOR move and drop all mention and claim it isn’t what investors are interested in if pressed at the earnings call. 9. EverQuest 3 Same as H1Z1. It’s dead Jim… or Firiona… or whoever. Daybreak will only buy new titles, like Palia, but won’t make anything outside of their current MMO lines. We probably won’t KNOW it is dead, but it will be the old school Daybreak treatment of never mentioning it again… certainly not in 2026. 10. EverQuest Special Rules Server for 2026 The EQ team is under some pressure. Numbers are down and The Heroes Journey was alleged to have been pulling in something around $100K a month for a dumbed down, multi-box, speed leveling version of the game. (Yes, there was more to it, but I swear that is all most people gushing about it seemed to mention.) That has to have made some impression on the team. Enough to get through their “Hardcore Heritage Forever” mindset? One hopes. What they should do is work on a “Tour de Norrath” special server. Bonus xp, mob health all dropped to make most things soloable at level, even by a warrior who can only shield bash and kick with their auto attack, with expansions being dropped at a dizzying rate; something like 8 weeks for vanilla and then 4-6 weeks for every expansion thereafter. Raids will be sized so that a group of three can do them, save for the Sleeper, who will require a full group. What they will do is turn the dials they already have… xp rate, unlock rate, starting expansion… and pretend they have done something new and innovative. It will not thrill. [I wrote this before we got the news about what Daybreak was planning, but now we know that. so how it plays out will be the biggest part of any scoring.] 11. EverQuest II Special Rules Server for 2026? Nope! We’re not going to get one for 2026. Reasons noted above, but also their popularity has not been established the way the EQ versions have. 12. Norrath Expansions All the same, both EQ and EQII will announce Q4 expansions that will riff off of some location we have visited already. That seems like a safe bet even with the last part. Not a 100% gimme this time. 13. LOTRO Difficult Issue Avoidance SSG has made it clear that they are going nowhere near the scourging of the Shire until they have milked the rest of the appendices of the series completely dry of content and they have trivialized the breadth of Middle-earth with murder for hire and FedEx quests. They’re like the Borg of Middle-earth, and all must be assimilated. But I think they have gone far enough south into Harad. They will need to go in another direction. So, my prediction in three parts; there will be an expansion (2 points), it will ship in December (2 points), and it will be set in the east, somewhere along the shores of the Sea of Rhun (6 points). Fight me! 14. New Eden: Two Expansion, Two Events, One Fanfest EVE Online will follow the now well set pattern of days, with a spring and fall (or summer and winter to use their terms, but May and November aren’t summer or winter where I live) expansion and the Crimson Harvest and Winter Nexus events… and Fanfest. And that will be the roadmap for 2026. Anything else will just be some login rewards, Twitch drops, and a cash shop sale. 15. New Eden to Remain Just EVE Online Neither EVE Vanguard nor EVE Frontier will progress to the point of even an early access launch. The former will remain the wet dream of a few key individuals at the company who still want to will this into being after 15 years of failure. It isn’t going to happen. The latter… well, CCP simply won’t be able to solve the economic contradictions of blockchain, which tries to pretend that supply and demand isn’t a thing. But they cannot drop it due to Marc Andreeson’s money paying the bills, but doing what Andreeson wants will drive any actual gamers away, leaving just the speculator class looking for another get rich quick scheme. If they ship, they die, so they will continue to pretend to be trying to solve the problem while cashing Andreeson’s checks. 16. Drone Regions Consolidation One of the big changes in New Eden this year was the evacuation of the Drone Regions of null sec and the subsequent land rush by smaller groups to grab territory there. There were about 20 groups on the map at one point. That has already slimmed down to 14. By the time we get around to scoring this I am going to say there will be just three groups, either alliances or recognized coalitions of alliances, in the Drones. 17. NetEase to Buy CCP from Pearl Abyss We got hints that CCP was being shopped around in 2025 and, frankly, there are few suitors that make as much sense as NetEase. They already run the EVE Online server in China as well as EVE Echoes. Why not buy the whole thing? They don’t have to close the deal in 2026, they just have to announce it. I mean, the gaming press acts like any such announcement means the deal is complete anyway, so why fight it? The only alternatives are Tencent buying them or Crimson Desert being a smash hit. I’ll give myself a couple points for either of those options just because I mentioned them. But it has to be NetEase for the full 10 points. 18. The Crimson Desert Blahs Years in the making… and promising… we have a ship date for Crimson Desert at last. March 19th. And, frankly, they had better make that date. What then? Will this be the massive hit with rave reviews that restores the fortunes of Pearl Abyss and allow them to hold onto CCP while getting out from under their bad investments. I don’t think so. But how to quantify that for a prediction? Well, thanks to Fantasy Critic League, I now pay attention to review scores. So I will go with that. Crimson Desert is going to land with an Metacritic review score of 80, which is the honorable mention, fine work but not outstanding bracket a lot of game land in. So a score of 80 gets my a full 10 points, but I will tick off 2 points for each point its score goes above or below 80. That will be the partial credit metric. 19. The Perilous voyage of a Ship of Heroes I mean, they shipped their game. They got the business model completely wrong and now it peaks at 10 concurrent players on a good weekend. That is completely unsustainable. There will be no subscription requirement by the end of the year. That simply has to go. Big titles cannot sustain that, these guys certainly won’t make it work. That means it will go “buy to play,” will institute a free to play mode, or will simply shut down. But the subscription idea will die in 2026. Jan 2 addendum: Another one I wrote in October and then forgot to go edit. This already happened, I even wrote about it. So, zero points for predicting the past. Going to need one of those bonus predictions to land if I want a perfect 300 score! 20. Camelot Undone I see three paths forward for this incredibly late bloomer of a title. We’re already a dozen years past the promised ship date… still two years shy of the Duke Nukem Forever slip, but nothing to be proud of either… and the madness of Mark Jacobs is going to have to find an endgame somewhere. So my prediction, like Gaul, is divided into three possibilities. Given the complete lack of success of their other title, Final Bland: Ragnarok, which is now dead and gone, why would we believe Camelot Unchained is going to do any better. At some point investors are going to stop writing checks. The industry remains in a down cycle, investors are already skittish, further funding will look like throwing good money after bad. My special favorite because “Angry Marc” Andreeson, a man so lacking in self reflection that he has become the Pillsbury Doughboy parody of Sand Hill Road venture capitalist, has no interest in video games except to the extent that they further his desire to make even more unearned wealth by implementing a tax on the internet through blockchain. I am going to give myself 10 points if one of these comes to pass… but if Mark Jacobs manages to pull of a second I am going to grant myself a bonus five points, with a full 10 point bonus if he manages the hat trick. [This was the first prediction I wrote back in October, and I was in a bad mood. But it is so complicated, I am going to leave it as is in tribute to past me.] 21. Palworld Injunction Nintendo has been pissed about Palworld for quite a while now and has gone so far as to get patents approved that seem aimed and going after any title that emulates the whole “throw an object to catch a pet” idea that they see as the heart of its Pokemon titles. This year we’re going to get a resolution… and Nintendo is going to lose, having pushed too far while ignoring prior art. 22. No Man’s Sky 10th Anniversary We’ll get a bit update for the game’s tenth birthday. That goes without saying. And it will be a lot of cool stuff. But it won’t hit like Voyagers did with the introduction of corvettes. Peak concurrent users on Steam will be my measure for this. I am going to take stand at the 50K line and my score will go down 2 points for every 10K above that the game goes. This is one where I want to be wrong, but I have to look at history. 23. No Man’s Sky All About the Base Meanwhile, my stab at what we will get in 2026 is bases. The whole base building aspect of the game is a bit chaotic, tossed together, and feels like there is a lot of room to improve. So Hello Games is going to go all in on making sure you can make the space home of your dreams, with a landing pad that will work for your damn corvette already. 24. No Fire to be Lit Light No Fire will remain a ghost title for 2026. No dates, no early access, no roadmap, just vague news and nothing for players at all. 25. Guild Wars: Reforged Content Pack ArenaNet, caught by surprise by the success of Guild Wars: Reforged, will announce a content update for the game. It won’t be a whole new campaign, or even something as big as Eye of the North, but the game has demonstrated that there is demand for it, so why not give the players what they want? 26. Guild Wars 2 Expansion as Usual The pattern has been set, NCsoft expects the income, we’re just going to get another one. Probably in August. Seems about right. 27. No Official Announcement for Guild Wars 3 I mean, doesn’t ArenaNet have enough on its plate. There might be a leak or some discussion of a possibility of such an eventuality… I mean, they have to let GW2 sit untouched for a decade or so in order to go back and farm that the way they did the original… but we’re not there yet for a commitment. 28. The End of the New World as We Know It Amazon will announce the end date for New World. It might not end in 2026, but the end times will be marked in the calendar. We know it is happening and we know that Amazon isn’t going to do something like Dual Universe and make the game playable after the servers close. It will just be the end of days… so get started on that emulator now! 29. Squadron 42? More Like Squadron 86! Chris Roberts was absolutely positive that the long delayed Squadron 42 spin-off of the Star Citizen universe will ship in 2026. He says it is done and fully playable. There was even a special email update about it with “2026” in a huge size to emphasize the point. At this point I simply don’t believe him. No Squadron 42 launch… and I am going to give myself 9 point if we get some chickenshit “well, it is alpha now so you cannot criticize it” routine like we’ve had for Star Citizen for the last decade. Cloud Imperium has yet to ship a game and I don’t see that trend changing in 2026. 30. Not Coming Back Crowfall will remain dead. Alganon too. Seems like a gimme, but somebody out there believes these will return. Bonus Picks! Bonus picks are extra credit, wild ass guesses that don’t count against me if they fail to come to pass, but which get me some points if they somehow manifest into the real world. Bonus Pick 1 – AI to the Death Some studio… will it be you Krafton, or maybe this is a job for the petty and vindictive Tim Sweeney… will go all in on making a game with AI code, art assets, and audio. And it will crash and burn, becoming a complete disaster. This will need to be a big game. If you point out somebody did a tic-tac-toe title with AI, that isn’t going to count. This doesn’t mean somebody ruining their reputation by embracing AI publicly… again, Krafton, EA, and Tim Sweeney are already in that boat… but actually putting their money where there mouth is. Likewise, public revulsion and refusal to buy the game is out of bounds, it actually has to get reviewed and be announced to suck. The only reason this is a bonus pick is I am running a project that is using AI to code it and I have my doubts about the ability to produce anything complex. Bonus Pick 2 – Sports Betting Comes to EA! In looking at the Saudi purchase of EA, I am trying to figure out the upside financially. I mean, sure, the EA Sports franchise can spin money, but not enough to make the deal a net win. Meanwhile, sports betting apps are making so much money off of people that they are buying tons of ads during events to keep the gravy train running. And the Saudis know this. So I suspect that we’ll get some sort of announcement of an integration between EA Sports and gambling, likely first with the NFL, who will go along when the Saudis give them a cut. Summing Up So those are the predictions for 2026. That is 30 predictions to measure this year. Unless otherwise stated, each are worth 10 points, with partial credit available. I have a couple in there that could give me some extra credit, but we shall see if I get any of that. There are also bonus picks. I might add some more of those. But no ret-conning. I promise that. As always, the deadline is December 15th for things to come to pass. So if Amazon announces the end of New World on the 16th, I lose. But if Squadron 42 somehow ships on or after December 16th, I win, full points. That is a hard date. Now we’re off into the new year to see what becomes of us. I’d put one in place from my perspective: WoW private server (prospective) teams will have learned from Turtle WoW and won’t advertise or poke the bear, but instead will quietly continue to gain support for a Classic Plus on their own terms. If Turtle WoW didn’t do the stupid crap they were doing and essentially daring Microsoft to go after them, they’d still be around and doing Classic Plus their way. Other dev teams will learn from that and do their Classic Plus quietly. LikeLike 19. Ship of Heroes is already ‘buy to play’ in 2025. https://shipofheroes.com/new-low-price-no-subscription/ Do you get points for that? LikeLike Crap, you’re right. That was one of my early predictions and then they made the change and I already forgot I had written about it. Well, that will teach me to proof read. Zero points for predicting the past. I am already 10 points down! Let me go edit that so I don’t forget… AGAIN! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Year ender 2025: Amazon, Meta and other major tech giants announced massive job cuts. Why 2025 became year of layoffs

Year Ender 2025: 2025 saw massive job cuts across major companies, especially in tech. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google led the way. This wave of layoffs was driven by rapid AI adoption and automation. Companies realized pandemic hiring had made them inefficient. The United States alone saw over 1.1 million layoffs, the highest since 2020. This marks a significant industry reset.

Title: For platforms, here’s what’s not going to happen in 2026
URL: http://digiday.com/marketing/for-platforms-heres-whats-not-going-to-happen-in-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
TikTok existing in the U.S. beyond the realms of a legal ban, Meta winning its antitrust trial, and Omnicom partnering with X were not quite on Digiday’s bingo card for 2025. Which is to say that trying to predict, especially in the world of tech and platforms, what might actually materialize at any time, let alone next year, is nearly impossible. After all, a lot of what the industry thought might happen in 2025, just didn’t. Which is why Digiday has taken a slightly different approach to 2026. Instead of predicting what might happen, here is what Digiday believes won’t actually happen in next year. However long it takes (12 months and counting), the U.S. deal with China over TikTok cannot live in limbo forever. But in the meantime, marketers are simply getting used to living with its uncertainty. As Brainlabs’ managing director of paid social, Michelle Wiltz put it, the political theater around TikTok isn’t designed for resolution but for leverage. Both governments benefit from keeping the ambiguity alive. “2026 won’t deliver a clean answer about TikTok’s U.S. ownership,” she said. “Instead, it will reinforce a new operating reality: geopolitical ambiguity is a feature, not a bug and smart marketers plan for resilience, not resolution.” Nothing has come close to what Twitter was in terms of TK. Even as X, its real-time factor is its USP — something no platform has been able to replicate. And while ads are already being tested on Threads, it’s still a long way off from getting the type of attention that warrants it becoming a viable advertising track in its own right, rather than a nice add-on placement in Meta’s Advantage+. As Collective Measures’ group director of performance media, Lauren Beerling noted, Twitter wasn’t just a text-based feed, it was heavily driven by journalists, politicians, breaking news, and cultural urgency. “Threads is intentionally avoiding that energy, meaning it won’t inherit the same commercial value,” she said. “Meta seems far more focused on making Threads a ‘pleasant conversation app’ than a real-time newswire. That will attract users, but not the intent or immediacy that generates big ad revenue.” This year was probably one of Snap’s strongest years yet. By the end of Q3, the company had made $1.51 billion in quarterly revenue. But when compared to that of its peers: Meta, YouTube, TikTok — it’s still a drop in the ocean. Basis Technologies’ client strategy and insights partner, Colleen Fielder made the point that eMarketer estimated Snap will only claim 2.1% of social ad spend in 2025. “Snap’s alternative revenue paths feel limited — the Bitmoji subscription is fairly surface-level and while there’s a lot of buzz around a Perplexity partnership, it’s far too early to treat that as a major revenue engine,” she said. Plus Australia’s ban on users under 16 and an ongoing lawsuit with the city of New York — both complicate growth and advertiser confidence. A dramatic profitability jump next year seems unlikely.” Throughout 2025, there’s been an underlying narrative: AI equals efficiency, so headcount should decrease. Except the latest industry layoffs proved that they weren’t necessarily designed to cut costs on headcount, but to open up additional revenue for AI spending. “Companies will continue to use AI to reduce labor costs — especially at the top, where efficiency narratives sell well to boards and CFOs,” said Brainlabs’ managing partner of retail, Dan Connor. “What will slow is the belief that high spending itself equals progress. Companies will stop equating massive AI budgets with innovation; 2026 is the shift from exuberance to efficiency.” Everything we’ve seen so far points to one thing only: it’s no longer IF OpenAI builds an ad business, it’s when. That’s been indirectly confirmed by CEO Sam Altman himself, head of applications Fidji Simo, the latest hires of chief revenue officer Denise Dresser and Christina MacDonald — lead counsel for ads in ChatGPT. Platforms don’t make moves without intention. “Even with the recent ‘Code Red’ which caused OpenAI to pause the ads rollout to focus on product quality, the groundwork is clearly being laid,” said Robert Kurtz, strategic business outcomes partner at Basis Technologies. “2026 feels like the year they start testing ads in earnest.” Back in April, Judge Brinkema sided with the DOJ that Google held illegal monopolies. By September, the closing stage of Google’s ad tech antitrust trial saw the DOJ target the platform’s ad tech stack — AdX. While it’s not asking for a total divestiture, pulling the exchange apart would weaken its ad server. Google’s remedies argued that the DOJ’s proposals are excessive, and offered alternative solutions — it simply wouldn’t take the result lying down. Still, that’s not to say the judge will agree, and the ultimate outcome isn’t expected until next year. Retail media exploded in 2025, creating a more complex environment for everyone. And it looks set to continue next year. “I expect continued fragmentation in 2026 with a few players growing faster, but not true consolidation yet,” said Haley Feazell, vp of global media at Mindgruve. “Real shakeouts are likely later, once growth slows, and operating costs rise — similar to the timeline we’ve seen with CTV, is my expectation.” Similarly, Basis Technologies’ evp, integrated client solutions, Amy Rumpler added that consolidation certainly won’t occur in some of the larger networks that have more advanced capabilities, and ad revenues, already realized (think CVS and Kroger). “The benefits to them owning and operating their own independent networks, where they profit off of O&O inventory and audience data, is too far along to entertain consolidation with another entity,” she said. “Unless the deal was massive (like Amazon buys all of Kroger and consolidates it with their Whole Foods brands), I don’t see it happening.” Potential investors spent 2025 at least considering the idea of buying Perplexity. Apple execs reportedly held internal talks about acquiring the AI company, as did Meta — though the latter decided to invest in ScaleAI instead. Still, what it does mean is Perplexity has spent much of the year in the shop window, while its attempts to scale its ad business barely got off the ground. But by partnering with major companies throughout 2025, such as Snap, PayPal, Pitchbook and Getty, improving its publisher monetization efforts, and releasing its browser, Comet, Perplexity has strengthened its product reach and increased revenue flow, which ultimately make Perplexity more attractive to investors or acquirers considering making an offer — and likely will next year. No one can deny that Amazon is a competitor to The Trade Desk, but it still isn’t a rival. And that’s because The Trade Desk is the DSP to the open web. It’s big enough that it hasn’t had to lower fees, and has focused on being a good partner to its agency clients. And while Amazon will continue to try and claw away at advertisers’ TTD budget (we’ve already seen from reports of Amazon offering like-for-like tests, funded by Amazon) as part of its wider aim for its DSP to become the backbone for the open web. YouTube showed its renewed confidence in live streaming with its latest product updates during its Made on YouTube event this year. And with the worries about AI overtaking creators and content, live actually bypasses those concerns. “Live is the most human format we have: messy, unedited, impossible for AI to fake convincingly (at least for now),” said Natalie Silverstein, chief innovation officer at Collectively. But more importantly, YouTube, for the most part, introduces features and tools with a long-term goal in mind. “I think it will work because everything they touch turns to gold,” said Shamsul Chowdhury, former Jellyfish exec and social media expert. “Live video has that rawness to it, almost like that added authenticity. And if they can have some brand safety measures, advertisers will play.” TikTok’s ownership drama has echoes of X (formerly Twitter), but ad performance has kept marketers for fleeing—for now. AI is altering agency business models. It’s altering the skills they’re hiring for and where they’re hiring them from, too.

Title: Saks Getting Ready for Bankruptcy After Missing Debt Payment

Saks Global is preparing shortly to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its Neiman Marcus acquisition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal noted that the high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue did not make an interest payment of over $100 million on its bonds and is talking to creditors to secure financing for the bankruptcy process. Rising inflation and a weakening labor market have slowed discretionary spending for many consumers, including on luxury items. Saks Global has had many rounds of layoffs this year. The company aims to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to reduce its debt, a Saks Global spokesperson said in September to Reuters. It also aimed to raise cash through the sale of a Beverly Hills property. In August, the company restructured debt, which included $600 million in new money, and exchanged $2.2 billion in senior secured notes. The combination of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and other luxury retail and real estate companies aims to make it easier to compete with other department stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. The deal was funded by new investors, including Amazon, Authentic Brands Group, Salesforce, and others, with $2.2 billion in senior secured notes as well as an asset-based credit facility.

Title: US jobless claims slow in last full week of 2025 amid weak labour market

November saw highest unemployment since 2021, largely attributed to federal worker reductions under Trump. Share Save Over the past week, the number of United States residents applying for unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest point in a month, according to new Labor Department statistics. The weekly data released on Wednesday came at the end of a year marked by a weak labour market, a phenomenon analysts partly blame on hiring hesitancy caused by US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Experts also warn that last week’s data may also be distorted by year-end holidays like Christmas: With the shorter work week, there was less opportunity to file unemployment claims. Wednesday’s numbers mark the final full week of unemployment data for 2025. Jobless claims for the week ending on December 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000. That was an improvement from the previous week, when the Labor Department recorded 215,000 jobless claims. Its report also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,750. The US unemployment rate reached a peak of 4.6 percent in November, the highest percentage since 2021, when the country was grappling with the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase has largely been attributed to many federal employees leaving the workforce in the wake of Trump’s widespread cuts to government staffing. Jobless claims are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and offer a real-time indicator of the health of the country’s job market. Recent US government data has revealed a labour market in which hiring has lost momentum, even as other economic indicators, including the gross domestic product (GDP), have remained strong. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average of 35,000 a month, compared with 71,000 during the 12 months prior. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank reduced its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, out of concern that the job market is weaker than it appears. The move was the Fed’s third straight rate cut, with Powell saying recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. Recent data showed the US lost 105,000 jobs in October, largely due to departing federal workers, but the US economy gained back 64,000 jobs in November. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include the shipping giant UPS, automaker General Motors, online retailer Amazon and the telecommunications firm Verizon. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Jobless claims dipped last week as layoffs remained low, despite a softening labor market. While applications fell to 199,000, analysts expected more. Recent job gains were modest, with the unemployment rate climbing. This data suggests hiring momentum has slowed, prompting the Fed to trim interest rates amid concerns about job market weakness. 2025 throwback: Op Sindoor to Shubhanshu Shukla's space mission Rajnath Singh, UP CM hoist flag at Ram Janmbhoomi Temple Sarma urges Hindus to have more children Gig workers to go on strike on Dec 31 Trains collide inside Chamoli tunnel CRPF distributes radios in Naxal-hit Bastar WB: Shah predicts 2/3rd majority BMC polls: Nomination deadline ends Assam police arrest 11 linked to IMK module We will drive out infiltrators: Amit Shah Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Searched Companies Top Calculators Top Definitions Top Slideshow Top Prime Articles Private Companies Top Commodities Top Story Listing Latest News Follow us on: Find this comment offensive?

Title: Is the US economy strong heading into 2026? The picture is complicated

The world’s largest economy is growing faster than its peers, but the divide between wealthy and poorer Americans is growing. Share Save As the United States economy heads into 2026, the report card emerging on its performance is complicated. By many measures, the world’s largest economy appears to be in a strong position. After a tumultuous year marked by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his swing towards tariffs and protectionism, recent growth has outpaced the expectations of most analysts. In a speech this month, Trump hailed his economic record, insisting that the US was on the cusp of an economic boom the “likes of which the world has never seen”. Yet nestled within the economic data are signs of weakness that hint at risks down the track. And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition. Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close: After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent. That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries. During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis. Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period. While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025. That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy. While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped. Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity. “We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera. “This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.” While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high. Yet Americans are continuing to spend. Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024. The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year. The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means. The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10. “Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said. Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure. “The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera. After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note. The benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent. While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households. Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup. Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September. While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable. Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs. Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year. “Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office. However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact. “The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said. “Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.” Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January. The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January. While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people. Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Title: Looking Back at 2025 – I Really Have to Just Focus on the Highs Again

Once again on the path out of 2025 continues with what is sometimes my final reflective post to be written during the year. The Year is 2025 There is, at this point, a long tradition of such posts here at TAGN. If you are sufficiently bored, you can indulge yourself with the musings of past years: Usually I do highs and lows. Once in a while I try highs, lows, and in between. Those are rare years. And then there are years where the lows will grind you down if you spend too much time dwelling on them, so I just have to zero in on the good things. 2024 was like that, and 2025 even more so. For years like those I have to just leave behind all the layoffs, cancellations, studio closures, corporate greed, transparent bonus chasing, lies, betrayals, and any AI related stupidity… which is 99% of the pro-AI discourse… and focus on what went right. Or at least I have to try. I cannot be held responsible for any backhanded compliments or sarcasm you may perceive. I am only human, and can only play along with so much greed and stupidity before I start using “fuck” as a modifier in every other sentence. So here we go. CCP Enad Global 7 Other MMO and Online Game Things Other Video Game Items Blogs, Social Media, Media, and Online Life That is what springs to mind in my stream of consciousness. What else good happened? 2026 It is coming. We cannot stop it. We will have to see what it brings and what we can make from that. Thanks for reminding me I really need to watch KPop Demon Hunters. I’m always late to the zeitgeist. I only just watched the first season of Arcane and I haven’t gotten to Fallout yet. I am up to speed on Stranger Things, though. Out of curiosity, other than Snoop Dogg, what’s AI about Luna? I thought it was just the same as GeForce Now only you get it bundled with Prime. Then again, I haven’t actually used it yet… LikeLike Their intro to Luna had Snoop Dogg as the inaugural entry with a promise of more AI powered titles promised, so there was an least the implication that they are going to keep pressing the “AI” button. Then again, I am starting to see some companies and pundits lauding AI in applications where it would more correctly be called “software.” So we’re getting both people predicting a perfect AI nirvana world and others trying to jump on the bandwagon by just calling all software that does any analysis of data input “AI” as opportunistic branding. LikeLike So it goes… Thanks for keeping this going. Having another average curmudgeon to sympathize with every day keeps me grounded. Good things worth mentioning… Watching Kimmel stick it to the man (and the mouse) was, at least in the end, very enjoyable. Sinners – if you haven’t seen it, see it. LikeLike I liked Sinners. My problem was that people I know who love horror could not stop saying how great it was… and it wasn’t all that. Not for me at least. But that is always a problem, when something gets built up too much based on hype. The thing with Kimmel is that it came in the context of an awful government pressuring our billionaire overlords to stifle dissent. I applaud Kimmel, but the context of the situation is still very very bad. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks EDITOR’S NOTE: This story contains discussion of suicide. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent, a surge in mental health concerns and thousands of jobs lost. The link between it all? Artificial intelligence, the buzzy yet controversial technology being depicted as the future or the stock market’s next bubble, depending on who you ask. Although AI has been a key technology behind the scenes for decades, the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022 pushed the tech to the frontlines. The rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini has gradually influenced online services used by millions every day, from Google search’s AI Mode to the AI chatbots built into Instagram and Amazon. In other words, AI is starting to reshape the front door to the internet. But 2025 was also the year AI expanded beyond our screens and began impacting national policy, global trade relations and the stock market. It also raised important questions about whether the tech should be trusted in our jobs, classrooms and relationships. That’s expected to continue in 2026. “In previous years, (AI) was a shiny new object… And I think this last year was a lot more serious uses of the technology,” said James Landay, co-founder and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “And I think people are waking up to actually understanding both some of the benefits and the risks.” Count President Donald Trump among AI’s biggest believers; the technology has been a cornerstone of his second term so far. For example, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, the posterchild of the AI boom, has become a fixture of Trump’s inner circle. And the president has used Nvidia’s and AMD’s AI processors as bargaining chips in the ongoing trade war with China. This year, Trump introduced an AI action plan aimed at stripping back regulation and boosting AI use in the government. He also signed multiple AI-related executive orders, including a controversial one seeking to block states from enforcing their own AI rules. The move was seen as a win for Silicon Valley, but online safety advocates fear it’ll enable tech companies to evade accountability for AI-related risks. Next year will likely see a legal fight over the order and states’ abilities to regulate AI — with some critics arguing it won’t hold up in court. The absence of broad AI guardrails has been in the national spotlight this year and not for good reason. A slew of reports and lawsuits this year have alleged that AI companions like ChatGPT and Character.AI have contributed to mental health episodes and, in some cases, suicide among teens. “Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.” That’s how ChatGPT is said to have responded when 16-year-old Adam Raine wrote that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that someone would find it and stop him before he committed suicide. Raine’s parents sued OpenAI in August alleging that the popular chatbot advised the teen on his suicide. OpenAI and Character.AI have since announced parental controls and other changes to improve teen safety, including removing the ability for teens to have back-and-forth conversations with chatbots on Character.AI’s app. Meta also plans to let parents block their children from chatting with AI characters on Instagram next year. But it’s not just teens; a growing number of reports have indicated that AI has contributed to isolation from loved ones and breaks from reality among adults, too. One man told CNN that ChatGPT convinced him he was making technological breakthroughs that turned out to be a delusion. OpenAI said it has worked with clinical mental health experts to enable ChatGPT to “better recognize and support people in moments of distress,” including by expanding access to crisis hotlines, pointing users towards professional help when needed and adding reminders to take breaks. Still, OpenAI has said it ultimately wants to “treat adult users like adults,” allowing them to personalize their chats and even discuss erotica with ChatGPT. Psychiatrist and lawyer Marlynn Wei told CNN that she expects AI chatbots “will increasingly become the first place people turn for emotional support,” further underscoring safety concerns. Young users are among the most likely to turn to AI for support, she said. “The limitations of general-purpose chatbots, including hallucinations, sycophancy, lack of confidentiality, lack of clinical judgment, and lack of reality testing, along with broader ethical and privacy concerns, will continue to create mental health risks,” she said via email. Mental health experts and safety advocates say they hope to see greater guardrails from tech companies, especially when it comes to young AI users. But they worry the fight over regulatory power between the states and the federal government will impact the implementation of such mandated safety measures. At the same time, huge investments are being poured into data centers and AI infrastructure. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, among others, have spent tens of billions in capital expenditures this year alone, and McKinsey & Company expects companies to invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure globally by 2030. That surge in spending has sparked concerns both for consumers and for Wall Street. Some Americans have watched their electricity bills climb and job prospects sink due to AI, while some companies behind the AI boom have seen their stock reach new heights. The massive investments have also fueled worries that the hype and spending in AI is growing faster than the tech’s true value. That’s prompted investors to grill executives at Meta and Microsoft about future returns on their AI infrastructure investments during earnings calls this year. It doesn’t help that a relatively small group of companies have seemingly driven the investments, trading money and technology back and forth. Christina Melas-Kyriazi, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said it’s common for new transformative technologies to be “overbuilt.” The big question heading into 2026 is whether investors are prepared for the volatility that comes with it, especially since she says a market correction is “likely at some point.” But they’ll likely have more data at their disposal to help make those decisions, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow for the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. He said more dashboards will likely emerge in 2026 to track how AI is impacting productivity and jobs. “The debate will shift from whether AI matters to how quickly its effects are diffusing, who is being left behind, and which complementary investments best turn AI capability into broad-based prosperity,” he said. This year, thousands of tech workers were left jobless as a wave of layoffs swept the industry. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, among other tech companies, made significant cuts to their staff, driven at least in part by AI. Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees in October in an effort to operate more leanly in the age of AI. Meta let 600 workers go from its AI division, following an earlier hiring spree, so that it, too, could be more nimble. Some believe AI will lead to more layoffs, while others say it’ll create fresh opportunities. But one thing is certain: More change is coming. “This was the year that we saw skill demands totally change when it comes to what is required to be able to pull off your job,” said Dan Roth, editor-in-chief of LinkedIn. “…And I think the answer for next year is it just accelerates.” CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.

Title: The Economic Warning Sign Hiding Behind White-Collar Layoffs

White-collar layoffs at firms like McKinsey and Amazon grab headlines for their implications about artificial intelligence and tariff pressures replacing plum jobs. But there’s another canary in the economic coal mine. What PYMNTS Intelligence calls the Labor Economy® — the roughly 60 million warehouse packers, delivery drivers, home health aides, construction workers, groundskeepers, janitors, retail associates and other blue-collar workers who keep America running — is also sending up warning signals.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ With the holiday shopping season in full swing, nearly half of United States Labor Economy workers say they have little to no confidence they can afford to buy presents without going into debt until next summer. Only 1 in 3 who hadn’t started shopping by Dec. 10 said they planned to buy anything at all, compared to 46% of other consumers. Those data points, a supplement to PYMNTS’ latest installment of the Wage to Wallet® Index, suggest pocketbook tightening across a broad swath of America that may indicate deeper trouble ahead. PYMNTS defines Labor Economy workers as people earning under $25 an hour, or less than $50,000 per year. Comprising about one-third the total U.S. workforce, they drive 15% of consumer spending, making them a significant economic bloc. When they dial back their spending, the broader economy takes a hit, creating ripple effects at the businesses their spending supports. Even small interruptions — think missed work shifts, reduced hours or a late direct deposit — can instantly stymie these workers’ ability to pay rent, buy groceries, make debt payments and pay for childcare. PYMNTS estimates that a 0.13% increase in wages for this group in November translated into roughly $2.2 billion in additional annualized spending capacity. This scant increase hardly offsets the 0.8% loss in wages in October, equivalent to an annualized $14 billion hit to GDP. That’s what makes PYMNTS’s fresh data about their holiday spending telling. The financial strain of Labor Economy workers is an early warning signs about pressures on broader economic health that may not show up in traditional metrics for months. Nearly 6 in 10 of Labor Economy workers are relying on cash or debit cards for their holiday purchases—meaning for them that if the money’s not in the account, nothing’s getting bought. Only 15% are using credit cards with the intention to pay in full at the end of the monthly billing cycle, compared to 31% of everyone else. And 4 in 10 plan to spend less this holiday season. Just 19% expect to spend more. And for many of those who do plan to shop, the financial pain won’t end come New Year’s day. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Of these consumers, 1 in 5 expect their holiday debt to take more than six months to repay, a financial ball and chain they will drag into summer 2025. The percentage is one-third higher than for non-labor economy workers, who predominantly have steadier paychecks and better access to low-interest credit. The irony is stark: The very workers powering everyone else’s year-end shopping — packing boxes, driving delivery trucks, restocking shelves, caring for families — are the ones most likely to skip it entirely or pay for it well into next year. It all reflects what PYMNTS calls a mirror economy. Somewhat but not entirely like the K-shaped economy of high earners doing well financially and middle-income and low-income ones struggling, the mirror economy reflects a “split” reality, in which economic sentiment “mirrors” the specific structural constraints a particular group operating in. Non-Labor optimism reflects an economy defined by expanding options and credit leverage , while Labor Economy pessimism mirrors a parallel reality defined by tightening constraints and personal liquidity pressure. In other words, different groups experience different economies, not one single economy in different ways. As such, the Labor Economy sentiment index reflects an economy that is no longer moving in a single direction but instead splitting along a fault line shaped by access to credit, timing of receipt and perceived opportunity. This suggests optimism in today’s economy is shaped less by overall employment levels and more by the mechanics of monthly and sometimes daily cash flow.

Title: Top 10 Stories of 2025

Each year, our most-read stories offer a snapshot of where the programmatic industry is at this moment. This year, programmatic companies faced tough decisions about privacy, awkward acquisitions and the cookie die-off that never quite happened. Programmatic is an industry that’s long past its youthful growth spurt and immaturity. Now it’s dealing with the discomfort of regulation and attention from lawmakers. While the programmatic web faced these tough decisions, connected TV felt the warm, golden glow of programmatic transformation. CTV represents an opportunity for programmatic natives and for streamers that haven’t fully embraced how data and automation can sweeten the revenue from their subscribers. Our top 10 stories highlighted programmatic growing pains, CTV’s evolution, how closely watched The Trade Desk continues to be and more. Here they are, starting at the top: 1. Google Is Found Guilty Of Operating An Ad Tech Monopoly (!) (April) Our top story of the year should come as no surprise to our readers. What happens to Google’s sell-side ads business affects everyone in the programmatic industry. The remedies to Google’s monopoly will have particular resonance among publishers and SSPs. The guilty verdict found that Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server with its ad exchange, setting the stage for the remedies phase in the fall, when the judge decided what punishment to mete out to Google. 2. Microsoft Is Shutting Down Invest, The One-Time AppNexus DSP Business (May) Over the years, stories about AppNexus (later renamed Xandr, then Microsoft Invest) always ranked among the most popular AdExchanger stories – both because of its independent stance as a foil to Google and its attention-grabbing moves as a company. So it makes sense that the AppNexus DSP did not go quietly into the night. Industry leaders paid attention to what this shutdown means for the broader DSP and SSP space as well as Microsoft’s strategy. 3. The Trade Desk Is Acquiring Advertising Metadata Startup Sincera (January) The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk …. made an acquisition. TTD reversed its historically un-acquisitive approach this year and bought Sincera, known for gathering advertising metadata to stamp out fraud and help advertisers improve their decision-making. In the months since, Sincera’s co-founder Mike O’Sullivan has become a public-facing decision-maker and representative for the DSP, and Sincera’s tech has woven itself into the Trade Desk’s seller strategy. 4. The Record CCPA Fine Against Healthline Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Publishers (July) The specter of CCPA enforcement has loomed over the programmatic industry for years. And Healthline’s fine, the first one to hit a publisher, offered a concrete example of what media companies have to worry about it. Tracking pixels and cookies on the health publisher’s site, a common addition to publishers’ sites, could telegraph a person’s health status. For publishers that have long gathered behavioral data about users based on the type of articles they read, this fine signaled the types of behaviors being tracked – as well as tracking, period – are no longer in compliance with the law. 5, The Trade Desk Promises Big Changes After Missing Its Q4 Guidance (February) The Trade Desk has long been a darling of Wall Street. But when it missed its Q4 guidance at the beginning of this year, investors started to worry not just about The Trade Desk but publicly traded ad tech companies. The earnings miss kicked off a year of change and challenges at The Trade Desk, as it sought to get back on track and push the industry on issues like transparency and labeling resellers. Even so, it ended the year with layoffs. 6. As CTV Blooms, It’s Knives Out For The Trade Desk’s Take Rate (April) The Trade Desk also faced more competition this year. Amazon’s DSP is breaking out beyond its endemic commerce advertisers. And like Google and YouTube, Amazon is paired up with Prime Video, the AVOD-by-default platform brimming with scale and inventory. But that’s not the only CTV DSP in the mix. With a rundown on the competitive landscape of CTV DSPs, this story underlined the challenge of bringing programmatic tech to CTV. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. 7. Meet The Netflix Ads Suite, Introduced By Ads VP Nicolle Pangis (March) After years of rumors, Netflix finally added an ad-supported subscription option. And the CTV industry wanted to know more. When Ads VP Nicolle Pangis appeared at CTV Connect this year, she revealed details about Netflix’s product road map and the product acronym, NAS, that will house the streamer’s ad tech ambitions. 8. Lawmakers Demand Answers From Ad Tech Vendors Allegedly Monetizing CSAM (February) The lack of transparency in ad tech has long meant advertisers buy ads in places where they don’t want them. But putting ads in illegal places, such as on CSAM, moves the conversation of “brand safety” into a different realm. When Adalytics discovered ads placed on illegal content earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to multiple ad tech companies demanding answers. 9. Google Isn’t Launching A User Choice Prompt For Third-Party Cookies In Chrome (April) For years, Google Chrome plotted a replacement to third-party cookies. Then it walked back that decision, validating the long-held industry skepticism around Google actually going through with that plan. Instead, Chrome was going to build its version of Apple ATT, the user choice prompt that asked users if they really, truly wanted cookies. Just kidding. Google wasn’t going to do that, either – a new story that was both a bombshell and the latest industry I-told-you-so. 10. The Ad Context Protocol Aims To Make Sense Of Agentic Ad Demand (October) How will ad tech change once agents enter the scene? It’s possible agents will negotiate campaign deals on behalf of clients. And AdCP, or Ad Context Protocol, is a new protocol that will standardize those interactions. The steady hum of traffic to this article post-publication speaks to the many minds figuring out the future of AI in digital ad transactions.

BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.

Title: Entertainment and Media Layoffs Up 18% With Over 17,000 Jobs Slashed in 2025

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A wave of consolidation, AI-driven change and cost-cutting pushed entertainment and media layoffs sharply higher in 2025 After a slight dip in layoffs in 2024, the entertainment and media industry jobs suffered through another difficult year. In 2025, over 17,000 jobs were cut across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming in the first 11 months of the year. This figure was up 18% from last year, continuing a trend from the past few years as the industry has wrestled with consolidation and other pressures like the double strikes in 2023. News alone, including broadcast, digital and print, suffered 2,254 job cuts to date, 179 of which occurred in November, but for the year, cuts were down 50% from the 4,537 job losses announced during the same period last year. The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation, according to Challenger. This summer the FCC officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, leading to layoffs across the Paramount entertainment business. Disney laid off hundreds this year, as part of CEO Bob Iger’s 2023 initiative to cut costs amid an audience migration away from cable TV subscriptions to streaming platforms. A World Economic Forum survey also found that 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI’s ability to handle more more complicated tasks have led to companies cutting jobs, although the actual return on investment of AI tools has been disappointing. Correspondingly, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. As AI cements itself into everyday life, digital media companies struggle. Sites that relied heavily on SEO and search are having to adapt strategy, leading some to shutter, like Teen Vogue. Layoffs across Condé Nast and Penske-owned properties removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations as a result. And PBS lost federal funding under President Donald Trump, forcing it to cut 15% of its staff. These job losses underscore a more broadly weaker job market, with November seeing more than 71,000 layoffs overall, the second highest over the last five years, behind only the 2022 cuts, according to said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also noted that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from year-end layoff announcements. From 2010 to 2017, the media industry lost 7,305 jobs per year on average, according to Challenger’s data. Since 2018, the average number of annual job cuts has jumped to 14,298. There is one industry in the entertainment business that is growing, though: the creator economy. As other industries shrink, the digital creator industry has only grown in 2025. From 2022 to 2024, L.A. employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, employment in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. The microdramas business has also grown this year, employing Hollywood production crews, nonunion actors and writers to create bite-sized, bingeable episodes that turn a profit. In just four years since the launch of these vertical dramas, the genre’s market has surpassed $8 billion globally, according to Media Partners Asia. Below is a look back at a grisly year that is increasingly becoming the norm for the news and entertainment industries. The entertainment industry suffered thousands of job losses this year as industry consolidation and contraction hit companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. The FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger in July, placing the company under CEO David Ellison’s hands. During the last quarter of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reviewed bids to sell its holdings. It accepted Netflix’s offer, but Paramount has continued to put pressure on the company to accepts its bid. However the bidding war plays out, any deal will result in layoffs, although the timing could stretch into 2027. As Hollywood continues to lose out on productions to the U.K. due to incentives overseas and the rising cost of shooting in Los Angeles, the industry has also taken a hit. Some of the major job cuts to hit Hollywood this year included: Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal are each planning to spinoff their cable linear assets next year. With Comcast’s creation of Versant, NBCU laid off 7% of the workforce at NBC News and more employees from the television sector of the business, with Versant trading at the beginning of 2026. Under the leadership of Gunnar Wiedenfels, Warner Bros. will house its traditional TV networks under the independent “Global Networks” company. This split will go into effect later in 2026 under the accepted Netflix bid. Paramount is still pursuing the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, and said it expects to wring out $6 billion in merger-cost savings over the next three years. Analysts predicted at least 6,000 job losses, echoing Disney’s 2019 Fox acquisition downsizing. On-location production in the greater Los Angeles area, meanwhile, declined 13.2% from July through September compared to the same period last year, according to FilmLA. Only 157 theatrical films, television shows and movies, and streaming projects shot in Los Angeles County were completed and released in 2024. That’s down 14% from the 183 projects recorded in 2023 and the 228 recorded in 2022 amidst the production backlog caused by COVID. While Hollywood remains the leader in global film and TV production, the gap continues to steadily narrow while an estimated 41,000 entertainment jobs in Los Angeles have been lost over the past five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past,” FilmLA Vice President of Communications Philip Sokoloski said. “Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.” With the impending threat and continued implementation of AI in the newsroom, media companies have made tough decisions to best fit their financial needs and maintain relevancy. Several news organizations took hits as they pivot to keep up with audiences shortening attention spans and growing content sources. The cuts came amid a broader wave of layoffs throughout 2025. CBS News laid off about 100 people in October, weeks after NBC News laid off roughly 150 people. Condé Nast also cut multiple staffers last month through layoffs at Teen Vogue and the firings of four staffers who protested the cuts. Penske staffers suffered a wave of cuts at Variety, Rolling Stone and Billboard just weeks before the holidays. The layoffs at PMC organizations also come after the company removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations in October for those who would not comply. There was a distinct rise in AI-driven layoffs this year, with the technology accounting for nearly 55,000 job cuts, according to data from Challenger. Since its introduction, AI has offered to replace workers and perform the jobs of many at a lower cost, vastly changing how employers value their employees and how secure workers feel in their roles. Amazon laid off 14,000 employees in October. CEO Andy Jassy claimed the cuts were not necessarily driven by financial or AI factors though the company’s initial memo to staffers said the company needed to meet “this generation of AI.” Microsoft similarly cut 15,000 jobs throughout the year, providing a variety of explanations for the cuts. Both companies have invested heavily in AI tools. AI’s integration into the newsroom has not been seamless for all — see the Washington Post’s AI-generated news podcast — but media organizations are leaning into the technology as a tool to keep up and compete. New York became the first state to require employers to disclose when AI is the reason for layoffs this year as more companies seek the technology out as a way to increase work efficiency and potentially cut entry level roles. “Currently, AI aids news workers rather than replaces them, but there are no guarantees this will remain the case,” a report from Columbia University’s journalism school said earlier this year. “AI is sufficiently mature to enable the replacement of at least some journalism jobs, either directly or because fewer workers are needed.”
