Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. About 14 months after emerging from Chapter 11, the retailer finds itself in bankruptcy court once again. This time, it’s liquidating. Party City, once a leader in the celebrations space, is going out of business. The company in October 2023 emerged from bankruptcy, shedding nearly $1 billion in debt. Then-CEO Brad Weston commented on the “bright future that lies ahead for PCHI.” After exiting bankruptcy, the company took efforts aimed at creating a more efficient and profitable business, including optimizing its inventory, initiating layoffs, updating its retail pricing methodology and exiting its manufacturing business to instead focus on retail and wholesale. In the 14 months since emerging from bankruptcy, however, Party City was faced with industry-wide challenges, including inflation, a pullback in discretionary spending, shifting consumer preferences and contracting margins, Deborah Rieger-Paganis, Party City chief restructuring officer and AlixPartners managing director, said in court documents Sunday. Party City has faced competition as specialty pop-up stores like Spirit Halloween have expanded and mass merchants like Target and Amazon have increased their party offerings, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. “While Party City previously pulled itself out of bankruptcy the first time around, its continued failure was likely inevitable,” he said by email. “A downswing in demand for party products has continued to put pressure on the business. Much of this is down to two factors: increased competition and a more constrained consumer.” Despite efforts taken by the company to reposition it for long-term growth, sales and store traffic took a significant hit in the last year. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Party City’s comparative store sales fell 9.5%, while sales in its consumer products division declined 24.8%. As of Saturday, the company had about $400 million in debt obligations. The company in September this year sought out ways to raise additional capital, but those efforts came up short, forcing the company to pivot to liquidation. “Like many retailers, we’ve been operating in an immensely challenging environment with inflationary pressures on both costs and consumer spending, and while we did everything we could to navigate these headwinds, our very best efforts were ultimately not enough to overcome these challenges,” Party City wrote in a statement on its website. Rieger-Paganis called the timing of the going-out-of-business sales “unfortunate” ahead of the holidays, but “essential” in order “to capture the benefit for all stakeholders of the Christmas and New Year’s selling seasons.” The company also said that it’s keeping on more than 95% of its 12,000 employees for an unspecified amount of time to help with the wind-down process.

Our annual panel of industry-watchers review their calls for the past year, and offer new forecasts for the year to come Every year, we turn to a panel of trusted analysts to ask them what they see coming down the road, and ask them to assess their predictions from the previous year. This year we've got Niko Partners' Lisa Cosmas Hanson, Midia Research's Rhys Elliott, Kantan Games' Dr. Serkan Toto, Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls and Newzoo's Emmanuel (Manu) Rosier. As always, thanks to all our panelists for taking part in this tradition. Nintendo Switch 2 will take center stage Incorrect. The Nintendo Switch 2 has been prominent in rumor discussions rather than taking center stage officially. End of the live service domination and market saturation Partially correct. While older live service titles continue to dominate, newer entries in the space have seen mixed success, with some achieving short-lived popularity and others failing to gain traction. The industry is not fully transitioning back to premium games, but there is growing acknowledgment that the sheer volume of live service offerings exceeds players' available time. Many players appreciate taking breaks from their 'lifestyle' games to enjoy more finite, complete gaming experiences. Nostalgia takes a key role in live service titles Spot on. As major live service games reach new lifecycle milestones, there's a rising interest in revisiting the origins of these games, with players embracing 'vanilla' versions of their favourites. This mirrors the trend in single-player games with remasters and remakes driven by nostalgia. Xbox's strategic move into mobile Partially correct. Microsoft is ready to launch the Xbox app on Android but cannot until an antitrust ruling in the United States comes into force. "Without groundbreaking innovations, consumers may see little reason to upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2" The onslaught of open-world Souls-like games Incorrect. While expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree for Elden Ring and releases like Black Myth: Wukong have been successful, these do not represent a significant market shift toward open-world Souls-like games. AI in game production Correct. AI is steadily integrating into game development processes, though we have yet to see a revolutionary impact. However, its broader adoption across the industry is inevitable. The evolution of multi-game subscriptions is over True. In 2024, no major breakthroughs occurred in subscription models. The release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass caused premium-to-subscription cannibalization on Xbox, but strong sales on other platforms offset this, leaving trends unclear. Epic Games is doubling down on Fortnite as a platform, adding content like Fortnite Festival and Lego Fortnite to Fortnite Crew subscriptions without raising prices, aiming to lock in players and developers. Mobile-to-PC gaming evolution Incorrect. There has not been a notable shift toward PC ports of mobile games. GTA 6: One game to rule them all Grand Theft Auto 6, scheduled for a fall 2025 release, is poised to reshape the gaming industry – much like its predecessor, GTA 5, which shattered records with 32.5 million units sold in its first year. While the market landscape has evolved, Rockstar's legacy of delivering groundbreaking experiences ensures that GTA 6 will leave a lasting mark. When GTA 5 launched in 2013, it capitalised on the late lifecycle of the PS3 and Xbox 360, leveraging a vast and mature audience. GTA 6, by contrast, will arrive earlier in the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S lifecycle, facing a smaller but rapidly growing install base. However, the enduring success of GTA Online, with millions of active players, has kept the franchise at the forefront of gaming, driving extraordinary anticipation for GTA 6. Rockstar's history of crafting genre-defining titles positions GTA 6 to set new industry standards. Yet, its challenge lies in navigating a gaming world increasingly dominated by live-service titles. How Rockstar adapts the Grand Theft Auto formula to this evolving landscape will not only determine GTA 6's success but may also redefine the future of open-world gaming. Why the Nintendo Switch 2 may struggle to outperform its predecessor The Nintendo Switch 2 faces the challenge of living up to the original Switch's monumental success, even with the appeal of backward compatibility as an upgrade incentive. With over 146 million units sold and helped by the pandemic, the original Switch has deeply penetrated the market, leaving many players satisfied with their current systems. Without groundbreaking innovations, consumers may see little reason to upgrade. Compounding the challenge, a budget-friendly version of the original Switch – if still available – could attract cost-conscious buyers, diverting attention from the new console. "The industry is not fully transitioning back to premium games, but there is growing acknowledgment that the sheer volume of live service offerings exceeds players' available time" To make an impact, the Switch 2 will need exclusive launch titles or games that fully utilize its hardware improvements. Yet, no major exclusives have been announced, leaving questions about how it will differentiate itself. While Nintendo's history suggests it may have surprises in store, surpassing the Switch's unprecedented sales figures seems like a steep climb. Ubisoft: Acquisition, privatisation, or dismantling Ubisoft finds itself at a critical juncture as financial struggles and operational missteps have severely impacted its stability. Its market value has halved in 2024, falling back to levels not seen since 2015. The poor performance of releases such as Star Wars Outlaws, XDefiant, and Rainbow Six Extraction, combined with delays of key franchises like Assassin's Creed Shadows, have exacerbated the company's challenges, leaving investors and fans increasingly disillusioned and calling for substantial change. Acquisition or privatisation appears increasingly likely. Tencent, a major shareholder in Ubisoft, is a leading candidate for a buyout, though its future M&A strategy remains unclear. Privatisation could shield Ubisoft from the pressures of the public market, offering a chance for a comprehensive strategic overhaul. However, both paths risk partial or complete dismantling, as new ownership may choose to streamline operations by selling underperforming studios or non-core assets. Fortnite's next level: Taking on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox Fortnite is rapidly evolving from a popular game into a major digital distribution platform, poised to challenge established giants like Steam and PlayStation Store. Recent developments underscore its growing influence across gaming and entertainment. On November 30, 2024, Fortnite set a new standard for in-game events with 'Remix: The Finale,' a concert featuring performances by Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and a tribute to Juice WRLD. The event attracted over 14 million concurrent players and demonstrated the platform's unparalleled ability to draw massive audiences and create cultural moments within its ecosystem. Epic Games continues to innovate by making user-generated content more accessible. Introducing unique deep links for Fortnite islands allows players to seamlessly join specific experiences directly from a shared URL. Currently available on PC and Android, this feature simplifies content discovery and enhances player engagement. Looking ahead to 2025, Fortnite could potentially strengthen its position by advancing creator tools, fostering new strategic alliances, and promoting open digital marketplaces. These efforts could signal its ambition to rival established digital distribution platforms, reshaping the industry and expanding its influence as a digital powerhouse. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs, power of forever-titles, and Sony's huge lead leave Xbox no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early" Weakening of large live-service titles outside of Fortnite and Minecraft Several factors are influencing the market landscape. As noted earlier, Fortnite continues to expand its growth and maintain its dominance. Meanwhile, Roblox is experiencing growth not only on mobile platforms but also on PC and consoles. On the other hand, some games are facing challenges in attracting new players. For competitive games like MOBAs, high skill barriers can deter newcomers, while in other cases, expansive storylines and increasingly complex mechanics may discourage players from starting. Additionally, 2025 is shaping up to be a standout year for new game releases. This influx of fresh titles will likely divert time and engagement away from many existing live-service games. In summary, 2025 appears to be ushering in a convergence of trends that could pose significant challenges for many traditional live-service titles. We will not see a successful new F2P multiplayer shooter launch in 2025 Looking over the past few years of shooter launches, it is increasingly plain to see that the genre is beyond saturated and that players are fixed to their franchise shooter of choice. While there may be blips on the radar that may ping every time a new one launches and players check the game out, these will ultimately fizzle out over the next year to two years without any additional fanfare. "Switch 2" will come and be $400 Incorrect. I am probably off by three to six months (Switch 2 is likely to arrive in the first half of 2025) but still believe in the other points I made, including the price point – despite potential US tariffs. Saudi Arabia will make more big moves Incorrect. But they publicly announced they will make a big move (a billion dollar acquisition) in 2025 earlier this year. AI will become an even bigger topic in 2024 Correct, and we will of course see a lot more next year. Square Enix will release a big IP game with crypto elements Incorrect. Xbox will open all floodgates and go all-in on PS5 I am aware that Microsoft has already become somewhat open to releasing Xbox games on other platforms, but 2025 might be the year where they go all-in. The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark. "Ubisoft at the end of 2025 will look a lot different from now" Instant gaming will have its big moment Instant gaming silently amassed vast audiences over time, but I believe 2025 will be the true breakout year in the West. The idea of not having to install apps and being able to play across various platforms with deep social hooks led to hundreds of millions of active players on WeChat in China, for example. Apple just a few weeks ago enabled in-app-purchases for instant games on iOS, a watershed moment this part of the industry has been waiting for for years. Ubisoft will change radically I hope I am wrong on this one, but I see Ubisoft closing studios and cutting stuff at a significantly larger scale next year. In my view, Assassin's Creed Shadows will get solid reviews and sell 'okay' – but not enough to make Ubisoft continue business as usual. Ubisoft at the end of 2025 will look a lot different from now. Nintendo will not have enough consoles to sell Despite Nintendo's pledge and best efforts, the new device will sell out very quickly and not be available for months in 2025. It will be even worse than 2017 when the Switch launched. Furthermore, the name will be Switch 2. I also expect deep price cuts for the original Switch in 2025. AI to supercharge games development Correct. Over 17,000 games were published on Steam, compared to around 14,000 last year. AI is also being more prominently used. For example, at EA’s annual ‘Investor Day’ in September 2024, CEO Andrew Wilson, said that AI is "at the very core of the business” and has more than "100 active novel AI projects” in development. Games subscription growth to outpace games software growth by three times Correct. At the time of writing, preliminary MIDiA forecasts suggest that by the end of 2024, subscription revenue will have grown by approximately 15% while games purchase revenue will have actually declined. Another $100 million-plus acquisition will take place Correct. Take-Two Interactive bought Gearbox Interactive for $460 million. Beacon Interactive bought Saber Interactive for $237 million. Turtle Beach bought Fortnite Festival guitar maker PDP for $118 million. Games and social media will eat into time on other formats Partially Correct. While time spent on games and social media grew by 5% and 12%, respectively, between Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, games decreased their share of entertainment time slightly, while social media grew slightly. Non-game companies will deepen their involvement with games Correct. Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games to bring Disney brands into Fortnite. YouTube Playables, free games playable on YouTube, left soft launch. LinkedIn introduced New York Times-like games. Following massive success with its Fallout TV series, Amazon announced it is making a Mass Effect show. Games and social media will eat into time on other formats. Ads revenue will become more prominent on PC and console After an extended period of strong growth, the games market has begun to face growth challenges. Some game makers will turn to advertising – which has largely been untapped on console and PC – to drive growth. Advertising will become more prominent at platform level (Xbox and PlayStation menus) and at game level (immersive, interstitial, and rewarded alike). What is more, mobile developers are increasingly entering console and PC (and will bring mobile ad monetisation learnings with them). While game developers have experimented with advertising in the past, the revenue stream is more viable now as programmatic advertising means ads are more automated and specific. Gaming is now at the front of mind for marketers and there is also a necessity: the games market and advertisers alike need new revenue streams. "Advertising will become more prominent at platform level and at game level... The games market and advertisers alike need new revenue streams" Portable gaming skyrockets Nintendo will release its Switch 2 in 2025, and we should expect to see a new Mario Kart and a Super Mario title during the launch window. This console will sell well, driving game-related hardware and console revenues in 2025. However, this is just the beginning for portable gaming’s oncoming tailwind. The attention economy is oversaturated, and Nintendo was shrewd to release a hybrid handheld that allows both at-home play on the TV and portable play. Similarly, companion portables like the Steam Deck complement a gamer’s main platform (a gaming PC, in this case). Companion portables give players more opportunities to engage with their ecosystem of choice, and more opportunities for games to grow their share of the attention economy. Microsoft’s CEO of gaming Phil Spencer confirmed Xbox is working on a portable, and leaks reported by Bloomberg indicate Sony is as well. A portable strategy would also fit in with both companies’ current strategies and recent peripheral releases/partnerships, such as the PlayStation Portal (a companion device letting players stream their PS5 remotely to the Portal’s screen via WiFi) and Xbox’s play anywhere initiatives and partnership with the ASUS ROG Ally portable PC. The year of the portable is coming. Multi-game subscriptions growth will take a back seat Unlike video and music, game subscriptions will not be the sole future of distribution any time soon – but they will have their place. While a consumer can listen to hundreds of tracks and watch dozens of movies or TV episodes in a month, the majority only have time to play a few games. That is why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players. Most gamers are already served by the free-to-play markets – or are happy enough to buy a few games a year à la carte. Free-based tiers and cloud gaming could change this in the long term, but for the coming years, subscriptions will remain a secondary revenue stream for the games market. Generative AI will divide game leadership and game makers Generative AI will undoubtedly have a bigger role in game development going forward, but the transition to this new technology will face struggles in 2025. While game publishers will continue to inject generative AI to cut costs and streamline game creation, the technology will continue to worry game developers. "The year of the portable is coming" Generative AI is relatively new and more use cases will hit the market in 2025, leading to yet more debate. More developers will publicly decry generative AI and will mobilise fans of their games to do the same. Inevitably, a high-profile game will use "no AI was used in the making of this game" as a marketing bullet point. Creator-led games will start to show their worth Creators and influencers that got rich through gaming video content have their eyes – and their capital – on game development. For example, popular YouTuber Videogamedunkey already owns his own indie publisher, Bigmode. Meanwhile, several influencer-led game studios are creating game experiences on Epic Games’ Unreal Engine for Fortnite (such as Typical Gamer with his own studio JOGO). These creators are using their audiences (marketing), networks (B2B), and knowledge of games to cater to their audiences and gain momentum in the market. In 2025, we expect to see a viral hit from one of these influencer-led publishers – or at least a game becomes part of the gaming cultural zeitgeist. Asia & MENA to account for over 60% of global PC & Mobile games revenue Almost correct. Asia & MENA will generate $82 billion in player spending across PC & Mobile in 2024, which is roughly 56% of global PC & Mobile game revenue. A deal valued at more than $2.5 billion (among the Top Ten of all time) will happen Correct, but not from Asia. EQT acquired Keywords Studios for nearly $2.4 billion in 2024. EQT is not from Asia, however. Instant games will reach over one billion MAUs in Asia & MENA Correct. We believe this prediction was achieved with 800m MAUs for mini /instant games coming from WeChat and Douyin in China alone. New console hardware will be announced in 2024 Correct. While the Nintendo Switch successor was not announced, as we previously expected, Sony announced its PS5 Pro and multiple PC gaming handhelds were also announced. The new global esports landscape will be centered outside of the west Correct. There were more high-profile esports tournaments and viewership in Asia & MENA compared to the west this year by a growing margin. "In 2025, additional markets will require Apple and Google to remove their walled gardens" Blizzard will re-enter China in an official capacity Correct. Blizzard announced its return in April 2024 and re-established its partnership with NetEase More than 100 import games will be granted an ISBN for release in China Probably correct, but not yet confirmed. 98 Import Games have been approved as of writing (December 16), and we could see another batch before the end of the year taking the number over 100. Governments in Southeast Asia & India will actively support games industry growth Correct. Multiple governments in the region announced policies that include support for video games and esports in their respective markets. Indonesia, Malaysia, India, to name a few. The following predictions pertain to the primary markets that Niko Partners analyzes every day – i.e. those in Asia and MENA. These are a subset of predictions and topics that our team of analysts is considering about 2025 and beyond to help guide our clients in their global business strategic planning. China’s video game market revenue will reach $50 billion Niko Partners proprietary market model forecasts that player spending on video game software and services will surpass $50 billion in China next year – making it the first country to do so. While China is a mobile-first market, with over two-thirds of spend from smartphones and tablets, we continue to see notable growth from the PC and console game segments, especially on the heels of the successful launch of Black Myth: Wukong. China won’t be the only market to achieve a milestone in 2025. India is set to exceed $1 billion in player spending, the Philippines will reach $500 million, and Thailand will closely approach $2 billion. In fact, the Asia & MENA region as a whole will reach $89 billion in player spending across PC, mobile, and console, with a user base of 1.76 billion gamers. 2025 will be better than 2024 for the games markets in Asia & MENA The global video games industry has experienced significant fluctuations during the post-pandemic period, and Asia & MENA are not exceptions to this. However, while layoffs continue along with global economic uncertainty, we see 2025 (particularly after Q1) as a more stable year for the industry compared with 2024. India’s games revenue will grow 14.7% YoY in 2025, followed by MENA-3 (8.3% YoY) and Southeast Asia (6.1% YoY). However, Japan and Korea likely will not see positive growth rates until 2026. In emerging markets like India, MENA, and Southeast Asia, new gamers and a growing middle class will drive increased spending on video games. We also expect to see companies that significantly downsized their gaming operations, such as ByteDance and Garena, indicate recovery by greenlighting new titles and other gaming related projects. "We forecast that player spending on games will surpass $50 billion in China next year – making it the first country to do so" Over 1 billion gamers in Asia & MENA will watch gaming & esports content online Niko Partners conducts an annual online survey of 7,500 gamers across Asia & MENA to understand gamer behavior, motivations and insights across the region. One important stat that we’ve paid attention to recently is the increasing number of gamers that watch gaming and esports related video content online. In 2024, we found that just over half of all gamers surveyed watch gaming and esports content online. In 2025, we expect this to increase to nearly 60% as publishers and content creators fuel demand for video content. Southeast Asia and India already index higher than China, East Asia, and MENA, which typically fall slightly below 50%. Game video and livestreaming continues to play a greater role in the region for game discovery, marketing, and even distribution. One notable trend we’ve seen recently is the sale of in-game content via livestreams, with viewers able to make purchases without leaving the stream. Game companies will shift back to geographic expansion Niko Partners believes game companies will recognize growth through geographic expansion in 2025, after new technologies such as Web3, VR/AR/XR, and cloud gaming underperformed expectations. We anticipate firms will double down on international expansion particularly to Asia and MENA, given the growing appetite for gaming and the recent success of global IP in these markets. In 2024, Korean game Dungeon & Fighter launched in China and grossed over $2 billion. Likewise, Supercell’s Brawl Stars has recently seen South Korea, Japan, and China emerge as its Top Three markets outside the US. Geographic expansion not only diversifies a company’s player base but also mitigates the risk associated with untested new technologies, ultimately driving sustainable growth in a more predictable and stable market environment. New regulations will further open up walled gardens on mobile The past few years has seen the US, EU, Japan, South Korea, and India take antitrust action against walled gardens on mobile, primarily operated by Apple and Google. This has led to Apple and Google allowing third party app stores, alternative payment systems, and removing anti-steering provisions in certain countries. However, stakeholders and regulators continue to argue that Apple and Google are not in compliance with these rulings, and regulators in other countries have also started to take an interest in opening up digital markets after pressure from the industry. In 2025, we fully expect that additional markets will announce rulings that require Apple and Google to remove their walled gardens, and we believe that both parties will be required to remove their commission fee in at least one market when developers link out to an external web shop. We expect this to accelerate out-of-app monetization growth, benefiting game developers who will be able to earn higher gross margins on in-game payments. Not at the end of the industry layoffs Correct, unfortunately Market growth in low single digits Looks to be correct. We’re currently forecasting 1.4% growth Switch 2 release at end of the year, PS5 the best-selling console, VR to have another tough year Wrong, right, right Use of generative AI-driven NPCs Wrong. Hasn’t really happened (although plenty of tech demos!) Microsoft to challenge EA to become the biggest publisher across Xbox and PlayStation, Activision Blizzard new releases to go into Game Pass, Cheaper Game Pass with mobile content Right, Right, Wrong Mobile app store status quo to continue Right. However see below for thoughts on increasing off-platform disruption Microsoft to experiment with a mobile app store Wrong. Launch has been delayed Netflix to broaden its game streaming offer to more countries Correct MMO resurgence, uptick in games IP adaptations, more AA games from biggest publishers, GTA 6 launch date late in 2025 Generally, right. MMO resurgence hasn’t really happened although peak WoW’s player numbers in 2024 were the highest for several years. It’s been a really tough year for the industry. Slower market growth and rising costs combined with the devastating number of layoffs has created a tense and difficult operating environment. It’s likely that backdrop will continue into 2025 to an extent, though I don’t think we’ll see the same level of industry contraction and job losses. Overall market performance in 2025 I’m expecting continued slow growth in games content and services spend globally. Gone are the years of 10-15% market growth driven by huge increases in mobile gaming spend. With that fuel seemingly burned for at least the next few years, the market is in a slow growth era. However, to put this in a more positive context, total global market size is expected to be similar to historical market peak from 2021 where consumption was heavily driven by the impact of the pandemic. The console market is set to grow marginally with Switch 2 launch (currently expected it to arrive in Q2 at minimum $400/€400) and GTA 6 releasing. US import tariffs are a dark cloud on the horizon, but I’m going to positively predict that console hardware is once again made exempt from these import charges. GTA 6 will be the largest entertainment release of all time in terms of revenue generated in its launch months. Such is the size of a new GTA, if it is delayed into 2026, the console market performance will probably be down even without the potential impact of tariffs. GTA Online will continue for gamers that play on PS4, Xbox One and PC, meaning a fractured GTA userbase for Rockstar to deal with. If Switch 2 hits in Q2 (one to three months later in the year than the original Switch did), I’m forecasting sell-through of a little north of 13 million units. That’s a sales rate higher than the original Switch. I’m interested to see what Nintendo does with Nintendo Switch Online at launch. I’d like to think it will expand its content and feature set for the launch of the Switch 2. "GTA 6 will be the largest entertainment release of all time... If it is delayed into 2026, the console market performance will probably be down" Off-platform app monetisation There’s been a lot of talk about the potential for mobile app store disruption with the introduction of more third-party stores from the likes of Epic and Microsoft to compete with the incumbents following various legal ruling across different countries and regions. While this is interesting to track, shifting consumer behaviour around game discovery is challenging so I’m not expecting major changes in 2025 even if Microsoft does get around to launching its mobile app store. After all, there have been alternative app stores on Android devices for many years and, in the PC space, Epic has thrown large amounts of investment behind competing with Steam through Epic Games Store. Neither of these factors has altered the status quo in terms of consumer behaviour significantly. However, beyond new app stores offering a collection of games, the practice of driving high-spending gamers off-platform to monetise directly through publisher-specific web stores is something we’ll see a lot more of in 2025. This could drive increased profits for mobile games companies and will drive a bigger share of spending outside the App Store and Google Play than we’ve seen previously. Funding and M&A activity picking up I’m expecting funding and M&A activity to increase in 2025 compared to 2024 as investment appetite returns. A lot of recent funding has focused on the games production value chain and games technology, with less investment in developers and publishers. That trend will continue, but I expect the investment pipeline to return to games content-based companies progressively through the year. What will happen with Ubisoft? I think it depends on the performance of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to an extent. A strong performance could change the leverage different parties have in discussions to take the company private, which may delay any change in the company’s position. Content trends I think we’ll see a deeper focus on remakes and sequels as publishers stay risk averse when it comes to investment. A new wave of extractions shooters is expected in 2025, but I don’t think there is enough demand to support multiple new entrants. Unfortunately, that will result in some big budget failures. Publishers will continue to aggressively look at ways to drive more value from their existing games IP and franchises. That means more cross-game licensing, brand partnerships, cross-media licensing, sponsorship, and advertising in and around their games. "Total global market size in 2025 is expected to be similar to the historical market peak from 2021" Web3 games will probably have a decent resurgence due to coin prices, so expect to see more releases and investment again in this area. Black Myth: Wukong’s success will prompt more investment into these sort of single player games and will drive all Chinese publishers and developers to consider the global appeal of their upcoming games. Unexpected twists and turns There are things that are inherently hard to predict, such as Payday being deeply integrated into PUBG, which seems like an off-the-wall collaboration. I think the hunt for engagement and player attention, and the difficult market backdrop will mean more unexpected collaborations and partnerships, where companies are pushed to get more creative and ambitious to carve out a space in the market.

Change doesn’t always happen overnight… sometimes it takes an entire year. And you don’t have to be an expert reader of tea leaves to recognize that 2024 has been a pivot point for TV news. The steady accumulation of resignations, promotions, job changes, and corporate reorgs—as well as a few notable passings of celebrated journalists—over the past 12 months confirm that a very different landscape awaits the industry beyond that proverbial revolving door in 2025. To kick off the last full week of 2024, TVNewser looks back on some of the biggest departures, career relaunches, and shake-ups of this calendar year—and how they contributed to the larger climate of change around TV news.

Title: The Top 10 Book Business News Stories of 2024 [Publishers Weekly]

1. The Distribution Sector Dealt with Disorder Shrinking distribution options created an ever-more challenging landscape, especially for independent publishers, throughout the year. The situation has become serious enough for indie publishers that the heads of various associations and smaller presses are working on various plans to offer indie presses more distribution options. The challenging distribution landscape took center stage in March, when Small Press Distribution abruptly shut down after struggling for years to remain a viable distributor for small, and mainly literary, presses. Earlier in the year, in an effort to modernize SPD’s nonprofit operations, its executive director, Kent Watson, moved to outsource the actual warehousing and distribution of clients’ books to Ingram Content Group and Publishers Storage and Shipping in hopes of upgrading the services it could provide. But facing a combination of a decline in grants, slow sales, and the cost of moving warehouses, SPD fell into too deep a financial hole. The company filed for dissolution shortly after. The bulk of SPD’s clients were small, and drew little interest from the more established distributors, many of which are now part of large trade publishers. A few smaller companies, such as Asterism, moved to fill the void, and while many presses found new homes, they incurred extra costs nonetheless. In November, National Book Network—which, with about 150 clients, was one of the few remaining larger independent distributors—announced that it too would close, offering its publishers the chance to move to Simon & Schuster Distribution Services before it ceased operations in 2025. In a letter to clients explaining the decision, NBN executives wrote that, with large publishers and Ingram Publisher Services now dominating distribution, “smaller players such as NBN find it difficult to match the economies of scale that the big boys enjoy just by virtue of their size.” 2. The Influence of AI Exploded, for Better and Worse The implications of the impact of generative artificial intelligence on numerous publishing practices—from administrative tasks to content creation—simmered throughout the year. At the annual meeting of the Association of American Publishers, CEO Maria Pallante called the current period “the most complex time in the history of publishing.” She said that the principal challenge facing the publishing community at present is to advocate for new laws and policies that can protect copyright industries as changes in technology move at a rapid pace. At the same time, publishing leaders acknowledged that, in the words of Authors Guild CEO Mary Rasenberger, the industry “can’t bury our heads in the sand. AI is here to stay.” Rasenberger made her comments following the November disclosure that HarperCollins had signed a three-year licensing agreement with a large tech company, reported to be Microsoft. Under the opt-in agreement, the company would pay HC $5,000 apiece for any nonfiction book that it used to train its large language models, to be split between HC and authors. While HC is the first trade publisher to sign such an AI agreement, academic and professional publishers including Taylor & Francis and Wiley had previously reached deals of their own, with Wiley signing two agreements worth a total of $44 million. Meanwhile, copyright lawsuits filed against various tech companies continued to work their way through the courts in 2024, and the Authors Guild filed a new lawsuit accusing AI startup Anthropic of copyright infringement for allegedly training its AI tools on books without authorization. In an effort to alleviate the need for lawsuits, a number of startups were launched this year, including Created By Humans, a company launched by Scribd cofounder Trip Adler. The company, which has since partnered with the Authors Guild, aims to serve as a bridge between creators and tech companies interested in licensing rights to use in training their large language models. 3. Book Publishing’s Freedom to Read Efforts In the teeth of a years-long political attack targeting libraries and the freedom to read, publishers have stepped up with several legal actions, and in 2024 those actions yielded some positive results. In January, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision to block key provisions of HB 900, Texas’s controversial book rating law, agreeing with plaintiff publishers and booksellers that the law—which would have required vendors to rate every book sold for sexual content or be banned from doing business with Texas schools—likely violated the First Amendment. In August, the Eighth Circuit delivered a mixed decision, vacating an injunction in a publisher-led lawsuit over Iowa’s book banning law SF 496, but at the same time rejecting the state’s core argument: that decisions about library books are “government speech” and thus not subject to First Amendment scrutiny. And in Florida, a federal judge allowed a lawsuit led by Penguin Random House over book bans in Escambia County to proceed, expressing skepticism over the county's government speech argument. At a pre-trial conference in December, judge T. Kent Wetherell, a Trump appointee, urged county officials to settle the case. Still, there is plenty more freedom to read drama on tap in 2025. As of this writing, the Fifth Circuit is once again considering the government speech argument via a closely-watched book banning case in rural Llano County, Tex., in which county officials have argued that the Fifth Circuit should reverse its own decades-old holding in Campbell v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, a 1995 decision that has long served as an anti-censorship bulwark for librarians. And in Florida, six major publishers have filed a major challenge to two provisions of the state’s “harmful to minors” law, HB 1069, arguing that the law’s unconstitutionally vague language has led to thousands of books—including many classics—being pulled from classroom and school libraries. Meanwhile, in a significant move, Penguin Random House—by far the publisher most active in taking up the freedom to read battle—hired a new senior level policy manager to help fight book bans, a sign that the publisher is interested in getting more upstream in the political and legislative battles over books, rather than having to sue later. 4. Protests over War in Palestine Roiled PEN America The deep political divisions in the country led to the cancellation of the PEN America Literary Awards this year, as well as the organization’s World Voices Festival. The cancellation of the awards ceremony followed months of steadily mounting criticism of PEN America over its response to Israel’s war in Gaza that culminated in 28 authors withdrawing books from consideration for the awards, including nine of the 10 authors nominated for the organization's top prize, the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award. The cancellation of what would have been the 20th edition of the World Voices Festival followed the same lines: criticism of PEN’s response to the crisis in Gaza led to widespread withdrawals by authors who were set to attend the event. As 2024 drew to a close, PEN announced that Suzanne Nossel, who had led the nonprofit for more than a decade and was the focus of much of the criticism of the organization, was stepping down as CEO, and would take the helm of the human rights nonprofit Freedom House on January 7. Chief program officers Summer Lopez and Clarissa Rosaz Shariyf are serving as interim co-CEOs as the free speech organization conducts a nationwide search for its next leader. 5. Hachette Book Group Changed Shape, with Some Growing Pains Penguin Random House and HarperCollins began extensive reorganization efforts in 2023, as did Hachette Book Group, which initiated its own wide-ranging restructuring program beginning with the move last November by parent company Hachette Livre to bring the Hachette Book Group and its U.K.-based counterpart, Hachette UK, under “a new English-language management structure,” with UK CEO David Shelley taking the helm for both companies. In 2024, HBG continued an extensive restructuring that lasted into late summer. A centerpiece of the restructuring was the further integration of Workman Publishing, which HBG had acquired in 2021 and agreed, as part of the deal, to keep all Workman employees for three years. As part of the reorganization, which involved layoffs in the Workman division, Algonquin Books was moved into Little, Brown, reporting to newly appointed president and publisher Sally Kim. Algonquin Young Readers was likewise moved into Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, where it was placed under president and publisher Megan Tingley. The Hachette Books and Hachette Go imprints were also dissolved as part of the restructuring. Workman Publishing Group EVP and publisher Susan Weinberg is set to retire at the end of 2024, and Kristin Kiser, SVP and publisher of the Running Press Group, will become president and publisher of a new division, called the Workman Running Press Group, effective January 1. Sources explained that the makeover of HBG was designed to promote “key team members” and add “extra roles” in “areas where the market is strong” while "cutting back in areas where the market has weakened.” HBG ended the year with a reaffirmation of its commitment to the American trade publishing business when it acquired Union Square Publishing from Barnes & Noble. Under the purchase, all staff, publishing assets, and trademarks of Union Square Publishing, formerly Sterling Publishing Co., were transferred to HBG. 6. Consolidation Continued, and Job Loss With It HBG’s purchase of Union Square was just one of the many acquisitions that have consolidated the publishing industry over the decades. A PW analysis of government statistics found that the number of people employed in book publishing in the U.S. fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. In addition to consolidation—and prior to the rise of AI—new technology has helped to make publishing more efficient than it was during its period of peak employment. These new technologies, along with the retooling the industry underwent following the Great Recession of 2007–2009, are among the major factors in the business’s shrinking workforce. Still, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down, given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have, albeit modestly, continued to tick up. 7. Spotify Shook Up the Audiobook Market Spotify entered the U.S. audiobook market in November 2023, offering more than 200,000 audiobook titles at launch, and its presence had a big effect on sales of the format in 2024. Under Spotify’s model, premium paid subscribers are allotted 15 hours per month to access digital audiobooks, with users able to pay $10.99 to “top off" their time with 10-hour blocks if they wish to keep listening. In the spring, Spotify added a new audiobook subscription tier, dubbed the Audiobooks Access Tier, offering a slightly less expensive but more limited option for users interested in streaming audiobooks on the platform. Industry executives have credited Spotify’s entrance with helping to keep the long-running audiobook sales boom moving forward in 2024. According to the AAP’s StatShot program, sales of audiobooks were up 27% in the first nine months of 2024 over the comparable period a year ago, with digital audio sales at reporting publishers topping sales of e-books. Though it hasn’t released sales figures, in April, Spotify published data suggesting that audiobooks are proving successful in terms of attracting listeners: since launching its audiobooks program last fall, the company said, one quarter of Spotify Premium users had "engaged" with audiobooks. The company has 602 million monthly active users worldwide, 236 million of which are paying subscribers, but it does not offer specific data for the U.S. market. In addition to delivering new customers and new sales of its own, Spotify is also credited by industry insiders with forcing Audible to increase its marketing support for audiobooks. More than one attendee at the Frankfurt Book Fair commented on the size of the Audible stand at this year’s event, and an even more important sign as to how seriously Audible and its corporate parent, Amazon, are taking the Spotify challenge came in November, when Amazon Music Unlimited made it possible for users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada to listen to one audiobook per month from Audible's catalog for free. 8. Major Shifts Hit North American Bookstore Chains North America’s two largest bookstore chains headed in different directions in 2024. Under the direction of James Daunt and backed by its owner, private equity firm Elliott Advisors, Barnes & Noble embarked on its most aggressive store opening program in many years. The retailer opened about 30 outlets in 2023 and, after initially planning to open 50 stores in 2024, Daunt raised his target number to 60 in early November, noting that strong sales at B&N’s existing outlets encouraged him to be more aggressive in 2024. (B&N began 2024 with 609; it is not yet clear what its final number of stores will be at the end of 2024, once store closings are factored in.) In another sign of the health of the retailer, B&N acquired the Tattered Cover, the 53-year-old Denver bookstore chain known for its staunch defense of the freedom to read, for $1.83 million in June. Tattered Cover retained a majority of its 70 employees across its four Colorado locations along with its name and branding, in keeping with a strategy Daunt has followed when acquiring such venerable U.K. brands as Blackwell’s, Hatchards, Foyles, and Hodges Figgis. Despite its successes, B&N did suffer one major loss this year, when Len Riggio, who revolutionized the bookselling business—first by making B&N the dominant bookstore chain in the U.S. and then by opening hundreds of superstores—died on August 27 at age 83. While B&N grew in 2024, Indigo Books & Music, Canada’s largest bookseller, underwent a retrenching. In May, a group of investors led by Canadian billionaire Gerald Schwartz, an Indigo board member and the husband of Indigo founder and CEO Heather Reisman, acquired the company and returned it to private control. The acquisition followed an extraordinarily difficult few years for the retailer, beginning with declining sales through its physical bookstores during the pandemic and a cyberattack that crippled its e-book sales. Indigo's sales slump continued through the final quarter of 2023, when revenue dropped 12%, and its net income in the period fell to C$10 million, from C$34.3 million in the last quarter of 2022. 9. Religion Book Sales Have a Stellar Showing While trade sales in general have struggled to reach the highs of the early pandemic years, one category has done very well: religion books. According to the AAP, sales of religion books rose 7% in 2023, easily beating the 0.8% decline in overall sales. Sales stayed strong in 2024 and were up 18.5% through October, with Bibles as the main engine drivers, according to executives in the sector. Doug Lockhart, SVP of sales and marketing for HarperCollins Christian Publishing, told PW that he was not surprised by the Bible bump: "There's a lot of angst in the world today, and people are looking for answers." The sales momentum in the religion category was strong enough to convince PRH, in October, to launch the Penguin Random House Christian Publishing Group, a new standalone entity that will expand and build upon on the publisher’s existing evangelical Christian publishing programs. According to the announcement, the expansion involves several personnel moves and additional resources devoted to the company's Waterbrook & Multnomah, Image, and Forum imprints. The group is being led by Campbell Wharton, who has been promoted to SVP. 10. Traditional Publishing Heavyweights Went Hybrid The challenges facing traditional publishing in the post-pandemic years has led more and more industry insiders to try their hand at nontraditional methods of putting out books. While hybrid publishing has been around for years, it received a jolt of media attention in March, with the formation of Authors Equity. The company was cofounded by former PRH US CEO Madeline McIntosh, who serves as its CEO, with Nina von Moltke, the previous president and director of strategic development at PRH US, as its president, and Don Weisberg, the former CEO of Macmillan, as senior advisor. Among the company’s initial financial backers were five authors, including James Clear, Louise Penny, and Tim Ferriss. Like other hybrid publishers, Authors Equity offers no advances, but pays authors a higher percentage of a book’s profits than the percentages offered in traditional contracts used by the large publishers. In addition to giving authors the chance to earn more money—while relieving the publisher of paying upfront advances—another difference the company’s founders cited from traditional houses was a commitment to “long-term collaboration" with authors and plans to give books the time and attention to find an audience. Along those lines, the publisher pledged to offer its authors “flexibility” and “transparency” in the publishing process, making decisions jointly in the best interests of each book. “We’re in it from day one," the founders promised, "and for the long haul."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At the end of 2022, Spotify (SPOT) stock was trading below $80 a share after a disastrous year for investors that erased over $35 billion from the company's market cap. Today, shares are trading at just under $500. The audio giant is on track to hit full-year profitability for the first time ever. And its market cap? About $100 billion, up from just $15 billion two years ago. The company's colossal run-up in stock price follows an intense business overhaul that's included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts, an area it had aggressively pursued. At the company's 2022 Investor Day, Spotify set seemingly lofty objectives that included long-term gross margin targets between 30% and 35%. At the time, the company had been struggling to turn a profit, with its gross margin stuck at around 25%. In the most recent quarter, Spotify said its gross margin increased to 31.1% from the prior year's 26.4%. "We've never been in a stronger position, thanks to what's really been an outstanding execution by the Spotify team," CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fiscal third quarter earnings call in November. He added, "We are where we set out to be, if not a little bit further, and on a steady path toward achieving our long-term goals." Wall Street analysts who cover Spotify have a median price target of just around $486 a share with 29 Buy ratings, eight Holds, and just three Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. Spotify, one of the stock market's big pandemic-era trades, saw shares balloon in early 2021 as the company sought to broaden its business from music streaming to other areas of the audio market. At the time, the company's endeavors echoed moves from other tech giants in pursuit of that goal. Think heavy spending on hiring and deep-pocketed investments in growth initiatives. For Spotify, that was podcasts. Between 2019 and 2021, Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market, signing on celebrities like the Obamas, Prince Harry, and Kim Kardashian. The company paid $230 million to acquire podcast studio Gimlet in 2019. Spotify then paid a reported $200 million to bring Joe Rogan exclusively to the platform, and another $200 million for the Ringer in 2020. But the spending era was short-lived as investors and analysts began to focus on the company's lack of profitability and cash flow issues, questioning the staying power of the business model and the credibility of CEO Daniel Ek. It's hard to make money in the audio streaming business, largely due to the sky-high price of content. And compared to its main competitors — deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) — Spotify has had an even tougher time absorbing those costs. At the same time, companies in the space have to invest to expand their offerings to win market share. At Spotify, not only was spending aggressive, but a soft advertising market further crimped profit margins. Management attempted to assuage fears with promises that 2022 was a peak investment year and that profitability metrics would begin to improve in 2023. Skepticism still rang high. "Heading into 2023, investors looked at their targets and thought they were very overly ambitious," Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne told Yahoo Finance in an interview. "It really wasn't until they started to see the company make some proactive moves to drive both top-line growth, but also improve the profits of the company, that investors started to come back to the stock." Turnaround efforts first began in early 2023 as the company reorganized and consolidated business units. It adjusted its podcast strategy to focus more on reaching bigger audiences as opposed to maintaining exclusive content. It also changed up its royalty structure to combat streaming fraud and curb the massive volume of music on the platform, which has escalated as a result of generative AI. But the changes picked up steam over the course of last year, culminating in the fourth quarter when "two really important things happened as it relates to the stock performance," Swinburne said. No. 1, in Swinburne's view, was price increases. Spotify implemented a broad set of price hikes across roughly 70% of its footprint by revenue in mid-2023. The hikes were "much larger and broader than they'd ever done before as a company," the analyst said. Second: massive cost-cutting. The company laid off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, in December 2023. This followed a combined 800 employees who were laid off earlier in the year as a result of several restructurings. At the time, the significant reduction in headcount was estimated to lead to approximately 300 million euros ($315 million) in annualized cost savings for fiscal year 2024. "I don't know if I've ever seen a company take that aggressive of cost action while their revenue growth was accelerating, but it was happening at the same time the price increases were being put into place," Swinburne said. "So you had this dual effect of faster revenue growth combined with reduced expenses, which really set the company up into 2024 with a rapidly improving profit profile." Soon after the December layoffs, Spotify also announced that its CFO Paul Vogel would step down from his position after eight years. Vogel, who joined Spotify in 2016 as head of investor relations before taking over the CFO role in 2020, exited his position on March 31. Christian Luiga has since stepped into the role. The efforts didn't stop there. This year, Spotify has doubled down on another growth area with massive potential: audiobooks. "The audiobooks launch is much bigger than audiobooks," Swinburne explained. "It's really about transitioning Spotify from a music-only service to a bundle." The company introduced a higher-priced audio "bundle" that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It also rolled out an audiobooks-only plan and a music-only streaming tier in an effort to cater to a variety of consumers. The changes allowed the company to increase prices for the second time in less than a year. "Spotify was able to show the value of the product to consumers because it had no noticeable churn increase from all of the pricing changes," Swinburne said. "And then, because they transitioned to a bundle, the margins of the business got meaningfully better." To that point, the long-term gross margin goal of 30% to 35% Ek set out for has already been achieved, with the metric once again expected to climb in the fourth quarter to 31.8%. "I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Insider Today: Blackstone's holiday cheer

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. You've likely heard the term "supercommuter," but you might have wondered… why? Someone who does it from Washington, DC, to NYC admits she's not sure the job is worth the commute. Still, she's not regretting doing it. On the agenda today: But first: Blackstone's feeling festive. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Blackstone released its annual holiday video for the seventh consecutive year, which might elicit the reaction: Why is a firm managing $1 trillion worried about holiday videos? The videos — full of self-deprecating jokes and Blackstone-backed product placement (of course) — have become a bit of an annual tradition on Wall Street. Last year's notched 8 million views across platforms, a spokesman told BI. We've got a full rundown and ranking of all seven videos here. Some people are laughing at Blackstone as opposed to with Blackstone, but that's kind of the point. In an industry full of super serious people doing super serious business for super serious clients, Blackstone's willing to make itself the butt of the joke. Ok, yes, there is a business case for the videos. Jay Gillespie, the head of Blackstone's video team and one of the brains behind the holiday extravaganza, spoke to BI's Alex Nicoll about the evolution of his role at the firm. Blackstone's not alone in its outside-the-box approach to marketing on the Street. More firms are getting a bit — to borrow a phrase from my British colleagues — cheeky in pitching themselves to the general public. Take BlackRock, which a few years ago took to social media to make clear it's not Blackstone. (The firms have a long history together and have sometimes lean into the confusion between the two. BlackRock CEO and cofounder Larry Fink made a cameo in Blackstone's holiday video this year: "Can you believe people confuse US for THEM?") Wall Street's marketing frenzy isn't foolproof. For an industry that prides itself on what kind of business you are bringing to a firm, marketing's impact isn't as direct as landing a massive deal or hitting the perfect trade. Wealthy musicians received millions of dollars from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, a pandemic relief program intended for struggling independent venues and arts groups. However, stars like Lil Wayne and Chris Brown used the program as a piggy bank to keep the party going, exclusive reporting from BI shows. Thousands of pages of accounting documents reveal how artists directed millions in taxpayer funds toward their own bank accounts, luxury purchases, and entertainment expenses — often outweighing what they spent on touring crew members. How musicians spent the grant money. Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, a Spanish duchess, devoted much of her life to cataloging the Archive of Medina-Sidonia, a priceless collection that had been in her family for generations. Comprising of 6 million documents, the archive details the secrets of the kings, dukes, and explorers of medieval Spain. After Luisa Isabel died, she left her three children just 743,000 euros. However, the bulk of her estate — and control of the archives — went to the woman she'd married on her deathbed. What ensued after was a bitter legal battle that would shatter the family, captivate Spain, and throw the fate of the archives into doubt. Inside the palace showdown. There is perhaps no real-estate metric more loved — and loathed — than Zillow's automated home valuation tool. The Zestimate draws casual clickers to the site, whether it's to lurk on previous residences, friends' or colleagues' homes, or the value of your neighbor's property against yours. The problem is that the Zestimate is often misguided, and Americans' obsession with it can create crushing reality checks when homes actually hit the market. But that's not a problem for Zillow. Earlier this month, Citigroup welcomed 34 managing directors, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, however, the bank's promotion process can be political and pit employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told BI. The bank rates its employees on a forced curve, assessing them from best to worst. These rankings influence whether an employee might receive a promotion or lose their bonus. Managing directors break down how it works. This week's quote: "What we're having to speak of already sounds like we're lying — it already sounds like a movie because it's so horrible." — Adria English worked as a dancer at Sean "Diddy" Combs' famous white parties and filed a lawsuit in July accusing him of sex trafficking. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault and sex trafficking.

Title: Pensacola Big Lots and Party City employees face sudden layoffs before holiday season

Now 44 Sun 55 Mon 60 by Hannah James TOPICS: PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Nearly 50 employees of both the Big Lots and Party City Pensacola locations are scrambling to find new jobs ahead of the holidays. WEAR News spoke with one employee who says he was given virtually no notice. And now, he's left in limbo. Major retail companies Party City and Big Lots gave their employees less than 24 hours notice that their companies were going to be shutting down. That happened five days before Christmas. Party City is closing all of its stores after 40 years of operation. Nearly 20 employees at the Pensacola location were told Friday that it will be their last day of employment. Employees at Big Lots faced a similar text from their CEO. Notification also came Thursday. "Our CEO got in contact with us all, and e-mail," says Big Lots employee Brent Smith. "My boss also sent us all an e-mail. That's how we were notified." In September, Big Lots announced its plan to sell its assets to the private equity firm, Nexus Capital Management. Thursday, the same day, Smith received a notification. The company announced the sale is unlikely to go through. "There's not an official date on store closure," Smith says. "But we just started today on getting the signs and stuff out like that." Smith has been working full-time at this Big Lots for seven years now. He and the nearly 30 employees are left to plan for the future with Christmas on the horizon. "Yeah, it's a horrible time. It's like a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, kick in the butt," Smith says. "Yeah, no plans as of right now. Just looking around. Hopefully, we can find something here soon... My wife has been sick, so I've been trying to deal with that. So, it's been a crazy, crazy, year... A crazy couple of months." To the CEO of Big Lots, Smith shares the following message. "Good luck. Because we need the good luck as well," says Smith. "No hard feeling, but still kind of a kick in the butt for right around this time, because everybody is going to be hurting." Specifically for the Big Lots at Oak Village in Pensacola, they do not know the definitive closing date yet. Big Lots blamed several economic factors for its bankruptcy, including high inflation and interest rates, leading customers to change their purchasing behavior. Party City blames growing competition from online retailers, like Amazon and Walmart.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Party City to close all of its stores, report says

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Party City on Friday announced it will close all of its stores and has initiated corporate layoffs effective immediately, according to a CNN report. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to “commence a winddown process immediately,” and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. “That is without question the most difficult message that I’ve ever had to deliver,” Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company’s closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw “many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers,” according to a press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween’s continued rise within and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October that it would open 10 new “Spirit Christmas” stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City’s operation, even as the company began to offer items on Amazon in 2018. Representatives for Party City did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on CNN’s report or potential story closures. Read the full CNN report here.

Title: The AI talent wars are just getting started

Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:26:09Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. For my last issue of the year, I’m focusing on the AI talent war, which is a theme I’ve been covering since this newsletter launched almost two years ago. And keep reading for the latest from inside Google and Meta this week. But first, I need your questions for a mailbag issue I’m planning for my first issue of 2025. You can submit questions via this form or leave them in the comments. This week, Databricks announced the largest known funding round for any private tech company in history. The AI enterprise firm is in the final stretch of raising $10 billion, almost all of which is going to go to buying back vested employee stock. How companies approach compensation is often undercovered in the tech industry, even though the strategies play a crucial role in determining which company gets ahead faster. Nowhere is this dynamic as intense as the war for AI talent, as I’ve covered before. To better understand what’s driving the state of play going into 2025, this week I spoke with Naveen Rao, VP of AI at Databricks. Rao is one of my favorite people to talk to about the AI industry. He’s deeply technical but also business-minded, having successfully sold multiple startups. His last company, MosaicML, sold to Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023. Now, he oversees the AI products for Databricks and is closely involved with its recruiting efforts for top talent. Our conversation below touches on the logic behind Databricks’s massive funding round, what specific AI talent remains scarce, why he thinks AGI is not imminent, and more. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: Why is this round mostly to help employees sell stock? Because $10 billion is a lot. You can do a lot with that. The company is a little over 11 years old. There have been employees that have been here for a long time. This is a way to get them liquidity. Most people don’t understand that this is not going into the balance sheet of Databricks. This is largely going to provide liquidity for past employees, [and] liquidity going forward for current and new employees. It ends up being neutral on dilution because they’re shares that already exist. They’ve been allocated to employees and this allows them to sell those to cover the tax associated with those shares. How much of the rapid increases in AI company valuations have to do with the talent war? It’s real. The key thing here is that it’s not just pure AI talent — people who come up with the next big thing, the next big paper. We are definitely trying to hire those people. There is an entire infrastructure of software and cloud that needs to be built to support those things. When you build a model and you want to scale it, that actually is not AI talent, per se. It’s infrastructure talent. The perceived bubble that we’re in around AI has created an environment where all of those talents are getting recruited heavily. We need to stay competitive. Who is being the most aggressive with setting market rates for AI talent? OpenAI is certainly there. Anthropic. Amazon. Google. Meta. xAI. Microsoft. We’re in constant competition with all of these companies. Would you put the number of researchers who can build a new frontier model under 1,000? Yeah. That’s why the talent war is so hot. The leverage that a researcher has in an organization is unprecedented. One researcher’s ideas can completely change the product. That’s kind of new. In semiconductors, people who came up with a new transistor architecture had that kind of leverage. That’s why these researchers are so sought after. Somebody who comes up with the next big idea and the next big unlock can have a massive influence on the ability of a company to win. Do you see that talent pool expanding in the near future or is it going to stay constrained? I see some aspects of the pool expanding. Being able to build the appropriate infrastructure and manage it, those roles are expanding. The top-tier researcher side is the hard part. It’s like looking for LeBron James. There are just not very many humans who are capable of that. I would say the Inflection-style acquisitions were largely driven by this kind of mentality. You have these concentrations of top-tier talent in these startups and it sounds ridiculous how much people pay. But it’s not ridiculous. I think that’s why you see Google hiring back Noam Shazeer. It’s very hard to find another Noam Shazeer. A guy we had at my previous company that I started, Nervana, is arguably the best GPU programmer in the world. He’s at OpenAI now. Every inference that happens on an OpenAI model is running through his code. You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, “Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.” “You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, ‘Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.’” What’s the edge you have when you’re trying to hire a researcher to Databricks? You start to see some selection bias of different candidates. Some are AGI or bust, and that’s okay. It’s a great motivation for some of the smartest people out there. We think we’re going to get to AGI through building products. When people use technology, it gets better. That’s part of our pitch. AI is in a massive growth base but it’s also hit peak hype and is on the way down the Gartner hype curve. I think we’re on that downward slope right now, whereas Databricks has established a very strong business. That’s very attractive to some because I don’t think we’re so susceptible to the hype. Do the researchers you talk to really believe that AGI is right around the corner? Is there any consensus of when it’s coming? Honestly, there’s not a great consensus. I’ve been in this field for a very long time and I’ve been pretty vocal in saying that it’s not right around the corner. The large language model is a great piece of technology. It has massive amounts of economic uplift and efficiencies that can be gained by building great products around it. But it’s not the spirit of what we used to call AGI, which was human or even animal-like intelligence. These things are not creating magical intelligence. They’re able to slice up the space that we’re calling facts and patterns more easily. It’s not the same as building a causal learner. They don’t really understand how the world works. You may have seen Ilya Sutskever’s talk. We’re all kind of groping in the dark. Scaling was a big unlock. It was natural for a lot of people to feel enthusiastic about that. It turns out that we weren’t solving the right problem. Is the new idea that’s going to get to AGI the test-time compute or “reasoning” approach? No. I think it’s going to be an important thing for performance. We can improve the quality of answers, probably reduce the probability of hallucinations, and increase the probability of having responses that are grounded in fact. It’s definitely a positive for the field. But is it going to solve the fundamental problem of the spirit of AGI? I don’t believe so. I’m happy to be wrong, too. Do you agree with the sentiment that there’s a lot of room to build more good products with existing models, since they are so capable but still constrained by compute and access? Yeah. Meta started years later than OpenAI and Anthropic and they basically caught up, and xAI caught up extremely fast. I think it’s because the rate of improvement has essentially stopped. Nilay Patel compares the AI model race to early Bluetooth. Everyone keeps saying there’s a fancier Bluetooth but my phone still won’t connect. You see this with every product cycle. The first few versions of the iPhone were drastically better than the previous versions. Now, I can’t tell the difference between a three-year-old phone and a new phone. I think that’s what we see here. How we utilize these LLMs and the distribution that has been built into them to solve business problems is the next frontier.

Title: How Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lost its glow amid layoffs and pivots
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-layoffs-restructuring-pivots-struggling-celebrity-brand-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Gwyneth Paltrow took a measured tone earlier this year when she discussed Goop, her newsletter turned e-commerce company, onstage at a Forbes event. She didn't brag about the nine figures the brand had raised or its latest product release. Instead, she said she was proud Goop was still in business. "Some years we're down, then we're back up," she said. "I'm proud that we're still alive and kicking." That might seem surprising for a company that was valued at $433 million in 2020 and was a trailblazer for what a celebrity brand could be. But it's reflective of a company that — despite its name recognition and pop-culture footprint — has undergone several painful pivots in recent years. In September, Goop laid off nearly 20% of its staff, including its chief technology officer and its vice president of content. A few weeks later, it laid off about 6% of the remaining employees. Goop's recent cuts come as the company shifts focus to its beauty, fashion, and food businesses. It's the latest in a series of strategy changes over the past several years. Changes in focus are normal for a startup. Still, after 16 years of existence, the company isn't profitable and continues to struggle to build a firm foundation apart from Paltrow. The company's once buzzy supplement regimens generated $100,000 in sales on the day they launched in 2017. Now, only one of the four initial regimens is still offered online, and for a discount. A Goop spokesperson told Business Insider that any new supplements it launched would be part of its beauty business. Julia Hunter, a Goop board member and the former CEO of Jenni Kayne, addressed some of the company's struggles in an interview with Puck, published after BI sent Goop a series of questions for this story. "The company is doing very well from a revenue perspective, butoperating expenses have continued to grow," Hunter said. "I know that it's unpopular to let people go, but they hired a lot of people that they probably shouldn't have." On the content side, Goop has recently cut many editorial positions, including the vice president of content, the head beauty editor, and several other editors. A review of Goop's website shows few new articles, and its book imprint hasn't published a new release in over a year. The magazine ran two issues before folding, and while there were reports that Goop's Netflix series, "The Goop Lab," was renewed, it hasn't materialized. Paltrow's importance to the brand is evident in product launches, two former Goop employees told BI. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation; their identities are known to BI. When she's part of a launch campaign, Goop calls it an "A launch," and the performance of the advertising on social media "quadruples," one of the former employees said. Performance often drops off once she's no longer involved, this person added. Last month, a video featuring Paltrow that promoted Goop's newest release, a retinol serum, drew 1,100 likes on Instagram. The next day, a second post about the serum — which didn't include Paltrow — got fewer than 275 likes. "Brands need to find viable business models, rather than simply a celebrity face," Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital, said of A-list entrepreneurs. The celebrity brands that have grown to be the largest — like Kim Kardashian's Skims, Rihanna's Fenty, and Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty — have moved beyond their founder's image. Skims, which is valued at $4 billion, has made using models from popular culture a core part of its marketing strategy, for instance. Goop's founding story has become lore to a certain type of aspirant. In 2008, Paltrow was sitting in the kitchen of the London house she shared with her then-husband, Chris Martin, when she decided to write a newsletter for "family, friends, and friends of friends." The issue featured a recipe for banana muffins and photos shot on Paltrow's BlackBerry. "It was one of the first of its kind to leverage a curated lifestyle of a celebrity," Stacy Jones, the CEO of the branding agency Hollywood Branded, told BI. "It is aligned to her own personal brand in a very unique way that hadn't been done to that extent before." Before long, Paltrow was earning small checks from advertisers and began dreaming of a media empire. Paltrow hired media veterans from Meredith and Condé Nast to run the publication. There was a lifestyle website with travel guides and interviews on alternative medicine. Paltrow launched a publishing imprint, Goop Press, in 2015 and a magazine in partnership with Condé Nast in 2017. Conferences promised to be the next big thing for the brand when the In Goop Health Summit series kicked off in 2017, offering (mainly) women the promise of looking and feeling like Paltrow for the four-figure ticket price. In 2020, as streaming entered its golden age, she scored a deal with Netflix. But Goop suffered in recent years amid a broader digital media downturn. "Advertising business as a big part of revenue started to decline, and that was probably the biggest shift to revenue of the last several years," Hunter told Puck, adding that going forward, editorial would be "integrated with social media." Paltrow still posts regular episodes of the Goop podcast, and after a few years off because of the pandemic, the In Goop Health Summit returned last year. That said, Goop's media projects appear to have been largely shut down, as many of the staffers behind them were affected by the recent cuts. As Goop's media initiatives fell short, its e-commerce ambitions — or what the company dubbed "contextual commerce" — took center stage. The core of its e-commerce business has ebbed and flowed over the years. First, it pushed skincare, then fashion, then wellness. Now, it's back to beauty and fashion. "It's a lot of testing" of different verticals, the second former employee said. In May, Goop brought in outside consultants, led by Hunter, to help streamline the organization and reduce payroll. Then, in September, Goop announced its latest pivot, saying it would double down on fashion, beauty, and food. These aren't new initiatives for Goop, but the company has touted their recent growth. G. Label, the company's in-house clothing line, launched in 2016. The company told BI that the brand's sales were up 45% this year compared with the same period last year, but it declined to share the revenue numbers. The two former employees said they felt G. Label had historically underperformed partly because it was initially designed to fit Paltrow, who, at a slender 5-foot-9, has a much different figure from that of the average American woman. "We were just putting together whatever Gwyneth felt like wearing," the first former employee said. They added that the company revised the line in the past year using a new, standard-fit model, which they said had helped its sales. The Goop spokesperson said a new designer had been hired for G. Label in the past year and revamped the line. Goop's first foray into beauty was also in 2016. A few of the products have repeat customers — the neck peptide serum is a top seller — but there isn't a breakthrough hero product. Some recent efforts to expand the beauty offerings haven't taken off. Last year, the company launched Good Clean Goop, a moderately priced line, in Target and Amazon. Since then, the company has discounted a number of the brand's products, including the Daily Juice Cleanser and the Healthy Aging Serum. Puck reported in June that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target. The brand has not posted on social media in more than a month. The two former employees said Goop's contract with Target would end at the beginning of next year. Then there's Goop Kitchen, the "food" piece, which is not part of the core company. The Goop spokesperson said Goop Kitchen was set up as a joint venture and called it a "separate commercial entity." They declined to share what ownership stake Goop has, if any. Goop has publicly touted growth statistics — like a 25% sales increase for Goop Beauty and a 45% increase for G. Label. The former employees said these figures were driven in part by an influx of paid ad spend. The Goop spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is profitable. Hunter told Puck it wasn't. Whether Goop's latest efforts to boost revenue and cut back on staff are enough to turn the company around remains to be seen. Paltrow, for her part, has hinted that she wants Goop to thrive without her. "I don't think I can have this job forever," she told The New York Times last year. "I think it would be nice to return my investors' money, and I really want to do that. That's important to me." Jump to
