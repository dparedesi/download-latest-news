"Everybody was happy with the progress," said Kostersitz, then a principal product manager lead working on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. "Everything was peachy." The following morning, he noticed a high-priority virtual meeting had been added to his calendar — and it wasn't good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said the Washington-based 60-year-old. His manager and two of his direct reports were also among the 6,000 employees affected. In July, roughly 9,000 more were laid off. Previously, in January and February, Microsoft had made nearly 2,000 performance-based cuts. I spoke with seven of the Microsoft workers who lost their jobs over the past 12 months. Microsoft was once known for its "country club" culture, but as Ashley Stewart reported for Business Insider earlier this year, leaders worried the company had gone soft, and it ramped up scrutiny on performance. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. A Microsoft spokesperson has said that most of this year's cuts were not performance-based but were intended to reduce management layers and streamline operations. Along with Amazon, Meta, and Google, Microsoft is one of many companies — from Silicon Valley to corporate America — that are fueling the Great Flattening. The tenure of the ex-Microsofters I spoke to ranged from a few years to more than three decades. Some said any sense of job security they once had was shattered. Several said they were caught off guard by their layoffs, citing factors like long tenure, no documented performance issues, and Microsoft's position as the world's third-most valuable company. They wondered: If job security is dead at Microsoft, will they find it anywhere else? Kostersitz is one of them. To help with his job search, he said a Microsoft-funded career advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by erasing work done in the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now only shows professional experience since 2003. The advisor also emphasized that today's job market is an endurance test. "They said it's a game of chicken right now," he said. "The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: The experiences of laid-off Microsoft employees are part of a broader shift in corporate America. As Business Insider's Aki Ito has reported, job security was a defining feature of white-collar work during the postwar boom, a period when layoffs and firings were rare. However, globalization — and the overseas competition that accompanied it — gave rise to a new management philosophy focused on cost-cutting, downsizing, and viewing employees as interchangeable. It's not just about flattening. In cuts this year, companies have cited AI — if not directly for taking jobs, then for creating an environment in which companies can operate with leaner staff. It's what workers have been fearing will happen on a large scale as AI continues to improve and become increasingly omnipresent. While Microsoft's culture has evolved over the years, some laid-off employees said they believe the recent cuts show the company has entered a new era — one where avoiding layoffs appears to be a lower priority. The former Microsoft employees, in addition to dozens of other laid-off workers I've spoken with over the past year, told me they are grappling with how to protect their careers and financial well-being after an unexpected chop. Before Eduardo Noriega was laid off by Microsoft in May, he'd been nervous about his job security since 2009, when the company cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a side business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. By the time he was cut in May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit Microsoft and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." For other workers across corporate America, the challenge of landing a new role in today's economy has upped the stakes of sudden unemployment. While layoffs across the broader economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar roles have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," said Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, she said, the shift may feel especially stark. Ian Carter began working at Microsoft in 2021, and he said the company's layoffs in 2023 and 2024 sent a clear message: His job wasn't safe. "It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not," said the 33-year-old. "Everybody was at risk." Since being laid off in May from his position as a technical program manager, he has struggled to find a job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses and switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he stored his belongings and moved to Florida to live with his family and save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." In May, Joe Friend learned that he and 14 other members of his working group had been laid off. Friend's tenure at Microsoft spanned more than two decades across three stints, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend said he believes there's been a culture shift within Microsoft — one that's left employees with less job security than they once had. Some of his concerns extend beyond Microsoft to Big Tech more broadly — which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role. "I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about," said the 62-year-old. "It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech." Deborah Hendersen took a different approach. After 14 years at Microsoft, Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, was one of about 9,000 employees laid off in July. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she began laying the groundwork for her future. She shared a message internally and on LinkedIn to tell her network that she'd been laid off and to learn who else had been affected. This led to the creation of a Discord chat of more than a dozen affected colleagues, where people shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Hendersen also turned to her network to find openings and secure referrals. One of the roles recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. She received a referral and, in late August, a job offer. Hendersen credited her network — and in particular her laid-off colleagues — for supporting her during this challenging period. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time." Jump to

Title: Is the job market getting worse? As the shutdown continues, this is what we know

Scott Horsley The government shutdown has delayed a report on the October job market. That leaves policymakers looking for other signals about the pace of hiring and firing. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption The government shutdown is again making it it hard to answer a critical question: How is the U.S. job market doing? The impasse in Congress over funding has delayed a closely-watched report on the labor market for the second month in a row. Without that official jobs tally, the available signals are mixed. This week, a big payroll processing company reported an uptick in October hiring, for example. But a consulting firm that tracks pink slips noted a big surge in layoff notices. Policymakers typically look to monthly surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the broadest and most accurate snapshot of the job market. But BLS number-crunchers have been furloughed for more than five weeks, so the September and October jobs reports have not been published. "Due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech," Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday. "The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted." But Cook insisted she and her colleagues are not "flying blind." They look to private-sector data for signals about hiring and firing, as well as anecdotal reports from a wide range of business contacts. Workers and people looking for work do the same, as they form their own impressions of the job market — and there are signs of concern. A measure of employee sentiment from the job-search website Glassdoor found workers are less confident about the availability of jobs now than they've been in the last three months. Glassdoor users who received a job offer in October were less likely to turn it down than the previous month, suggesting that workers feel they have less leverage in the current market. "October's decline in employee confidence reflects how quickly economic uncertainty can ripple through the workforce," said Glassdoor's chief economist Daniel Zhao. "The government shutdown and mounting layoff fears have clearly shaken employee sentiment." A number of high-profile companies such as Amazon and UPS have announced widespread layoffs in recent weeks, which likely weighs on workers' confidence. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says U.S. businesses announced plans to cut 153,074 jobs last month — the worst October in more than two decades. Tech firms and warehousing companies reported some of the biggest downsizing plans. "Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market," says Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the firm. State tallies of new unemployment claims have remained relatively stable, however, suggesting that there hasn't been a big spike in overall layoffs yet. On the positive side, ADP, which handles payroll for more than 26 million U.S. employees, says it counted an increase in the number of private-sector employees last month, after two months of decline. "Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July," says ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson. At the same time, Richardson notes that "hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year." A recruiter speaks with job seekers at a job fair held in Sunrise, Fl., on Sept. 25, 2025. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption Official data from the BLS had also shown a slowdown in hiring during the summer, before the government shutdown halted its reporting. Employers added just 22,000 jobs in August — the last month for which official numbers are available. Some of the drop in job growth could be the result of having fewer available workers. Some 10,000 baby boomers retire every day. And the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement likely means there are fewer foreign-born workers in the job market. While the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% in August, that's still quite low by historical standards. "The slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so," Cook said Monday. She cautioned however that unemployment rates for young and African American workers jumped more sharply over the summer, which could be a warning sign. The jobless rate for workers aged 20-24 in August was 9.2% while the unemployment rate among African Americans was 7.5%. "This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy," Cook said, "when the well-off are doing well, while [lower-income families] and vulnerable households are not." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: There's no jobs report today, but here's what private data is telling us about the labor market

Every time Madison publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economists, journalists, and investors won't be waiting by their laptops this morning for a new jobs report. It's the second month without this data release. The agency isn't releasing most reports or collecting data during the government shutdown, which is the longest one in US history. However, job seekers, economists, and anyone else missing the BLS reports can turn to recent publications from ADP, Indeed, Bank of America, and others to get a sense of how the job market and broader economy are doing. The analyses showed that October was still a tough month for job seekers. Announced job cuts climbed based on a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas; demand cooled to a level not seen in years based on job postings on Indeed; and various reports together show a soft job market. Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider it's lucky that there are a lot of private sector data releases to "piece together a picture of what's going on in the economy." However, she added that even those alternative sources often rely on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calibrate their work, so without it, job-market clarity is muddied. Here's what recent releases said about October's job market. Based on ADP payroll data, the US added 42,000 private sector jobs in October after falling in the previous two months. Despite beating the 32,000 consensus, Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in the news release that hiring was modest. Most of the net growth came from large companies that have at least 500 employees. Job growth was mixed by industry. Trade, transportation, and utilities together added 47,000 jobs. Employment dipped in information, manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality. Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in commentary that the federal layoffs — which aren't included in the ADP national employment report — would pretty much cancel out the private employment growth in October. Many government workers aren't working during the government shutdown and are missing pay. Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that announced job cuts from US-based employers skyrocketed over the month to the highest October total since 2003 — increasing from 54,064 to 153,074 this past October. Last month's gain means over 1 million announced cuts so far this year, more than the roughly 761,000 cuts for the entire previous year. "Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes," Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer, said in the report. Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, recently told Business Insider that companies like Amazon, which announced a reduction of 14,000 corporate workers, are likely correcting for overhiring during the pandemic-era and Great Resignation. Shrivastava told Business Insider the US is in a precarious, not dangerous situation based on the platform's data. Job postings trended downward last month, hitting the lowest point since 2021. "Things have been kind of eroding slowly," Shrivastava said. "Not a lot of job growth added, still really difficult to break into the labor market, people still really holding onto their jobs." It's not just employees sitting still; Shrivastava said employers have mainly been holding onto workers. Despite new cuts making news, BLS data up to August showed US layoff rates have been low for years — the 2021 to 2025 average of 1.0% is a hair below the 2015 to 2019 average of 1.2%. Shrivastava said a surge in layoffs would "be kind of the thing that tips the tower over." Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said in a post that October hiring wasn't too far off from September, although it did fall 0.8% and down from the start of the year. The number of job openings per applicant has also been cooling, and dropped 1% over the month. Kantenga said in the post that both supply and demand have dropped. "The job market has been running slow, it's continuing to run slow," Kantenga told Business Insider. "There just isn't a lot of momentum across the board." Kantenga told Business Insider that job seekers need to be open to industries that are still hiring, such as healthcare and construction. "There are areas where things have actually started to turn around, but they're not yet where they need to be for there to be a lot of opportunities," Kantenga said. "Technology, information, and media is one." The Bank of America Institute said there was "​​no significant further slowdown in the labor market" last month based on internal data on how many of the bank's customers are getting paychecks. "While this data does suggest a slowdown in jobs growth has taken place since the summer, it tends to suggest that for now at least, there is no further deceleration," the new report said. Unemployment payments were up from a year ago, but the report said the growth rate cooled slightly from September. Across the board, households had higher pay than a year ago, but higher-income households had the highest rise. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small businesses, found that the hiring rate and quits rate at those businesses cooled in October. Net hires at small businesses also fell by 5,900, the first drop since January. Average hourly earnings are also up a little bit from a year ago. "We're witnessing a significant shift in small business hiring patterns," Andrew Chamberlain, the principal economist at Gusto, said, adding there's essentially no job growth happening compared to the growth during the post-pandemic recovery. "The culprits are clear: persistently high borrowing costs that keep business loans at 7-15%, ongoing tariff uncertainty that makes planning nearly impossible, and elevated operating expenses across the board," he said. More rate cuts could help business owners. The Fed cut rates in September and October after holding rates steady throughout 2025. Chamberlain said Gusto expects a rebound "as the Fed starts to relax interest rates in the coming year." Jump to

Title: ‘Predator: Badlands,’ ‘Peaky Blinders,’ ‘The Bride!’ All Harness France VFX Expertise

Postproduction studios The Yard and One of Us herald growing maturity, resilience in French VFX sector By Ben Croll France’s vibrant VFX sector now stands at the forefront of the country’s broader push to strengthen its global production appeal, reflecting a national strategy that has championed the craft ever since the 2020 revision of the Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP). That update introduced a 10% bonus on all eligible expenses for productions spending over $2.3 million with local VFX houses. Five years on, the incentive has proven transformative, driving studio expansion, nurturing talent and attracting a steady stream of high-profile international projects to French soil. Related Stories AFI Fest Programmers on Headlining With Bruce Springsteen, Recruiting Guillermo del Toro and Standing Out in L.A.’s Avid Filmgoing Scene How Rachel Sennott Learned to 'Love L.A.,' Pushed Past Hollywood Execs Thinking She's Just 'Slutty on Twitter' and Created HBO's Next Big Comedy Today, the sector has reached maturity — and with maturity comes resilience. The unexpected collapse of Technicolor triggered layoffs and production disruptions, while a broader post-pandemic slowdown has seen commissions drop nearly 30%. With AI disruption and studio consolidation looming, growth increasingly depends on adaptability. Popular on Variety “Flexibility, agility and teamwork define the new business model,” says the Yard founder and CEO Laurens Ehrmann. “Our midsize structure offers a real advantage. Clients know their projects matter, that they’ll get an A-team, and that we’ll always respond quickly.” With outposts in Paris, Montpellier and now London — a move to access multiple tax credits while staying close to partners like Amazon and Netflix — the Yard has tied its expansion directly to relationship management. Case in point: after working on 2019’s “Ford v Ferrari,” the Yard maintained strong ties with the project’s VFX supervisor, who later entrusted them with advanced creature work on this year’s “Predator: Badlands.” Tasked with a milestone sequence, the studio built an animation, character, creature and digidouble pipeline from scratch, handling 120 complex shots and creating a robust toolset for future creature FX. “Working on creatures is one of the most complex parts of VFX,” Ehrmann explains. “Mastering it allows you to bid on entire sequences with vast environments and complex characters, now positioning us as a tier-one VFX company.” Executives from VFX studio One of Us describe their work on 2024’s “Damsel” as similarly transformative. The studio delivered over 400 shots, including 250 featuring a fully realized, emotive dragon, with the rest dedicated to large-scale destruction and fully 3D environments. Splitting the work between outposts in London and Paris, the studio’s teams collaborated seamlessly, emerging from this trial-by-fire with cost-saving insights. “Getting involved early is critical,” says Emmanuel Pichereau, CCO of One of Us. “It allows us to plan strategically, reduce shot counts, control costs and, most importantly, align with the film’s storytelling from the very beginning when changes are still flexible.” The studio is applying this philosophy to upcoming projects like “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.” For both, the team is working from its Paris office to qualify for the full French tax rebate, crafting visual effects designed to be seamless rather than showy. “We want to blend into these worlds,” says CEO Rachael Penfold. “We’re there to serve the story and realize the filmmakers’ vision, not to show off. The best visual effect is often the one you never notice.” But Penfold is happy to tout the French value proposition — and she recently traveled to Los Angeles to championed Gallic talent at industry sessions and case studies. “The French film industry is mature, and its talent is often immersed in a culture of great filmmaking, not just trained on specific software,” Penfold says. “The emphasis is cultural — it’s about artistic problem-solving and craftsmanship. While some focus on technical details, French artists tend to take a more holistic, well-rounded view. That mindset brings added value to every project.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Tech layoffs surge to 33,281 in October as AI and economic fears trigger historic job cuts

U.S. employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October, the highest for that month in more than two decades.

The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with job cuts up 145% this year. The American dream is unraveling for hundreds of thousands of workers as a tidal wave of corporate layoffs crashes through the economy. A disappointing new report for October reveals the highest level of job cuts for that month in more than two decades, shattering the illusion of a stable recovery and exposing a labor market in deep distress. The tech sector, once a bastion of high-paying jobs, is leading the charge in this devastating downturn, leaving seasoned professionals struggling to afford basic necessities in an economy that appears to be turning against them. According to the latest data from executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. employers axed 153,074 jobs in October alone. This represents a staggering 183% increase from September and is the worst October for layoffs since 2003. The total number of job cuts for 2025 has now soared past 1.09 million, reaching its highest level since the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns of 2020. A tech industry in retreat The technology industry is experiencing a brutal correction. Tech companies announced 33,281 layoffs in October, a dramatic surge from the 5,639 cuts reported in September. So far this year, the tech sector has announced 141,159 job cuts, a 17% increase from the 120,470 cuts during the same period in 2024. This data confirms that the mass layoffs that began at giants like Microsoft and Amazon in recent years have evolved into a full-blown industry-wide crisis. The drivers behind this historic downsizing are a toxic cocktail of economic pressures and technological disruption. Andy Challenger, the companyâs workplace expert and chief revenue officer, explained the confluence of factors in the report. âSome industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,â he said. This sentiment echoes past justifications from corporate leaders, such as Amazonâs Andy Jassy, who previously stated that layoffs would help pursue âlong-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.â The human cost of business efficiency The human cost of this corporate âbelt-tighteningâ is immense. The report delivers a chilling finding for those who have lost their jobs: âthose laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â This is a devastating blow to white-collar professionals who once enjoyed high demand for their skills. The report notes that many are now struggling to afford food, gas, and housing, with some former tech recruiters resorting to exhausting retail and catering jobs just to survive. While companies often cite artificial intelligence as a key reason for cuts, some experts question if AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat. Companies explicitly blamed AI for 31,039 of the October layoffs, making it the second-most cited reason after general cost-cutting. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

Title: Final Fantasy developer Square Enix plans to automate 70% of its QA with AI even as it continues layoffs in the west

Square Enix is pushing to automate 70% of its QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027, following its announcement of widespread layoffs across its Western offices. The company explained its new initiative in its latest progress report for its medium-term business plan, “Square Enix Reboots and Awakens,” to address problems such as low sales of games like Final Fantasy XIV. Square Enix is teaming up with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, consisting of a team of researchers from the lab and Square Enix engineers. The end goal is to make QA faster and cheaper. QA testing traditionally involves manual testing of games for bugs, glitches, and issues, which is exhausting in titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Square Enix’s report explicitly stated, “To automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.” This means that an AI debugging system could automatically generate test scenarios, simulate player behavior, and isolate bugs and issues in video games. While similar tools exist in engines like Unreal Engine 5, Square Enix seems determined to take things a step further. However, this development strategy doesn’t come without sacrifice, as on the very same day Square Enix laid off over 100 employees across its UK, U.S., and European offices, calling it a “fundamental restructuring” of its overseas publishing arm and a “best position for the group’s long-term growth.” However, the company didn’t explicitly state that the job cuts were linked to the QA AI push. Still, speculation suggests the company could soon replace a significant portion of its testing staff with AI. Square Enix isn’t the only company leaping into AI, though. A September 2025 survey by CESA asked 54 companies about AI, and 51% confirmed they’re using generative AI for artwork, story concepts, and coding. An additional 31% confirmed they were using AI to build game engines. Square Enix claims AI will help the company compete in an industry where AAA games are costing exponentially more to develop over the years due to rising licensing, labor, and QA costs as the bar continues to be raised higher. It is important, however, to note that the company itself is doing considerably well financially this quarter, thanks in part to Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Despite its enthusiasm, the QA automation push seems like a high-stakes bet for the company, as it risks alienating talent that might be hard to replace should it backfire. Employee morale is already strained at the company, and the coming years will show if Square Enix’s “reboot” will genuinely pay off.

Title: Laid off? Tech recruiting exec shares 4 tips for getting back on your feet—and on the job market

Time Published: 2025-11-06T21:55:02Z

It’s a day every IT pro dreads: hearing about layoffs within your company, then being summoned into an HR manager’s office and being dismissed. The tech industry is going through a purge. Earlier this week, IBM announced plans to layoff a portion of its workforce. Meanwhile, Amazon shared plans to axe 14,000 employees and Meta let go of 600 workers from its AI unit last month. After a layoff comes the uncomfortable question: “What’s next?” For most, it’s dusting yourself off and looking for a new opportunity. According to Overture Partners CRO Mark Aiello, that can be a grueling process. “Definitely no one ever went to bed on Sunday night saying, ‘Hey, I get to look for a new job. Tomorrow is going to be great!’” Aiello said. Dusting off the ol’ résumé. IT Brew caught up with Diana Huang, VP of technology staffing agency Prosum’s Southern California market, to learn how IT pros can make their job search less cumbersome, as well as proper résumé etiquette. Huang said one of the most important things an IT pro can do to improve their résumé is to demonstrate their accomplishments through numbers or other measurable metrics. “It could be ‘Reduced cloud spend by 15% through automation,’ or ‘Improved deployment frequency from weekly to daily,’” Huang said. “It’s adding numbers and specifics and showing your impact.” She added that professionals should make sure résumé details match what’s on their LinkedIn profile. A good résumé is also as concise as possible. “Don’t write a novel. No one’s going to read 15 pages,” Huang said. “Let’s try to really keep it short. If you’re more junior, five years [or] under, keep it [to] one page and try to keep it really concise.” Applicants are also working against applicant tracking systems, software used by hiring managers to filter and rank résumés by specified keywords or qualifications, according to Aiello, who added these “magic” algorithms can complicate things for job-seekers. “It’s more secret than anything the CIA does that they don’t explain, and you have to hope that you have the right keywords and the right weighting and all of that,” he said. Because of this, Aiello advises that applicants avoid using LinkedIn’s Easy Apply function and similar tools, and instead take time tailoring résumés to feature skills mentioned in the job descriptions of the desired role. “[Overusing Easy Apply] should mean ‘I like to be ghosted’…because that’s basically what’s going to happen to you,” Aiello said. He added that those who do feel inclined to use the function should do additional research and reach out to hiring managers separately. How to be a notable networker. Networking is also important when professionals are seeking a new opportunity, Aiello added. He said professionals seeking a new role should be specific when discussing their ideal role with their industry connections. “Don’t just say, ‘I’m looking for a job.’ Help them think exactly of what it is that you do in terms that they can understand,” he said. Emailing or texting similar job postings can help to illustrate what an IT pro is looking for. Huang suggests tech professionals build strong connections with a handful of local recruiters who specialize in IT. “If you’re able to have those strong relationships, they will give you access to opportunities that will give you a better chance, rather than just submitting an application and a lot of times turning into a black hole,” she said. She also advised professionals to announce that they are seeking work on LinkedIn and similar platforms. “I bet you a lot of people who would see that and have worked with you would be like, ‘Oh, I’m so sad to hear that, but I know of so and so who might be looking. Let me make that connection,’” Huang said. “So, don’t be afraid to broadcast that.” The golden rules of job hunting. Aiello said it is important for professionals to remember to maintain contact with networked connections, even after they land a new job. “If the only time you hear from your friend is when you need a ride to the airport or you need help moving after a while, they’re no longer going to be your friend,” he said. Huang added that job-seekers should let recruiters know if they lose interest in a position or leave the candidate pool altogether. “If you ghost, then you will be blacklisted out of their system, and they will not present you again to their clients.” This report was originally published by IT Brew. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

US employers axed about 153,000 workers last month — making it the worst October for layoffs in two decades and bringing total firings for the year so far to over 1 million, according to a new report that noted many companies blamed the latest layoffs on AI. The last time the US saw a worse October in terms of firings was in 2003, when 171,874 people were laid off. As in the aughts, the latest layoff numbers came amid a time of tech-driven realignment for the economy. Back then, the issue was changes in the telecom industry sparked by the rise of cell phones, experts say; today, it’s the advent of AI and automating tasks once done by humans. Companies cited artificial intelligence in 31,039 of the October layoffs — second only to general cost-cutting — according to the report Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s chief revenue officer. AI was explicitly blamed for relatively few of the total job cuts so far this year — just 48,414 of them, according to the data. October’s 153,074 job cuts marked a 183% spike from September — when 54,064 positions were slashed — and a 175% jump from the same month a year ago, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found. Analysts and businesses having been using the firm’s reports, which usually draw little notice, while official jobs data has stalled because of the government shutdown. Through the first 10 months of 2025, announced layoffs topped 1.09 million — a 65% increase from the 664,839 job cuts last year and the highest total since 2020, when pandemic shutdowns sent pink slips soaring. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Challenger. The data shows technology and warehousing companies led October’s cuts. Tech firms announced 33,281 layoffs, up sharply from 5,639 the prior month, while warehousing firms axed 47,878 jobs — a surge driven by automation and lingering overcapacity from pandemic-era expansion. For the year, the tech industry has slashed 141,159 jobs so far — up 17% from the 120,470 that were announced through the same period in 2024. The retail sector also remains under pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, up 145% from 2024, as chains face weaker discretionary spending and ongoing store closures. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” said Challenger. Warehousing, services, and consumer product firms also joined the retrenchment, while media and nonprofit organizations reported mounting losses tied to automation and reduced government funding. Challenger said nonprofits have announced 27,651 job cuts this year — up more than 400% — while the media industry logged 16,680, a 26% increase. Overall, companies cited cost-cutting in 50,437 October layoffs, followed by artificial intelligence, market conditions and facility closures. The layoffs seem unlikely to stop anytime soon. Amazon, Target, Paramount Skydance and Starbucks have each moved to cut hundreds or thousands of positions, underscoring the breadth of the corporate pullback heading into the holidays. Amazon said last week it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles, part of a reorganization to “further reduce bureaucracy” and shift resources toward artificial intelligence. At Target, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke announced the company’s first major layoffs in a decade, cutting 1,800 corporate jobs — roughly 8% of its headquarters staff — as the retailer struggles with a sales slump and aims to “simplify how we work.” UPS recently announced it would lay off 48,000 workers as part of a sweeping cost-cutting initiative. In Hollywood, Paramount Skydance began cutting about 2,000 positions, or 10% of its workforce, following its merger approval earlier this year. Starbucks filed notice to Washington state regulators that it will lay off 974 employees in Seattle and Kent starting Dec. 5. The non-retail layoffs follow earlier cuts across Washington State as CEO Brian Niccol restructures the company after a post-pandemic downturn. Even as layoffs accelerate, hiring plans have slowed dramatically. Employers have announced 488,077 planned hires through October — down 35% from last year and the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the figure in 2012. “At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable,” Challenger said. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Advertisement

Title: October Layoffs the Worst Since 2003

Layoffs in the US have reached recession-level numbers, reports the Washington Post, which cites new data from the private firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas to back that up: So far this year, employers have announced 1.1 million job cuts, a figure in line with the Great Recession of 2008-09, and the biggest number since the pandemic. Layoffs are up 65% over last year, per Reuters. October alone saw more than 153,000 cuts—a 183% jump from the previous month, per the Post—making it the worst October for layoffs since 2003. "We're entering new territory with these layoffs in October," says John Challenger, the firm's CEO. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009." The hardest-hit sectors include technology, retail, warehousing, and service. Technology firms, in particular, have cited the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence as a factor, with tech layoffs up 17% from last year. Despite the spike in layoffs, the broader economy appears stable for now, per the Post. The most recent official data puts the unemployment rate at 4.3%, though economists warn that conditions could deteriorate quickly. In fact, the rate is expected to reach 4.5% in the coming months, per CBS News.

Layoffs in the U.S. rose sharply in October 2025 as companies tried to save money and adjust to new AI technology. Many big firms, including tech companies, reduced jobs. Experts say rising costs and slower spending are also reasons for the cuts, making it harder for people to find new work this year.

Title: Monthly job cuts surged to a 22-year high in October

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time U.S.-based companies announced more than 153,000 job cuts in October, the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008," the firm said in a news release. From January through the end of October, employers have announced the elimination of nearly 1.1 million jobs. It's the most Challenger has recorded since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the global economy. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month," Andy Challenger, the firm's chief revenue officer, said in a statement. The last time there was a higher October monthly total was in 2003. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he said. On Wednesday, the private payroll processor ADP released its own October jobs data, showing that employers added just 42,000 jobs in the month. The ADP report also flagged job losses in the leisure and hospitality sector as a potential sign of trouble ahead, given the industry’s acute sensitivity to consumer sentiment. ADP's chief economist called the losses in hospitality and leisure a "concerning trend." Both Challenger and ADP's reports landed as major companies such as Amazon, IBM, UPS, Target, Microsoft, Paramount and General Motors announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Despite the wave of downbeat economic news, the Trump administration continues to deliver an upbeat take on the current environment. “Jobs are booming” and “inflation is falling,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. However, the most recent available data paints a different picture. Inflation has also been on the rise. Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index overall have risen every month since April. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Challenger report. Challenger’s report does not typically carry the same weight with economists and investors as federal jobs data, owing to its methodology. To arrive at its figures, the firm compiles the number of job cuts companies have publicly announced. But employers may not ultimately carry out all the cuts they roll out. Moreover, some of the job cuts that multinational companies announce could affect workers outside of the United States. Other headcount reductions could be achieved through attrition, rather than layoffs. The report also may not capture smaller layoffs over the long run. But in the midst of a federal data blackout caused by the government shutdown, Challenger’s latest report is being read more closely than usual. The federal government's October jobs report that would traditionally be released Friday will not be published this week, due to the shutdown. Other key data about the U.S. economy like GDP and an inflation indicator called PCE, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, has also been delayed. Challenger equated the impact of AI on the current labor market to the rise of the internet in the early aughts. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” it said. "Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures," Challenger said. But even firms that are not actively cutting jobs have warned that they do not plan to add to their headcount in the near term, with several pointing directly to AI’s impact on their personnel needs. On Wednesday night, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN that headcount at his company would likely remain steady as the nation's largest bank rolls out AI internally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also recently told his employees that the firm would "constrain headcount growth through the end of the year," as it takes advantage of AI efficiencies, Bloomberg reported.

Cut through the chaos.Americans just sent Trump a clear message — and Dems are calling it "a 5-alarm fire" for the president. Our reporters are here to keep you informed and make sense of Washington's chaos. Join HuffPost and be part of what happens next. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based employers cut more than 150,000 jobs in October, marking the biggest reduction for the month in more than 20 years, a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday as industries adopt AI-driven changes and intensify cost cuts. Tech firms led the job cuts in the private sector, followed by retailers and the services sector, the global outplacement company said. Cost-cutting was the top reason for the layoffs in October, followed by artificial intelligence, while “DOGE Impact” was the leading reason for job cuts in 2025. The layoffs in October surged 175% from a year ago to 153,074. From the start of the year to October end, employers have announced 1,099,500 job cuts, a 65% rise from 664,839 in the same time period last year. So far this year, job cuts are at the highest level since 2020 when 2,304,755 cuts were announced through October. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Americans just sent Trump a clear message — and Dems are calling it "a 5-alarm fire" for the president. Our reporters are here to keep you informed and make sense of Washington's chaos.

Δ That’s a 175% jump from October of 2024 and 183% higher than the 54,064 cuts announced in September of this year, per a Thursday (Nov. 6) report by outplacement and executive coaching company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and the company’s chief revenue officer, said in a news release. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” The report also notes that October’s total is the highest for that month since October of 2023, which saw a surge of layoffs in the retail space because of acquisitions, and in telecommunications as cell phones became more popular. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Challenger. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue He added the onset of social media has allowed workers to share their negative work experience, meaning the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays faded away, “a practice that seemed particularly cruel.” Among the companies cutting jobs last month was Amazon, which said it planned to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate roles. The report comes one day after the announcement of planned Senate legislation that would require major companies and federal agencies to report artificial intelligence-related layoffs, hires, job displacements, retraining and other impacts to the Labor Department. The bill would also require the DOL to compile data on AI-related job effects and publish a report to Congress and the public, according to a press release issued Wednesday (Nov. 5) by the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Meanwhile, research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Generation AI: Why Gen Z Bets Big and Boomers Hold Back” found that among people who use generative AI, 33% are worried that the technology might threaten people’s jobs. That concern is most pronounced among Generation Z, with 38% of the gen AI users in that age bracket worried about the impact on employment. The report said Gen Z users tend to have — or are looking for — the types of entry-level jobs that the technology can most easily replace.

Title: AI open letter by Amazon workers
URL: https://www.amazonclimatejustice.org/open-letter
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:49:42Z
Full Content:
Amazon coworkers: sign our open letter below to tell Amazon leadership that we need a more responsible rollout of AI. Every single signature makes our message stronger. In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond. We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth. We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm: Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas. Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional. Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance. All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need. We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following: No AI with dirty energy.No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments. No AI without employee voices.We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact. No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine. The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are. This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of. Signed, The Amazon employees below I signed the letter, what else can I do to help? Fill out our Get Involved form! We have a lot of work ahead to hold leadership accountable and we need all the help we can get. If you don’t work at Amazon, click here tosign on to a solidarity statement. I'm not an Amazon employee! What can I do? Your support can still help to strengthen our message to Amazon leadership. Click here to sign on anonymously to our solidarity statement. I’m signing with my name and personal contact info -- can Amazon see my name? Who’s going to have access to my information? Your contact info is confidential: we will not share it with Amazon or anyone else. We are asking for it so we can contact you with updates and to verify you work at Amazon. When at least 1,000 employees have signed the letter, we will publish the roles and orgs of all signatories, not names. We will not publish any employee names. I’m scared to sign. What are the risks? We will never share your name with Amazon or with anyone else. We will only publish job roles and orgs after we collect at least 1,000 signatures. We understand why you’re scared because we are too. We have written and signed this letter not only because we are deeply worried about senior leadership driving us into a dark future but also because we see an opportunity for our actions to ripple beyond just our company. We ourselves have been looking for inspiration, trying to find everyday people fighting to resist authoritarianism and all its insidious arms, and we realized that we can’t just rely on others to inspire or save us. We have to do our part too. Signing is a decision only you can make. Thank you for deeply considering. Why should I sign? Why does this matter? We wrote this letter because we feel a deep pit in our stomachs working at this company, knowing that our leadership is actively supporting the Trump administration and exploiting workers and the planet along the way. The AI transition, the climate crisis, and descent into authoritarianism are happening right now; Jassy and Bezos have already made it clear what they’re doing about it. We have a narrow window to demand a different path before it’s too late, and those demands will only be heard if as many of us as possible sign on and speak up together. There is too much at stake. Will this letter be released publicly? Will my name be shared publicly? After we hit at least 1,000 signatures from Amazon employees, we will publicly list all the roles and orgs of everyone who signed. We will NOT publish names. This letter will be fully public once it's released Amazon is a big company with a lot of power! What do we think this letter will do and why? We want to catalyze change, and we think amassing a number of signatures to a well-researched and well-publicized letter will do that in a few ways. It will add a much-needed dose of reality to the larger Al conversation. Right now, it seems like everyone is talking about AI, but the points in this letter are not being talked about enough. We can change that. The tide is already turning, and we’re at an inflection point; the MIT study about 95% of corporate purchases of AI failing to increase profits, and the possible deflation or even bursting of the AI bubble. It’s the right moment to start a more serious, balanced conversation. If enough employees sign and this letter enters public awareness, that may force Amazon leadership to respond in some way to our demands. We want tech workers to know that they have a voice and a stake in how AI development plays out, and that their perspectives are crucial in the fight for the future. We think the letter will encourage more conversations among tech workers at Amazon and beyond. Isn’t AI inevitable? What are some examples of workers being able to push back? SEIU in Pennsylvania established a workers council on AI. AAUP in Miami established an AI Task Force and sent out a survey asking faculty members and librarians how AI affects teaching and research—showing that AI is an issue that affects their working conditions. National Nurses United created a bill of rights regarding the use of AI in healthcare, including rights to person-to-person care and for developers to demonstrate that AI tools are safe before being used to help with patient care. And NNU has had some early victories — at USC hospitals and Kaiser Permanente — they’ve won assurances that AI won’t replace human nurses and for workers to form an oversight committee on how AI is getting used in hospitals. Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, through sustained striking and contract negotiations, won new contracts that included some protections against GenAI being used without their consent or compensation, and more worker agency in determining how they use GenAI on the job.

Title: More Than 1 Million Jobs Have Been Cut This Year, Report Says
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/11/06/more-than-1-million-jobs-have-been-cut-this-year-report-says/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByMary Whitfill Roeloffs, Forbes Staff. American companies have cut more than 1 million jobs so far this year, a new report showed Thursday, ranking 2025 among the worst years for job losses in decades as companies embrace artificial intelligence, consumer spending softens and hiring freezes take effect. Private and public employers cut 153,074 jobs in October, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a 183% increase from the month before and a 175% spike over the same month last year. More than 1 million jobs have been cut so far this year, up 65% from the 664,839 announced in the first 10 months of 2024 and 44% more than cuts made in all of 2024. The government, responsible for more than 300,000 job losses, remains the sector with the most cuts this year, followed by the technology, warehousing, retail and service sectors. Job cuts have surpassed 1 million in a year only four other times in the last 32 years: 2001 (when the dot-com bubble burst), 2008 and 2009 (in the midst of the Great Recession) and 2020 (when the COVID pandemic struck). Andrew Challenger, chief revenue officer and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, blamed the adoption of artificial intelligence, federal budget cuts, lower customer and corporate spending and rising costs for the job cuts announced in October. Last month brought the highest number of job cuts for any October since 2003, when large layoffs were announced in the telecommunications sector as cell phones gained wide adoption. "Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape," Challenger said.

The philanthropist dropped upward of $300 million on historically Black colleges and universities this fall. Campus leaders are overjoyed and spending in ways they never thought possible. By Sara Weissman You have /5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. Historically Black colleges and universities are celebrating another round of donations from MacKenzie Scott. Photo illustration by Justin Morrison/Inside Higher Ed | Raymond Boyd and picture alliance/Getty Images | Katherine Frey and Michael A. McCoy/The Washington Post/Getty Images | sshepard/iStock/Getty Images Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott showered historically Black colleges and universities with hundreds of millions of dollars this fall in another one of her signature giving sprees. HBCU leaders say the unrestricted lump sums are a godsend after decades of chronic underfunding—and they’re putting them to good use, padding previously meager endowments and funding a wide variety of technology advances, research ventures and scholarships. Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has repeatedly poured funds into often underresourced institutions, including HBCUs, as part of a 2019 pledge to give away half of her wealth in her lifetime. Her largess to colleges and nonprofits has come in waves since 2020. By 2023, her gifts to educational institutions and nonprofits exceeded $1 billion. At HBCUs, those funds led to new research centers, endowed chair positions and more aid for students, among other initiatives. Some institutions, like Bowie State University, saved and invested the money, benefiting them years down the line. Scott’s latest round of donations to HBCUs includes some whopping sums: $80 million to Howard University in Washington, D.C.; $38 million to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore; and $38 million each to Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. Scott gifted $50 million to Virginia State University, $42 million to Alcorn State University in Mississippi, $38 million to Alabama State University and $63 million to Morgan State University in Maryland, marking the largest individual gifts in their histories. The United Negro College Fund, an organization representing private HBCUs, also received $70 million from Scott toward its capital campaign to create a $370 million pooled endowment for 37 institutions. The sum, announced last month, will be distributed among HBCUs in the pool. Notoriously private, Scott has spoken little about why HBCUs have loomed so large in her philanthropic portfolio. But in a 2021 blog post, she called higher ed “a proven pathway to opportunity” and said she sought to bolster institutions “successfully educating students who come from communities that have been chronically underserved.” She also had close ties to Howard alumna and author Toni Morrison, who served as Scott’s thesis adviser at Princeton University. Scott cited everyday “acts of kindness” as her inspiration for her recent gifts in a post last month. “When my next cycle of gifts is posted to my database online, the dollar total will likely be reported in the news,” she wrote, upward of $300 million to HBCUs alone, “but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into the world this year.” HBCU leaders say that “tiny fraction” has gone far for their institutions. Scott “really understands the value that these institutions have historically made to the overall competitiveness of our country,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan State University. She’s “making transformational investments in these institutions that will enable them to continue to provide in perpetuity opportunities for students to taste the magic of a college degree that will enable them to live productive and prosperous lives.” Brent Swinton, vice president for philanthropic engagement at Bowie State University, which received a $25 million gift from Scott in fiscal year 2021, emphasized how rare unrestricted grants are for any institution, let alone HBCUs. “Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry,” he said. Scott is “single-handedly saying to HBCUs, ‘Here is an investment for those who already are getting it right but just haven’t had the same opportunities to be in the conversation with philanthropists.’” With fresh funds in hand—and the freedom to use the dollars how they choose—HBCU leaders are dreaming up new plans. Morgan State University put $60 million into its unrestricted endowment. Wilson expects that investment will generate an extra $4 million to $5 million per year for the university and its students going forward. Wilson also set aside $1 million to immediately support its most cash-strapped students. The institution reached out to 2,100 students with “severe financial need,” and already, 600 students have requested the funding to help them finish out the semester. The university has plans to create a new brain science research center as well, adding to the research centers it established with help from the last grant from Scott in 2020. Morgan State used part of that $40 million grant to win state appropriations for its National Center for the Elimination of Educational Disparities and its Center on Urban Health Equity. The university is filling those centers with “faculty members who will be churning out original research that’s coming from the perspective of researchers who really understand what some of those challenges are within our communities that are preventing the students from achieving their full potential,” Wilson said. He partly credits Scott’s gifts for Morgan State hovering on the precipice of R-1 status, the Carnegie Foundation classification for universities with very high research activity. Howard University received $80 million from Scott. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Howard University became the only HBCU to attain R-1 status earlier this year. Now, about $17 million of Scott’s donation to Howard is earmarked for its College of Medicine, to expand it and establish a new academic medical center. Howard also plans to invest in capital construction and renovation projects, including new residence halls, and to create a reserve in response to the government shutdown. Interim Howard University president Wayne A. I. Frederick said students are affected by delays in federal food benefits and layoffs and furloughs of federal employees in their families. Federal appropriations to Howard have been waylaid, as well. “We want to give students some temporary relief,” Frederick said. Spelman College’s interim president, Rosalind Brewer, emphasized that these gifts come at a time of “quite a bit of uncertainty in higher ed” as federal policy changes roil institutions. She said the $38 million to Spelman offers her flexibility in how to respond. Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry.” For example, Spelman plans to put some of the funding toward new scholarships, particularly for juniors and seniors who rely on Parent PLUS loans, which will be capped starting next year due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The goal is to close financial gaps for juniors and seniors who may struggle to pay to finish their degrees. Spelman also spent a previous gift from Scott, $20 million given in 2020, on student scholarships, as well as its endowment. “Some days, we don’t know what we’re going to face the next day,” Brewer said. The donation “gives us the confidence that, come what may the next morning, we just may be a little bit more prepared.” The gift to Spelman will also support an effort to improve classroom technology, including new tools to teach artificial intelligence skills to students. The college came out with a technology road map last month that it’s eager to get started on with the new support. An unrestricted gift “allows us to look at our strategic plan and apply it to where we know the money will work best for us,” Brewer said. “That makes this donation, quite honestly, a lot more generous than most people would realize.” HBCUs that received funds from Scott in years past say the gifts are still paying dividends. Bowie State University invested $22.5 million of its $25 million gift into its endowment. At the time, the endowment stood around $8 million. Four years later, it’s surpassed $49 million, buttressed both by Scott’s giving and other philanthropic donations that followed her “vote of confidence,” Swinton said. He noted building up endowments has been a longtime goal for many HBCUs but hard to achieve. “Endowments are not sexy, but they are lifeblood and the nest egg for an institution,” he said. “If you took all 103 HBCU endowments and added them up today, they still wouldn’t come close to any of the top 10 endowments of [predominantly white institutions].” Bowie State took the $2.5 million left over and used it to apply for matching grants from other philanthropies that it wouldn’t have had the funds to qualify for in the past. One of those partnerships enabled Bowie State to create its first endowed chair position in cybersecurity and innovation. “We look to do more of that, to be able to establish positions that will build our infrastructure, that now have a source of permanent funding, instead of being completely reliant on whatever the state budget allows” as a public HBCU, Swinton said. Frederick, of Howard University, said he also feels a lasting impact from Scott’s past gifts in 2020 and 2023, $40 million and $12 million, respectively. Those funds enabled Howard to set up the Toni Morrison Endowed Chair in Arts and Humanities and to spread the wealth, creating a $500,000 scholarship for graduates of the University of District of Columbia, a local HBCU that didn’t get Scott funds, to attend Howard’s graduate and professional programs. Howard also increased its emergency aid funding for students. Scott is “doing things so differently,” Frederick said. “It provides us with a lot of freedom to do what we need to do.” (Article was corrected to reflect UNCF's plans for a $370 million pooled endowment.) Curtailment of Laura Murphy’s research into alleged forced labor practices in China raises further questions over for Learn how institutions can use AI responsibly and effectively to advance teaching and learning.

Title: Laptop Class on Notice

Time Published: 2025-11-06T03:31:00Z

Amazon was busy this week, sending out pink slips. When it’s all said and done, this massive round of layoffs could hit up to 30,000 employees. This amounts to about 10 percent of the entire corporate workforce. The reduction in force (RIF) is expected to spread across several departments, including Human Resources, Cloud Computing (AWS), and Advertising. Moreover, this is Amazon’s largest RIF since 2022, which eliminated around 27,000 jobs. The massive layoffs have several aims. First, to address the remaining excess of the pandemic hiring spree, when online shopping boomed and Amazon doubled its warehouse network. Second, CEO Andy Jassy says he wants to use Artificial Intelligence to “do more with less.” In other words, these layoffs aren’t merely a reaction to typical economic headwinds – things like high prices or a slower market. Rather, they’re part of a structural shift for big corporations and will have permanent consequences for business, labor, and the economy. For example, massive layoffs like this at a company as enormous as Amazon are a signal that big businesses are tightening their belts. They’re looking for ways to cut expenses without hurting growth. At the same time, as tens of thousands of corporate jobs disappear, consumers will be compelled to reduce their spending. Amazon still has a market capitalization of over $2.3 trillion. These layoffs show that even the mega companies are working to conserve cash and increase efficiency by cutting jobs and replacing workers with AI. Specifically, the current strategy is to achieve growth without hiring. Amazon is not alone in this “do more with less” strategy. In fact, RTX Corporation, an aerospace and defense company, recently noted that its sales rose without adding employees. Goldman Sachs recently sent a memo to staff stating they would “constrain head count growth” to get more efficient with AI. Even Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, plans to keep its head count flat for the next three years while growing sales. Same story with UPS. The package delivery company announced this week it’s slashing a massive 48,000 jobs – 34,000 from operations and 14,000 from management – in a major effort to cut costs. This huge workforce reduction, which helped UPS beat Q3 profit expectations, is part of a plan to save $3.5 billion in 2025. A big driver for the layoffs is a massive push towards automation and AI to make operations more efficient and less labor dependent. Here’s UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes on the features and benefits of AI and automation: “You need less variable capacity, fewer leased aircraft, fewer rented vehicles, fewer seasonal workers. That allows you to run a much more efficient network.” JPMorgan Chase’s CFO Jeremy Barnum recently told investors that the bank now has a “very strong bias against having the reflective response” to hire more people. The first thought is no longer ‘hire,’ but ‘automate.’ Earlier in October, white-collar workers from Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips, or learned that they would come soon. The latest wave of generative AI is proving it can efficiently handle tasks in coding, marketing, customer support, and more. Thus, companies are using AI to staff fewer jobs. While AI is augmenting some roles, its primary corporate function right now is a swift reduction in payroll… One of the key takeaways from Amazon’s layoffs is that the increased use of AI is not just for assisting, but for replacing. The layoffs are a direct result of Amazon’s massive investment in AI, which is now explicitly framed as a job eliminator. In this regard, Amazon CEO Jassy already told employees that the increased use of generative AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” in the next few years, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change.” Jassy is putting his money where his mouth is. For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, with most of that dedicated to AI and cloud-computing investments. Yesterday (October 30), following market close, Amazon released its third quarter 2025 earnings results. Of note, AWS segment sales increased 20 percent year-over-year to $33 billion. Amazon has also been automating its warehouses using Blue Jay, an impressive system of robotic arms combined with AI systems, which will significantly reduce the need for warehouse laborers. Per the announcement from Amazon: “Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball—only here, the “balls” are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed. It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.” Blue Jay also doesn’t call in sick, take lunch breaks and vacation days, or require the company to contribute to an employee 401(k) match. This is but one example of the endless types of automated, worker replacement, AI applications that are being rolled out. Blue collar and white-collar workers alike should be worried. AI is coming for their jobs. But what choice do companies have. Now that the AI cat is out of the bag, its implementation and use are required to compete. Amazon’s value is now fundamentally tied to its AI aptitude. After reporting slower cloud growth than competitors earlier this year, its shares fell 7 percent. But this proved to just be a slight setback. As part of yesterday’s Q3 report, Amazon “added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months – more than any other cloud provider.” This sent the after-hours share price skyrocketing by over 13 percent the last we saw. Simply put, AI has moved from a shiny new tool to a serious factor when executives are making headcount decisions. The future is looking lean, and it’s being powered by algorithms! Amazon CEO Jassy’s aggressive push into generative AI means a slimmer corporate workforce is on the horizon. This is an all-encompassing push to replace human tasks with tools like AI agents built on services such as Amazon Bedrock. The impact is already being felt across Amazon’s white-collar departments. In Tech and AWS, the goal is to massively speed up development. AI is being deployed to write code, summarize information, and tackle research. The Bedrock platform itself allows developers to create powerful AI agents that execute complex workflows, essentially automating traditional software roles. In the process, white-collar jobs are eliminated. Human Resources – everyone’s least favorite department – is also a prime target. Layoffs have already hit the department as Amazon seeks to automate administrative work. Generative AI is now handling automated resume screening and shortlisting. AI-powered assistants are taking over common employee queries and training support, cutting the need for human administrators. AI is also taking over Advertising and Content creation. It can instantly write new marketing copy, draft social media posts, and create realistic images for campaigns. This transition proves that AI is rapidly automating the “laptop class” jobs that were once considered safe. When the industrial revolution took root, workers moved from the farm to the factory. When factory jobs were offshored over the last 40 years, the next generation of workers moved to the office. Now, with the burgeoning AI revolution taking over both factory and office jobs, where will these workers go? Is there room for them all on the government dole? Can AI somehow turn unemployment into funemployment? Certainly, as AI automates routine work, it will also create an entirely new set of jobs. Prompt Engineers, for instance, are needed to effectively communicate with AI. There’s also the need for AI Trainers to perfect the models. Perhaps a whole suite of new jobs will soon appear to fulfill the promise of AI. Yet for workers who received pink slips this week, those jobs better come soon.

Title: Anxious about AI job cuts? How white-collar workers can protect themselves - starting now

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. What's been a hard 12 months for professionals just got tougher. Fears over the increased use of AI to complete white-collar roles have been compounded by news of layoffs. If you're a mid-level professional, it's tough not to feel anxious about the future of work. In a memo to staff last week, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said her company's decision to cut 14,000 corporate roles was aimed at "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources." Also: AI struggles to cite results properly. Can Perplexity and Getty's new partnership fix that? The news from Amazon is the latest in a series of layoffs by big businesses. Experts believe one significant factor affecting the fast-changing job market is AI. Earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could be responsible for eliminating half of all entry-level white-collar jobs -- while spiking unemployment to 10-20% -- in the next one to five years. However, while AI is fundamentally altering the nature of white-collar work, professionals can take steps now to reduce their anxiety and prepare for the future. First, said Bev White, executive chair at technology and talent solutions provider Nash Squared, professionals must be honest. Examine your role and make a genuine assessment of how at risk it is from AI, now or in the future. "Think about what transferable skills you have, the core human skills that machines can't replace, and where they can be applied," she told ZDNET, suggesting professionals should research the market, network with contacts, and look for opportunities. "Work hard on how you present yourself and communicate your core strengths, to make yourself highly visible both within your own organization and to others." Also: A minority of businesses have won big with AI. What are they doing right? That approach resonates with James Carney, associate professor at the London Interdisciplinary School, who told ZDNET that we're entering an era where neither technical training nor AI competency will guarantee employability. "Instead, the differentiator will be how well people can use AI thoughtfully and how they apply their own judgment, creativity, and ethics alongside the technology," he said. Education will be a crucial component for professionals who want to future-proof their skills. To that end, Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight, told ZDNET that professionals should retrain, reskill, and rescope their roles. "Think of AI like online banking when it arrived -- you learned the basics because it became the default," she said. "Do the same here by getting comfortable with writing clear prompts, checking outputs, and documenting what you did. That's the new baseline." Also: 4 ways to turn AI into your business advantage Rotibi also encouraged professionals to learn about data ground rules, such as where models fail, and guardrails, including the General Data Protection Regulation, audit trails, and sector policies. Finally, Rotibi suggested a principle for the digital age is that AI training should be a right, not a perk. If employers want to achieve generative AI assistant-level productivity, they should invest in access, time, and clear guardrails. "Workers should feel entitled to ask for and expect accredited courses, safe sandboxes, and clear policies, backed by government and education providers," she said. Amazon's job cuts could be indicative of several larger trends that professionals should be aware of. Rotibi said the cuts represent a shift in the work that the company considers important. AI is speeding things up, so Amazon wants fewer people coordinating and more people building technology, which explains why some office roles are affected. AI is both the tool that reduces some jobs and the magnet that pulls money and new roles into chips, power, and platforms. Also: Adobe might've just solved one of generative AI's biggest legal risks She also stressed that Amazon's cuts are part of a broader IT industry trend, with companies such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce reshaping teams, trimming middle layers, and redirecting spend toward AI platforms and data centers. Other professionals outside IT are also subject to cuts. In its analysis of Amazon's job cuts, "The Wall Street Journal" pointed to UPS reporting last week that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. "White-collar work is being reshaped, not erased," Rotibi noted. "The center of gravity is shifting from coordination to designing, integrating, and governing automated systems with fewer hand-offs and more ownership of outcomes." For professionals who will be anxious about these workplace changes, it's important to recognize that AI isn't the only explanation for the reshaping of white-collar work As Karim Morgan Nehdi, CEO at consulting and training specialist Herrmann International, suggested to ZDNET, the IT layoffs should be seen in the context of broader macroeconomic challenges. "They're about AI arriving at exactly the wrong economic moment," he said, with some of the challenges including over-hiring during the pandemic, weakening economies and tariffs, and continued geopolitical instability. "Companies facing higher costs and investor pressure needed a compelling efficiency narrative, and AI handed them one on a silver platter." However, and most crucially for professional staff, Nehdi also recognized that these layoffs feel different -- and that divergence, whatever the explanation, is due to the potential longer-term impact of AI on professionals. Research by Herrmann, in collaboration with MyPerfectResume, compared ChatGPT's cognitive profile with that of 2.5 million professionals across 800 jobs. The analysis found that ChatGPT's thinking style closely aligned with professions that rely on decision-making under pressure. Also: Is AI making it harder for new college grads to get hired in tech? Professions most cognitively similar to ChatGPT include colonels, cardiologists, and -- crucially for many readers of this article -- IT managers, with each profession sharing an alignment of over 93% with the AI's analytical thinking profile. "Our research shows that AI's cognitive overlap is highest with work we once thought was safe from automation: analytical, structured tasks that have defined many white-collar roles," he said. The conclusion, added Nehdi, is simple: "The 'safe' white-collar jobs just became a lot less safe." For anxious IT professionals concerned about the ongoing influence of AI, that warning sounds a bit like a death knell for white-collar work. However, various experts told ZDNET that it's important to put fears over AI-enabled job losses into context. Also: No ROI in AI yet? Try these six proven tactics for creating real business value First, said Nehdi, emerging technology has uneven superpowers. While AI can write code effectively, it struggles with interpersonal and visionary tasks, such as empathy, creative improvisation, and reading the room, which are capabilities that define human advantage. He said those flaws are good news for white-collar workers: "This means there's no clean 'AI replaces X profession' story. It's messier and more interesting than that. Second, and adding further complexity to the trend alluded to above, Richard Corbridge, CIO at property specialist Segro, told ZDNET that, while the march toward AI offering efficiency in some roles is valid, the pathway toward how this impact will play out is unclear. And while the recent job cuts will raise anxieties among white-collar workers, Corbridge said AI could have a positive impact on workplace roles in the longer term, as younger professionals adapt and adopt the capabilities that will define future success. Also: Are you part of 'the great stay'? Here's what experts say is behind this latest job trend For professionals, therefore, the key is to embrace change. As Nash Squared's White concluded, there is no doubt that AI will impact some white-collar jobs, but that doesn't mean there is nothing you can do about it. "Be a pathfinder, not a victim," she said. "It is on all of us to keep ourselves relevant and current. It's something I always advocate for. Set aside time to invest in yourself. Your future self will thank you for it."

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 6, 2025 / 8:13 AM EST / CBS News As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year — the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy. The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a "jobless boom." Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs. "This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook," Zhao told CBS News. "It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well." At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted. "You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine — profits are doing great," he said. "We've never seen anything like that." For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire," meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers. The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP. By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring. "Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. "While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP." The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available. Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said. "You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too," he said. "So that creates a very odd equilibrium." Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies. Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword. "These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up — it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs," he noted. But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said. "People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'" he said. "I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'." Edited by Alain Sherter © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. How many jobs are being lost to AI? A new bipartisan bill would require US companies to report AI-related job losses to the federal government to track the technology’s impact on employment. On Wednesday, Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act, which "will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce—what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging," Sen. Warner said in a statement. "Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind." Although researchers have already floated estimates about jobs lost to AI adoption, the senators say it's vital to start tracking the issue with concrete data. The bill proposes requiring both public and private companies in the US, as well as government agencies, to report AI-related job losses on a quarterly basis to the Department of Labor. This would cover jobs lost to automation and the use of artificial intelligence to replace human labor. Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

IBM is set to cut thousands of jobs in November and December as part of a workforce rebalancing strategy aimed at repositioning the company in the era of AI. The cuts come just months after the company claimed it is “focused on American jobs” with plans to invest in manufacturing. The Wall Street Journal reports that IBM has announced that it will lay off a small percentage of its global workforce before the end of the year. The tech giant, which employed around 270,000 people worldwide at the end of 2024, did not provide an exact figure for the number of employees affected by the cuts. Even a one percent reduction in staff would impact almost 3,000 white-collar professionals. An IBM spokesman stated, “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need. We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” IBM joins a growing list of companies, including Amazon, UPS, and Target, that have recently announced significant layoffs. These cuts are largely driven by a shift in corporate strategy towards embracing AI tools and emphasizing efficiency among employees. As AI continues to advance, many companies are investing heavily in building out the necessary infrastructure, such as data centers, to support these technologies. The layoffs at IBM come at a time when the company is striving to establish itself as a leader in the development of quantum computing. In competition with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as numerous startups, IBM is working on larger clusters of quantum chips that it believes will enable large-scale computing within the next five years. Breitbart News previously reported that IBM claimed to be “focused on American jobs and manufacturing” when it announced a $150 billion investment over the next five years: IBM revealed in a Monday press release that it “plans to invest $150 billion in America over the next five years to fuel the economy and to accelerate its role as the global leader in computing.” “This includes an investment of more than $30 billion in research and development to advance and continue IBM’s American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers,” the company said. IBM CEO and Chairman Arvind Krishna added, “Technology doesn’t just build the future — it defines it.” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently shared that the company has already used AI agents to replace the work of several hundred human resources employees. This move has allowed the company to redirect resources towards hiring more programmers and salespeople, highlighting the potential of AI to streamline certain business processes and enable strategic workforce allocation.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Layoffs are sweeping the corporate world as companies restructure around AI and automation. From Amazon to Target, major employers are slashing thousands of jobs as they race to restructure around automation and efficiency. On Tuesday, IBM became the latest company to announce it would cut thousands of workers by the end of the year as it shifts focus to high-growth software and AI areas. And for Gen Z the news might hit especially hard. Just last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna had positioned himself as a rare optimist amid widespread job cuts, pledging that his company would increase hiring among recent college graduates. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that.” Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but maintained that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” An IBM spokesperson told Fortune that the latest round of layoffs would impact a “low single-digit percentage” of the company’s global workforce. And, when combined with new hiring, it would leave the company’s U.S. headcount roughly flat. IBM did not specify how many workers would be affected or which departments would be hit. The company employed about 270,000 people at the end of 2024, meaning even a 1% cut in the workforce could affect some 2,700 workers. “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need,” the spokesperson added. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” Although it’s unclear which teams—or generations—will feel the blunt effects of the cuts, entry-level roles have borne some of the biggest impact from AI so far. Researchers at Harvard University found that junior employment has declined sharply at firms adopting AI. For professionals—whether they’re trying to break into the job market or rebound from a layoff—finding a job can feel like an uphill battle. After all, job postings have been on a gradual decline since their peak in March 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Krishna’s advice? Focus on developing the right skills for the AI age. “Skills of people are really important,” he told CNN. “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.” Hiring experts echo that view, saying that firms across industries are looking for candidates with AI experience—especially those familiar with the tools already in use internally. “Companies would rather hire a candidate who has hands-on experience with a particular tool they are implementing if they have the ability and interest to train up on other skills,” Alyssa Cook, a senior managing consultant at hiring and staffing firm Beacon Hill, previously told Fortune. A report released by Microsoft and LinkedIn last year found that 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills, as compared to a more experienced one without them. But even beyond technical know-how, experts say the right mindset can make the biggest difference. “We’re not just looking for people who know the tools,” Alejandro Castellano, CEO of automation firm Caddi, previously told Fortune. “We’re looking for those who are curious, adaptable, and thoughtful about how they use AI. That mindset makes the biggest difference.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The Supreme Court is now weighing President Trump's broad tariffs, challenged for potentially exceeding presidential authority and creating economic instability for small businesses. Lower courts have sided against the president, and the nation's highest court will decide the legality of these import taxes, enacted under emergency powers. A decision is expected by July.
