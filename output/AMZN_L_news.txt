By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: You might not have heard of Ritchie Ordonez, but she’s quietly become among the most important players in European streaming. Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain.

However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents…’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make Prime Video “a first-stop entertainment destination,” as Ordonez calls it. Meanwhile, Fallout has been hit in most EUX territories thanks to the strong gaming cultures in the countries. “That makes us very excited about more of those gaming franchises like Tomb Raider and God of War coming to the service,” says Ordonez. Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Reacher, Anne Hathaway romcom The Idea of You and The Summer I Turned Pretty have all proven popular, along with German hit Maxton Hall: The World Between Us, which has been killing it on the platform and highlights a growing desire for European content, according to Ordonez. To that end, Prime Video recently launched Spanish zombie horror Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End (aka Apocalipsis Z: El Principio Del Fin), and it performed strong in the EUX countries. In Turkey, Korean series Marry My Husband, which was co-produced with local streamer TVING, landed well. “These programs are really starting to travel,” says Ordonez. On the movie front, she notes, “A lot cinemas haven’t bounced back in the way they would have liked post-Covid, and supporting that sector is important.” This means working with local exhibitors, distributors and producers, and being flexible enough to give films theatrical windows when needed. “During Covid, we had a lot of films that we had to launch direct-to-streaming just by virtue of there being no cinemas open, and we’ve seen the outcome on both of those methods,” says Ordonez. “We don’t see any cannibalization, frankly, when we have theatrical launches. In fact, a lot of those titles bring in new customers, even if they have a TVoD window on Prime Video. It’s so fragmented and people have so little time, but there is still a massive audience to tap into, and so we’re open to any of those models. Producers are excited about having that theatrical presence and that works, but other titles have gone direct-to-streaming and that’s been successful, too.” Looking ahead, Andrew Bennett is set to replace Barry Furlong at the head of Amazon Europe’s Prime Video teams. Prime Video VP of International Kelly Day said recently the long-serving Bennett, who is relocating from the U.S., would bring acumen in “content acquisition, partnerships and business development, marketing, and product/tech” to the role. Ordonez isn’t commenting ahead of the change, but it’s understood Prime Video Europe is taking a ‘business as usual’ approach before Bennett’s vision for the business takes shape. What she will say of 2025 is that she expects her key challenge to be “keeping up with the volume, and trying to figure out the models.” There could be more opportunistic deals such as the Viaplay agreement to add scripted to the slate, to offset “risky and expensive” original production, while on the unscripted front she points to how local versions of LOL have led to contestants landing Prime Video specials and building out their personalities. “That has really captured the local culture,” she adds. “If in 12 months’ time we can say the growth has continued and we’ve added to the slate with local originals, that would be a success, along with growing the channels and TVOD,” concludes Ordonez. “Getting the content right is the most challenging thing — you don’t have a lot of shots at that. We have to be thoughtful about it and we’re learning from all of the things we’ve launched.” Ordonez and co will soon get the chance to apply that knowledge to the next stage of EUX’s lifecycle.

Title: Sonos plans return-to-office push for its product teams

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Sonos will soon encourage employees on its various product teams who live near its US office locations to come in for at least two days per week, The Verge has learned. That’s a notable break from the company’s history, throughout which Sonos has enthusiastically supported fully remote and hybrid work. Job listings at Sonos routinely state that “it’s about impact, not location.” Glassdoor reviews have long backed this up, with employees reporting no pressure to come into the office. But that lax stance is set to change slightly as Sonos continues its effort to right the ship following this year’s app mishap and stay on track with upcoming products. It’s adopting a stricter policy that will call for product employees within proximity of Santa Barbara, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco to regularly be present at those offices. The Santa Barbara location is where Sonos is headquartered. The company also currently operates international offices in Paris and the Netherlands “Flexibility has been a core tenet of how Sonos has operated since our founding. Flexibility is not going away, but like many companies, we are evaluating the impact that in-person collaboration has on the effectiveness of our teams and our culture,” Sonos said in a statement provided by spokesperson Olivia Singer. Do you know more about what’s ahead at Sonos? The company is rumored to be working on a video streaming box. As with headphones, I’m curious how Sonos plans to differentiate itself in this category. If you have anything to share on what’s happening at the company, I can be reached securely (and confidentially) via Signal at chriswelch.01 or (845) 445-8455. “Sonos product teams rely heavily on collaboration, collective problem-solving, and hands-on testing. These are activities which we believe can be done more effectively in-person. We will be prioritizing office space for our product teams to collaborate in-person 2+ days per week depending on location (proximity to office), role, and current needs. Many Sonos employees and teams, however, will see no change to their current work situation.” Employees at Sonos tell me that morale remains low internally — it’s been that way since the app controversy spiraled into a crisis — with some fearing another wave of layoffs in the coming weeks after 100 employees were cut back in April. New job postings from the company have been extremely thin in recent weeks as Sonos tightens its belt amid sluggish demand. During last month’s quarterly earnings call, CEO Patrick Spence and CFO Saori Casey said Sonos will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the balance sheet where it needs to be as the audio company navigates a challenging period for its business. Those measures already include leaning more heavily on AI to field customer support requests. The new Sonos Arc Ultra has received positive reviews across the board, including from yours truly. But a single product hasn’t gone far in convincing rank-and-file employees (or the company’s most ardent customers) that Sonos is back on the right trajectory for the long haul. Return-to-office mandates have become common across the tech industry; many large companies require employees to badge in at least three days each week. Amazon made waves earlier this year when it announced a return to the traditional five-day office work week. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: GM is killing Cruise robotaxis

😮 The 50 greatest innovations of 2024: From mosquito clothing to an inflatable bike helmet 😮 By Mack DeGeurin Posted on Dec 11, 2024 General Motors is officially ending its support for Crusie’s beleaguered fleet of self-driving “robotaxis.” In a surprise announcement this week, the US carmaker said it will “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to end robotaxis and instead focus on eventually creating an autonomous personal vehicle. Cruise, which previously operated as a subsidiary, will now be fully absorbed by GM. That’s all a major departure for the driverless car company which had its sights set on offering paid robotaxis rides in multiple cities next year. Cruise previously proclaimed it planned to have close to a million of its autonomous vehicles flooding US streets by the end of the decade. In the end, safety concerns and a bungled 2023 California rollout may have left the company with wounds too deep to ever fully heal. GM revealed the news via press release Tuesday afternoon. The carmaker cited growing costs and increased competition as the primary drivers for the change. The company said it would have required “considerable time and resources” needed to properly scale the robotaxi business up to make it viable. Cruise vehicles were still being tested in multiple cities this week. Now, as part of GM, Cruise will work on improving GM’s “Super Cruise” driver assist features in its lineup of vehicles. GM says the decision to end its robotaxi business could save the company $1 billion per year. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “You have to understand the cost of running a robo taxi fleet, which is not our core business and is very expensive,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts first reported in The New York Times. Cruise, which maintained one of the largest robotaxi operations in the US, was primarily competing against Alphabet-owned Waymo, which already offers thousands of paid driverless rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles every day. Amazon-backed Zoox, currently testing in multiple cities, is also expected to launch its robo taxi operation in Las Vegas next year. Though Cruise’s robotaxi dreams are effectively dead, GM said it’s still holding out hope for a fully autonomous personal vehicle. The immediate focus, however, seems to be on more restrained (and less controversial) advanced driver assist systems (ADAS). “As the largest U.S. automotive manufacturer, we’re fully committed to autonomous driving and excited to bring GM customers its benefits–things like enhanced safety, improved traffic flow, increased accessibility, and reduced driver stress,” GM senior vice president of software and services engineering Dave Richardson said in the press release. The news reportedly came as a shock to Cruise engineers, several of whom told TechCrunch they heard about the news at the same time as the media. Others told the outlet they were “blindsided” by the change of focus and are expecting layoffs as a result. Employees speaking with TechCrunch suspect the cuts could impact non-engineering roles like government affairs and remote assistance teams that were operating in Houston, Phoenix, and other test cities. GM did not immediately respond to our request for comment but noted in its press release that it was working with Crusie to “restructure and refocus” the unit’s operations. A spokesperson from GM said it was “too early to provide specifics” regarding layoffs. The company expects the restructuring to be complete by mid 2025. [ Related: Why are ‘driverless’ cars still hitting things? ] The surprise decision comes after Cruise has spent the better part of a year trying to repair a damaged reputation. After years of research and development, Cruise was finally granted approval to begin operating its robotaxis in San Francisco in August 2023. But within days, reports surfaced of Crusie vehicles blocking traffic, running through stop signs, and swerving to avoid people on the road. That rough rollout inspired immediate push-back and criticism from activists, some of which attached traffic cones to the hoods of cars to fool Cruise sensors and immobilize them. All of the pressure reached a boiling point in October 2023, when a pedestrian was hit by a vehicle and flung underneath a nearby Cruise vehicle. The robotaxi dragged the pedestrian for 20 feet before finally pulling over. University of San Francisco Professor and autonomous vehicle expert William Riggs previously told Popular Science that tragic mistake was likely the result of Crusie failing to consider placing sensors capable of detecting humans underneath their vehicles. “There wasn’t a camera underneath the vehicle, the engineers couldn’t see somebody was there,” Riggs said. “It was truly something that no one had ever thought of.” The California DMV revoked Curise’s license to operate in the state following the dragging incident. That led to the swift resignation of then CEO Kyle Vogt. Not long after that, the company laid off 900 employees, or around 24% of its workforce. After months in the dark, Cruise attempted to begin to bounce back this year. The company reportedly received $850 million in support from GM over the summer to help relaunch testing operations in Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. Just three months ago Cruise announced a partnership with Uber that would have reportedly let ride hailers access its robotaxis through the Uber app in several cities next year. That’s no longer on the table. Ultimately, Cruise was never able to fully recover from its botched San Francisco rollout. Polling shows drivers are still concerned about driverless vehicle safety and the repeated missteps did little to alleviate those worries. Cruise also backtracked and ceded ground to Waymo, its primary competitor, at precisely the wrong time. Waymo is already offering thousands of paid trips every day and expanding operations to more cities next. In hindsight, it’s unclear whether or not Cruise would ever be able to close that distance and release a taxi that could meaningfully compete with Waymo and other deep-pocketed rivals.

Title: Google Might Start Layoffs In January Claims Post On Online Message Board

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Google employees are worried that they might be laid off next year as the firm has allegedly increased its target layoffs for the lowest performers, according to unverified posts on an employee board. According to posters, managers at one of the biggest technology companies in the world have tightened the criteria for letting go of employees even amidst productivity growth among Google engineers. Google, like its tech peer Microsoft, has struggled to match the stock market performance of the top performers in 2024 due to regulatory concerns revolving around its search engine business. The posts follow Google parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call, in which CFO Anat Ashkenazi shared that she would like to reengineer the firm's cost base further. Google parent Alphabet generates most of its revenue from its search engine and advertising businesses that hold a tight grip on the industry. Consequently, with the firm engaged in legal battles with the Justice Department, investors have been wary of investing in its shares. The stock's troubles have also been due to the early stage of AI investing being focused on hardware providers - or just NVIDIA. While Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates for revenue, earnings and sales from major business divisions, they also revealed $13.72 billion in traffic acquisition costs (TAC). These were higher than analyst estimates of $13.53 billion, with the figure coming at a time when advertising revenue grew by 10% annually and search revenue jumped by 12.3% year-over-year. The subsequent post-earnings call was also the first time Alphabet's new CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, got an opportunity to outline her strategy during earnings. Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet after spending more than two decades at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, revealed that she planned to "build on" previous efforts to streamline "operations across the company through the use of AI." Amidst this backdrop, a post on the online message board Team Blind claims that Google will start laying off employees in January. According to the poster, the firm has increased its "lower buckets" to 10% from an earlier 8%. These buckets are of low-performing employees who might be let go. The Google employee believes that since Google's output has increased to "an average of 500 code changes a year" finding these low performing employees is easier than before. They add that simply being a low performer might not be an adequate reason for an employee to be laid off. Instead, the poster believes that other factors such as being on the wrong project or on management's radar for low-performance can also lead to someone being let go. Their post made three days ago, was met with skepticism and additional facts by employees from Google and other firms. Another Google employee who claims to work in the firm's Cloud business claims that the target layoff percentage for Google Cloud is 6%. Employees of Amazon and Capital One claim that the percentage at their organizations ranges from 6% to 15%. Additionally, Google employees on a separate post were also worried about layoffs, but others also joked about non-verifiable information on the Internet. Worried questions from employees at an all-hands meeting in November followed the Alphabet CFO's comments at the earnings call. As reported by CNBC, Google's vice president of recruiting, Brian Ong, confirmed that the firm was "hiring less than we did a couple of years ago." Google's layoffs in 2023 generated widespread fury after reports of long time employees being let go without warning. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

General Motors has announced it will no longer fund its Cruise Robotaxi program, effectively shutting it down. The automaker will fold Cruise employees into existing teams and prioritize its driver assistance system, Super Cruise, instead of robotaxis. “Consistent with GM’s capital allocation priorities, GM will no longer fund robotaxi development work given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market,” reads the press release. High costs and accidents have plagued Cruise, while its biggest rival Waymo has continued to see success. GM, which currently owns 90% of Cruise, will increase its ownership to 97% and eventually acquire the remaining shares. Cruise's shutdown will also save GM $1 billion a year, according to the company. Cruise staff told TechCrunch they were "surprised” and “blindsided” by the decision, learning about the transition at the same time as the media. Sunsetting Cruise could take several months, and GM has not yet said if any layoffs will occur as a result. Cruise has had a tough time since October last year, when one of its robotaxis ran over a woman in San Francisco. Following the incident, the California DMV suspended Cruise’s license, forcing the company to halt operations nationwide until it had regained public trust. Further, the company recorded a loss of $3.48 billion in 2023 and was fined $500,000 last month for providing false records on the San Francisco crash. It's unlikely Cruise's deal with Uber, which was announced back in August, will still move forward now that Cruise is shutting down. PCMag has reached out to Uber for comment on the status of this program. As Cruise disappears, other AV firms are expected to press on with their robotaxi plans. Tesla has announced its robotaxis, which may hit the road in 2025, and Google-owned Waymo has continued to expand its service. And Amazon-backed Zoox got approval last month to drive its robotaxis (which don't have steering wheels) on the streets of San Francisco. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Two separate rulings on Tuesday stopped the merger of supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons in its tracks. The decisions by U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson and Judge Marshall Ferguson echo widespread concerns about potential negative impacts on competition and consumer choice, affecting millions across the country. Judge Nelson, presiding in Portland, Ore., issued a preliminary injunction after a detailed three-week hearing. Nelson pointed out the likelihood that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is challenging the merger, would succeed in proving that the $24.6 billion deal would substantially lessen competition in the market. The preliminary injunction seeks to preserve the status quo until an in-house administrative judge at the FTC can further assess the merger’s implications. Hours later, in Seattle, Judge Ferguson issued a permanent injunction, specifically prohibiting the merger within the state, citing it as a clear threat to maintaining competitive market conditions. His decision reflects a concerted effort to protect consumers and workers in Washington state from the potential consolidation harms that could arise from such a colossal merger.

(Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) “We’re standing up to mega-monopolies to keep prices down,” Ferguson said. “We went to court to block this illegal merger to protect Washingtonians’ struggling with high grocery prices and the workers whose jobs were at stake. This is an important victory for affordability, worker protections and the rule of law.” The merger, first announced in 2022, has faced scrutiny from federal and state regulators. The FTC’s lawsuit, supported by attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia, argued that merging Kroger and Albertsons would not only reduce consumer choice but also drive up prices and dampen wage competition in the grocery sector. In response to the court’s decisions, representatives from Kroger and Albertsons expressed their disappointment and are currently considering their next steps, which could include appealing the rulings, NBC News reported. (RELATED: More Americans Turning To Discount Grocer As Prices Skyrocket) “We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs, and enhance customers’ shopping experience. We are carefully reviewing the Court’s opinion and are evaluating our options in accordance with the merger agreement,” Albertsons said in a statement. Both companies have defended the merger as a strategic move to better compete with retail giants such as Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, The Associated Press reported. Albertsons even said that blocking the merger could lead to dire consequences, including layoffs, store closures and an exit from several markets. Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons planned to divest 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to alleviate overlapping market concerns, AP said. The Biden administration initiated a legal challenge in Feb. 2024 against the Kroger Company and Albertsons Companies, Inc. merger, arguing that the $24.6 billion deal stifles competition. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,” Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the release.

Title: Tech Workers Are Flocking To Financial Services

As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language ... [+] processing and large language models is growing. As artificial intelligence increasingly serves as a key driving force in business strategies across all sectors, this shift is altering the labor market, allowing technology workers to explore opportunities beyond their traditional industry. The tech job market, while more tempered compared to recent years, remains robust in the financial sector. Major banks are actively pursuing talent, attracting a significant influx of skilled professionals to their ranks. While tech firms continue to be the primary employers of recent tech graduates, the financial services industry is gaining ground. At Cornell University, the proportion of computer science graduates entering the financial services sector increased from 16% in 2022 to 22% in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College saw a rise in the percentage of master of information systems management graduates choosing careers in financial services, from 16% between 2018 and 2021 to 19% between 2020 and 2023. This sustained demand for tech expertise in banking reflects the industry's ongoing digital transformation, which provides technologists with opportunities to develop patentable innovations. Generative AI has the potential to create substantial value across the banking sector, including wholesale and retail segments. The fast-emerging technology is projected to contribute an additional $200 billion to $340 billion in value to the industry, according to McKinsey research. In addition to AI, financial institutions are also investing heavily in areas such as blockchain and cybersecurity, necessitating a continuous pipeline of specialized talent. In 2024, the tech industry faced a challenging landscape, with more than 525 companies cutting approximately 150,000 positions, according to Layoffs.fyi. This widespread reduction in headcount is further exacerbated by the growing risk of conventional tech roles becoming outdated or diminished due to the advancement of AI. The Bay Area, which is the leading tech hub for major corporations and startups, experienced a significant wave of job cuts in its technology sector during the second quarter of this year, due to changing market conditions and economic pressures. Tech companies disclosed intentions to cut over 7,000 positions in the region, as reported by Mercury News. The 7,062 job losses marked the most substantial quarterly reduction since the first quarter of 2023, when the industry eliminated more than 10,000 roles in what was previously thought to be the height of tech layoffs. The latest national employment data shows limited movement in the tech workforce. According to the November jobs report from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the tech unemployment rate slightly decreased to 2.5%, matching the lowest level recorded in 2024. However, employment in the tech sector remained largely unchanged, with a marginal decline of 1,636 jobs during the month, an analysis by CompTIA, an organization specializing in IT certification and training, revealed. In stark contrast, emerging professionals view the financial sector as the most promising career path in the current economic landscape. A 2024 Global Graduate Outlook Survey by CFA Institute, a not-for-profit organization that provides finance education, found that 30% of respondents identified financial services as the sector they have the most confidence in, marking a six percentage point increase from 2023 and maintaining its top ranking for the second consecutive year. As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language processing and large language models is growing. Consequently, employers are placing a greater emphasis on AI skills in their recruitment strategies. Recent EY research indicated a surge in corporate AI investments, with widespread adoption across surveyed companies, as 95% of senior leaders report ongoing AI investments. Notably, there's a substantial increase in high-value AI commitments, with the percentage of companies planning to invest $10 million or more in AI expected to nearly double from 16% to 30% in the coming year. Goldman Sachs projects that global AI investments will approach $200 billion by 2025. Capital One and Bank of America secured positions among the top 15 companies obtaining AI-related utility patents, joining prominent technology firms such as Toyota, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and IBM, according to patent consulting firm Harrity & Harrity. Moreover, Citigroup expanded its workforce by adding 8,000 technologists between 2022 and 2023. The bank had previously announced its intention to aggressively hire around 2,500 tech professionals in 2020, including coders, engineers and data analysts, to enhance its trading and investment banking divisions. Additionally, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Well Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are deploying AI and machine learning within its businesses. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Sonos Arc Ultra review: don’t call it a comeback (yet)

By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Sonos really needed a great product right now. 2024 will be remembered as the year that Sonos nearly torpedoed its brand with the haphazard, premature rollout of an overhauled mobile app. This led to an unprecedented outcry from loyal customers who faced myriad bugs, diminished system performance, and other issues. Many called for CEO Patrick Spence to step down. That didn’t happen, but Sonos has spent the majority of this year on the back foot with apologies, turnaround plans, and assurances that a setback of this magnitude will never happen again. It’s under these undesirable circumstances that Sonos has released the briefly delayed Arc Ultra soundbar. The $999 Ultra is designed to improve on what was already a very capable Dolby Atmos soundbar. After many hours testing the Ultra, I can say it resoundingly succeeds. Software missteps aside, Sonos can still deliver on hardware. The Ultra is a notable improvement in basically every regard, and a worthwhile upgrade — if you’re ready to trust Sonos again. The original Arc arrived during a high point for the company that its executives must desperately miss, back when demand for its products was soaring amid the covid-19 pandemic. The Arc was a strong performer that delivered an impressive level of immersion from a single soundbar, though some customers experienced a loud popping sound caused by a bug that took the company far too long to fix. The Arc had other weaknesses, with bass response at the top of that list. Unless you paired the Arc with a Sub (or the Sub Mini that came later), the soundbar didn’t have enough low-end bite to make you feel the booms and reverberating explosions in Hollywood blockbusters. It’s a downside shared by many soundbars and an inevitable tradeoff that comes with the form factor. In 2022, Sonos spent $100 million to try and overcome that by acquiring a small company called Mayht Holding, which had developed a “revolutionary approach to audio transducers” that allowed them to be smaller and lighter without compromising on sound. The Arc Ultra is the first time we’re seeing that technology in an actual product. It’s being used for a new “SoundMotion” woofer built into the soundbar that produces twice as much bass as the original Arc. It’s a cool-looking thing, and here’s a TL;DR on how it works from Sonos’ press kit: - Distributed lightweight motors displace more air for added bass. - Aerospace-grade aluminium ribs connect the motors for combined power, allowing a smaller enclosure. - Four pairs of opposing magnets power four voice coils for bigger sound in a smaller enclosure. - Reinforced force-cancelling cones minimize vibration for clearer sound. This compact, relatively flat woofer design freed up enough space for Sonos to cram even more drivers (14 in total) inside the Arc Ultra. The original Arc had 11. Such an arsenal of speakers is good enough for the Ultra to deliver a 9.1.4 surround experience. That’s what Sonos’ marketing claims, at least. Don’t get hung up on the numbers; several of those are virtualized phantom channels, and this is still a soundbar at the end of the day. What’s objectively true is that the Arc Ultra produces a soundstage that’s noticeably wider and more dynamic than its predecessor. And it does so in a cylindrical enclosure that’s similar in size and overall design to the original, though this one’s a bit shorter — nice if your TV is on a stand like mine — and slightly longer. The touch controls have been relocated to an upward-facing panel at the rear of the soundbar, with the Arc Ultra now sharing the same button layout as the Era 100 / 300 and Move 2. Hands-free voice commands also remain, though Google Assistant is no longer available. You can use Amazon Alexa, Sonos Voice Control, or both simultaneously. One welcome upgrade is a Trueplay feature called Quick Tune. Like other recent Sonos speakers, the Ultra can use its built-in microphones to tune itself for your environment — without requiring the manual Trueplay process of moving around the room while waving your iPhone around. This means Android users can finally take advantage of Trueplay, or at least this faster version of it, which wasn’t possible on the first Arc. iPhone owners still have the option of doing a more thorough tuning like before. I didn’t notice a meaningful difference between the two, but you might, depending on your room layout. Bluetooth audio playback is also supported on the Ultra after being MIA on the original Arc. There’s a pairing button at the back of the soundbar beside the ethernet jack and microphone mute switch. AirPlay 2 is still on board, and the Ultra makes the jump to Wi-Fi 6 for more dependable wireless performance. Something Sonos hasn’t addressed is the lack of HDMI passthrough. Other premium soundbars let you plug in a game console or disc player without sacrificing another HDMI port on your TV, but Sonos clearly favors simplicity here. I tested the Arc Ultra in three different setups: first by itself; then with the also-new Sub 4 ($799); and lastly with the Sub 4 and a pair of Era 300 speakers as rear surrounds. Even on its own, the improvements over the original Arc are obvious and plentiful. The Sound Motion woofer delivers on its promise, giving the soundbar more oomph and a thicker low end that will likely be more than enough if you’ve got a small to medium-sized living room or are living in an apartment with people below you. Putting bass aside, the Ultra simply has greater clarity, dimensionality, and depth than the Arc. The height effects are more convincing, and everything sounds more expansive without getting thin or too dispersed. I was as captivated by The Wild Robot at home as I was seeing it at an Alamo theater. The Ultra beats out the Arc for music, too. Whether it’s Atmos tracks like Kacey Musgraves’ “Sway” or regular stereo, Sonos’ Sound Motion tech and the added drivers make a difference. I still do most of my music listening elsewhere given the choice, but for relaxing on the couch, this does the trick. Dialogue clarity is also fantastic and the other major reason to consider upgrading from the Arc. Even without enabling the speech enhancement feature, which now has three levels to choose between, the center channel is more impactful. I could clearly hear Christian Bale’s voice over the roar of engines in Ford v Ferrari. Guy Ritchie’s Snatch is an old favorite (and good test for dialogue intelligibility), and it posed no problems for the Arc Ultra. Bringing in the Sub 4 levels up the bass from good to stellar. This configuration also allows the soundbar to concentrate on treble and midrange frequencies, while the dedicated subwoofer takes care of rumbling bass. And yes, if you throw in the pair of Era 300 speakers, you get the full Sonos Dolby Atmos experience. It’s blissful and can be downright mesmerizing, which is what I’d hope for from a bundle that costs over $2,500. If you’re interested in digging into frequency response charts, check out Andrew Robinson’s great YouTube review. Whether used solo or as a package, Sonos has a winner on its hands that can outshine the best from Samsung and other brands. But none of that matters if you can’t rely on the software that controls everything. So, what about the beleaguered new app? My experience during this review was surprisingly headache-free. None of my speakers randomly vanished from the system, and controlling the Arc Ultra was responsive and worked as intended. Adding the Sub and surrounds went off without a hitch. It was all very encouraging, but I fully understand that some people are still having a frustrating time with the app. And new problems continue to arise: early on, there was a Trueplay bug with the Arc Ultra that nerfed bass response. That’s since been resolved, but Sonos needs to keep the performance enhancements and bug fixes coming into the new year and well beyond. Just recently, I’ve seen numerous complaints about a bug that’s badly hampering the Era 300’s surround sound performance — and this affects owners of the original Arc, too. Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the Sonos Arc Ultra, you must agree to: Using Amazon’s Alexa assistant also means agreeing to Amazon’s Alexa terms of use. Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one or more optional agreements. The Arc Ultra is an excellent product and a crucial step in the right direction. It’s a significant improvement over the original and easily in contention for the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy. But this is only one step, and whatever comes next will be the true indication of just where Sonos is headed. If the rumors of a video streaming box are true, Patrick Spence and Co. better have a compelling justification for moving beyond Sonos’ core audio business. The damage from the app episode will be lasting, and it has already led to layoffs and rendered the Ace headphones all but forgotten in less than a year. After going through this ordeal, I wouldn’t blame anyone for holding off on the Arc Ultra until Sonos proves it’s capable of making good decisions again. The company isn’t out of the woods yet. Not even close. But it still knows how to make a damn good speaker, so there’s hope.

Title: The Omnicom-IPG megamerger signals a new era for the ad industry

Hello. Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate, has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday and initially faced local gun and forgery charges. Our team has been covering this developing story — keep up with our coverage here. In today's newsletter, the $13 billion Omnicom-IPG megamerger reflects a new era as Big Tech and AI upend the ad industry. What's on deck: But first, a new ad-venture. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's already been a big week for the ad industry. Omnicom Group said it had reached an agreement to acquire Interpublic Group, a merger worth more than $30 billion that would create the world's largest ad conglomerate. Across the pond at Paris-based Publicis Groupe, the party hats might be staying in the drawer. Just last week, Publicis recruited Snoop Dogg for a video to help celebrate the firm usurping London's WPP to become the world's largest ad holding company. But it's not just about being No. 1. For ad industry insiders, the proposed takeover reflects an ad sector under threat from Big Tech and AI, writes Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. By creating a larger company, Omnicom-IPG will have a bigger base to deploy data and technology, which could give it leverage to secure beneficial and exclusive deals with partners such as cloud providers. Keep in mind, however, that in the short term mergers can be highly disruptive. Concerned clients. Bruised egos. Job cuts. Integrating two companies with 100,000 people combined, dozens of different agency brands, and hundreds of offices across the globe will not be a simple task. There will likely be synergies — including job cuts. "It will be harder to climb the career ladder. Superstar creators and creatives will also be in demand, as well as good strategists, in all disciplines. But, lots of other roles will become diminished," Simon Francis, who leads the marketing consultancy Flock Associates, told BI. However, as Lara highlights, that could create opportunities for smaller agencies, especially as the merged company works its way through the disruption caused by integration, egos being knocked out of joint (it wouldn't be the first time), and potential client conflicts where the new entity suddenly works with two or more fierce rivals in the same sector. "From an M&A perspective, it's only going to add fuel to the fire." That's according to William Ritchie, founding and managing director of advisor firm WY Partners. "I'd expect there is going to be more competition for the best assets and more focus on building a streamlined data and tech-first offering which can compete," he told BI. Private equity has been circling the ad industry, too. Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone have shown interest in media and entertainment. Industry insiders have speculated for months that WPP could be taken private — or at least some parts of it could be. The Insider Today team: Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG could usher in a new, inevitable M&A wave

Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 That’s one hell of a way for the agency holding companies to end the year. Just as everyone was looking to slow down and take a holiday-induced break before what will be a turbulent 2025, along comes Omnicom with a proposed stock-driven acquisition of Interpublic Group. The two CEOs — Omnicom’s John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky — shared on their conference call Monday morning to announce the deal that they have been discussing this combination for the better part of a year. Suffice it to say that, should the deal clear regulatory and shareholder approvals — (those CEOs are hoping it will clear in the second half of 2025) — the combined $30 billion revenue will give the industry the equivalent of a megalodon shark in a sea of great whites and hammerheads. Lest we forget, megalodon went extinct because it was simply too big. So before panic sets in too significantly for the likes of WPP, Publicis and Dentsu, and the myriad independent agencies that have made a living feeding off the fish that the sharks don’t eat, this kind of bigger isn’t always seen as better. But to hear Wren and Krakowsky tell it, this merger makes more sense today than ever. They have their eyes on the Googles and Metas of the world. So much that Krakowsky referred the combined company as a platform rather than a holdco. “Being a part of what is now a platform, essentially a company with exceptional talent and reach and capabilities, and knowing that you can bring those to bear for your client, or that they’re going to give you an opportunity, as John [Wren] says, to build a more interesting career — there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it inside our organization,” he told analysts and reporters on a Monday morning conference call with Wren and both companies’ CFOs. The combined entity would become by far the largest holding company in the communications world, with an expected cash flow of more than $3 billion, according to the information provided by the companies. The principals also cite the complementary resources and geographies. A few examples: But the truth is, both companies needed to do this. Of the six sources reached for this story, all noted that IPG has not had a good stretch the last few years, having lost Amazon, General Motors and several other large and small clients that outweighed its gains. Two sources even said they see Omnicom’s acquisition as a bit of a bailout. “I think this is a very welcome distraction from what has been a disastrous year for IPG,” said one executive outside both companies, who declined to speak for attribution. Added David Jones, CEO of Brandtech Group, a rival to both holdcos: The acquisition “makes huge sense in the short term — both have been having their lunch eaten by Publicis, and IPG declined last year in organic growth. This gives both of them a story for their shareholders. It gives the merged company the ability to carry out financial re-engineering and restatements that will help the numbers look better in the short term.” Ouch. Meantime, the union doesn’t come cheaply. In the Monday conference call, Wren cited $450 million in “one-time cash cost” to close the deal and achieve $750 million in “cost synergies” — which includes layoffs among the 100,000 employees of both holdcos. Oddly, Wren did add, and employees of both companies should take note: “Any employee listening to this, if you’re associated with any revenue stream at all, you’re gold, don’t worry about it.” Observers of the deal don’t think things will end up quite so magnanimously for staffers, particularly those in back-office roles. “This deal will no doubt create a lot of uncertainty for staff and clients on both sides,” said Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “Notwithstanding the cost synergies (and implications this will bring), clients will be considering how their requirements will be met during an extreme period of transition and transformation.” How is the rest of the agency world affected? For one, it will most likely set off a chain reaction of M&A, because no other holding company can stay put as they are. “I expect to see more M&A activity on the back of this deal,” said Kangisser. “It’s easy to forget there are a number of very well funded, and highly acquisitive challenger groups who will look to fill this vacuum and provide clients with greater optionality.” “Start looking at all these other combinations,” said another high-level agency executive who declined to speak on the record. “The other guys are going to have to do something. I think this is the starting gun for major, major consolidation.” Every source reached for this story had their own scenario that could unfold. WPP, which has just been leapfrogged in size and scale, has long been the subject of breakup rumors. Havas just got spun out by parent company Vivendi, making it easier to pick by the likes of, say, Accenture or Dentsu. And Publicis, which analysts see as neck and neck with Omnicom in its success in the marketplace, isn’t likely to be left in the dust, despite already having acquired Influential and Mars United Commerce earlier this year. Nor should Omnicom itself be precluded from other purchases. Wren said the the $3 billion in cash flow would allow the company to continue to be acquisitive. For independents who have staked their claim to being the antidote to the holdco system and process, Christmas seemingly has come early. The deal “provides the independents the room to be able to articulate their propositions,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester. “Their counterpoint is skill, and this just helps frame their proposition of being able to balance the buying scale that they’re accumulating with the performance scale that they’ve developed.” And how will clients feel about this? Amazon just left IPG and gave some of its media business to Omnicom. Will this stir up unhappiness? Wren and Krakowsky poo-poo’d any notion that clients will have a problem with the acquisition. Jay Wilson, an analyst at Gartner, noted that the size of client will impact how much they’re affected. “It’s unlikely any single client will see an immediate impact on its relationship with existing IPG or Omnicom agencies, and those with large relationships at a holding company level will probably see the slowest transition — for example to a new hold-co wide data spine like IPG’s Acxiom,” said Wilson. “Clients of single agencies within these networks may be the first affected, if and when the new organization decides to merge individual agencies, as many hold co’s have been doing in recent years.” There’s been a lot of speculation about the value of Acxiom to Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG, but an ongoing court case over the data warehouse adds another layer. How Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of IPG keeps marketers guessing. The acquisition is expected to yield $750 million in annual cost synergies within two years.

Title: Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview:
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-3761136

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Title: Computer science grads say the job market is rough. Some are opting for a 'panic' master's degree instead.

A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

Title: Life after Google: 8 laid-off employees reflect on being let go, what they did next, and their advice for others

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.
