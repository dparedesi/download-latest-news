Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. As a channel, it remains key to growth for many retailers. But the era of the DTC brand as we know it is over. In 2019, DTC brands Casper, Away and Glossier were touting $1 billion-plus valuations, all of them reaching that threshold within five years of being founded. They were riding high on cheap capital, a strong economy and the hype the direct-to-consumer model had generated. The next couple of years would see Casper go public, alongside retail darling Warby Parker and sustainable footwear brand Allbirds. At the same time, all three trumpeted big plans for brick-and-mortar footprints and category expansion, and touted the strength of the DTC model. It seemed DTC brands could do no wrong. Then, things changed. Casper was sold to private equity just two years after it went public, Allbirds announced store closures and a shift to a “more profitable” distributor model globally, and Outdoor Voices abruptly shuttered its fleet of stores before being snapped up by the same firm that owns Draper James. “Everyone believed the mantra should be DTC or die because they wanted to eliminate the middle person and make more money,” Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, said. “What they finally realized was: No one eliminates the middle person, they simply become the middle person, and that brings its own set of costs. So for a period of time, people became so obsessed with where they sell rather than what they sell that they lost track of who they were.” Precipitous sales declines at former disruptors, including those buoyed by the pandemic like Peloton, became somewhat of a norm. The bike company and its peers also grew steadily more interested in other sales channels, including Amazon and more traditional wholesale partners. The more established brands that had jumped on board the DTC bandwagon when it was chugging along also began pulling back, recognizing some of the same challenges, and the allure of purely DTC brands faded. “If Allbirds had remained on its strong growth trajectory, if Peloton had maintained the growth tear it was on, the models probably wouldn't have pivoted that much. But they did change — and both companies fell into difficulties,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said, noting those challenges pushed both brands to expand their sales channels. “Now that genie has been let out of the bottle, it's not going to be put back in.” Even brands like Lululemon, which sells mostly DTC, have wholesale accounts, Saunders noted. “The term DTC is still used as a shorthand. I'm just not quite sure it's all that relevant now,” he said. Asked if we’ll still be talking about DTC brands in five years, Siegel put it more bluntly. “In a derogatory, backwards-looking fashion? Sure.” As the direct-to-consumer model matured, a slew of factors that helped DTC brands flourish began waning. The general retail market slowed, customer acquisition costs on social media surged, venture funds dried up, the cost to fulfill online orders grew and brands started hitting their own growth ceilings. “There's a lot of things that moved and shifted in a relatively short period of time that meant that DTC went from being almost the darling or the hero of retail, to being a channel that had a lot of challenges and problems,” Saunders said. “And had a lot to prove that it wasn't necessarily, in some cases, proving.” The model itself was flawed from the start, according to Siegel, whose firm has done multiple reports on the impact selling direct-to-consumer has on key metrics like gross margin. Critically, Siegel found that brands pivoting to direct did not see a relative increase in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating profit or operating margin. “It just didn't happen. Back then, obviously, that was controversial — and it triggered a lot of fights,” Siegel said. “But now people are looking at the results and they're acknowledging wholesale, when done right, is truly a powerful thing.” “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly.” Neil Saunders Managing Director at GlobalData Some up-and-coming brands, including Vuori, may have dodged some of the growing pains in the sector by embracing wholesale from the start. Founder Joe Kudla has said before that the company saw a place for key wholesale partners from the beginning of its business and touted those relationships as part of the reason it was able to achieve profitability. “The partners we selected at the start in the U.S., and those we work with today globally, are very intentionally picked, and our distribution is deliberately limited to only the best accounts,” Andy Lawrence, vice president of international at Vuori, said via email. “While I wouldn’t say wholesale insulates any brand from all DTC challenges, at Vuori, it does add a critical component to our success. Wholesale, if done correctly, allows brands like us to connect authentically with the local customer.” Still, for a time many DTC brands simply didn’t invest in wholesale as a channel because selling directly to consumers was working. And investors were enthusiastic about funding DTC brands, profitability challenges or not, because capital was cheap and consumers had disposable income to spend on new brands and discretionary products. “There was so much money sloshing around, it was very difficult to do badly,” Saunders said. But in a more discriminating market, the value proposition of some of retail’s startups became far more important — and was often found wanting. Expensive exercise bikes and fancy sheets are harder to sell in a more risk-averse economy. “It's very important not to confuse problems with DTC — which, there are problems — with problems with the brand,” Saunders added. “Allbirds primarily has a brand problem. It doesn't really have a distribution problem, as such. So Allbirds could push itself into more stores, do more things — it's still not going to resolve the issues of the company because the problem is with the product and the position and the brand, it isn’t with the distribution method.” As startups and traditional brands alike recognize the limits of DTC, many are embracing a more measured model that values both DTC and wholesale. The sensibility of that approach has been touted frequently over the past few years as brands have moved away from strictly digital approaches, with one report earlier this year saying wholesale is still the most profitable investment channel for brands. "People chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets Matt Katz, a managing partner at SSA & Company, describes what’s happening now as a “reset” driven by overinvestment in DTC and underinvestment in stores. The importance of stores and wholesale is now sending investments back in the other direction, and retailers are unlikely to lean back into DTC as hard as they did — that is, unless investors start funding it again. “Silly as it sounds, people chase simplicity when it seems to be intuitive. This is not the first time, and it certainly will not be the last time, that everyone chased a buzzword,” Siegel said. “When companies don't need to be profitable, profit and loss statements are not scrutinized. When companies don't need to be profitable, expenses are not scrutinized. That makes it much easier to chase a hope and a belief versus being held accountable for the actual results.” The swing to DTC — and the correction since then — has taught both brands and wholesalers some important lessons. Take Nike, for example. The rise of DTC brands spurred a huge investment from the sportswear giant in its own digital capabilities and stores, and at the same time caused Nike to cut ties with a slew of wholesale partners it deemed less important to its overall strategy. First, that led to exceptional growth. Then came a retraction, as Nike determined it had taken things too far and, in fact, did need those wholesale partners after all. Throw in layoffs, a cost-savings plan, a lawsuit surrounding the success of the DTC strategy and an abrupt CEO swap and you have a pretty good summary of the fallout to date. “DTC serves a lot of Nike customers, but it doesn't serve all of Nike's customers. A lot of product discovery, a lot of buying of Nike products is done by people who might go into a department store, especially some of the older age cohorts,” Saunders said. “These people are not going to go online directly to Nike. They want to buy it through the channels that they shop in. And if Nike disappears or pulls back from some of these channels, they lose the sales — it's as simple as that. And they underestimated that. They were almost a little bit arrogant as to the power of the Nike brand.” And make no mistake, Nike is a powerful brand. A $50 billion-a-year brand. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” Matt Katz Managing Partner at SSA & Company But as Nike was learning its lessons, both good and bad, about DTC, its wholesale partners were also learning theirs. Foot Locker, one of the retailers Nike spurned and is now again seeking closer ties with, has unveiled its own turnaround actions to lure brands to its shelves, including revamping two-thirds of its Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores over the next few years. Macy’s, too, which received similar treatment from Nike, has been undergoing store refreshes at its go-forward locations as it looks to keep customers and brand partners coming back. “I think that the wholesale side really had to pull its socks up as well,” Saunders said, noting that retailers like Macy’s and Foot Locker have realized they are “serving two masters” now. “‘One of our masters is the consumer, but the other master is the brands. Because the brands don't have to be in our store necessarily and what we've got to prove to them is that we're a worthwhile partner.’” Indeed, while the pendulum has swung back toward wholesale, some brands are still moving away from certain retailers and could continue to do so if their partners don’t serve them well. Levi’s in its Q3 earnings report touted that its wholesale business now makes up less than 20% of its revenue, down from 30% in 2015. Analysts at the time pointed to Levi’s sales and profit growth as a sign that its DTC strategy is working, at least for now. “I think we've moved from retailers having the advantage. The retail-brand wholesale relationship used to be heavy, heavy retail. That was your point of distribution and the retailer chose which brands were most important, right?” Katz said. He noted that the balance shifted when brands developed their own access to customers through DTC. Now, Katz says, the consumer is in charge. “Consumers have taken over the leverage point and they are buying on availability and price and experience.” That means brands need to focus on being wherever the customer wants to buy, which might sometimes be wholesale and might sometimes be DTC and might sometimes be Amazon. "It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator." Simeon Siegel Managing Director at BMO Capital Markets During the height of DTC mania, companies like Nike and Adidas became very focused on what percentage of their revenue was DTC versus wholesale. Nike had a goal of upping DTC from 40% of its revenue to 60% by 2025, while Adidas aimed to reach a 50% DTC split by the same time period. Even with wholesale coming back in vogue, there is no universal answer for what that split should be, according to Siegel, and brands should be adjusting those percentages based on their individual needs. Having a strong DTC business also doesn’t have to come at the expense of wholesale. For Vuori, having wholesale partners has helped it gain brand awareness in new markets like the U.K. and Japan. “From that initial interaction, we then begin to see these newcomers start to interact and shop with us via our DTC channels too,” Lawrence said. “The omnichannel approach, including wholesale, is our best answer for how to expand in a profitable, brand accretive way.” DTC and wholesale have different strengths, according to Siegel, with DTC theoretically offering first-party data, higher margins, greater control over the brand and greater connection to consumers, while wholesale ideally gives brands a partner with experience distributing products economically and efficiently. “It became a battle,” Siegel said of how brands began approaching DTC and wholesale a few years ago. “It became a battle of players within the ecosystem — who could edge out their collaborator, as opposed to a holistic partnership where all sides could win.” A case could be made that the battle is largely over now, with hybrid models being embraced across the industry and wholesale-brand relationships becoming more collaborative. But what does all this mean for future brands? While most analysts agree that a hybrid model is the future, they also tend to agree that DTC will continue to be important for retail’s newest entrants. The channel is easy to set up and has lower initial costs, which makes it ideal for upstarts, but as the era of DTC brands fades, retail could also see more brands launching with partnerships already in place. When Vanessa Hudgens relaunched her beauty brand Know Beauty, for example, she did so with Amazon. And beauty brand Pretty Smart entered the market through an exclusive deal with Walmart as well as its own website, even working with the mass merchant to develop its product line prior to launch. “I think you'll see some of these brands may launch with very small strategic partnerships that give them their presence,” Katz said. “And if you can prove that the brand has staying power and pull, then you'll see continued investments in flagship real estate models.” That could range from pop-ups to permanent stores or limited geographic partnerships with retailers, Katz said, but regardless, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on how quickly a brand can grow its points of distribution. Some up-and-coming brands already offer prime examples of this: Actor Millie Bobby Brown launched her fashion brand at Nordstrom within months of its debut online. While they took slightly longer to branch out, intimates brands Skims and Savage X Fenty have both also pursued wholesale relationships, including internationally, in addition to their DTC channels. Pursuing wholesale partnerships isn’t without its challenges, though, particularly for young brands. “The problem with wholesale is you will go into a company and you will say to that company, ‘Look, I want you to stock our product’ and the first thing they will say is, ‘Our shelves are full,’” Saunders said. “So it's very difficult to break through. And then when you do break through, for a younger company, there are a lot of issues that you have to resolve. You have massive working capital requirements because if you're a brand-new brand and you're trying to get into a Walmart — even if Walmart agrees to take you into a fraction of the stores that they have — guess what? Your volume is terrific and most companies don't have the manufacturing capacity.” The model of the future may look a lot more like that of running brands Hoka and On, which have both surged in popularity recently and have benefited from strong DTC sales and also a healthy presence in wholesale. “You will get businesses that start off in both ways, but I think what is fortunate is … we've moved on from simply condemning a channel,” Siegel said. “There's no such thing as a bad channel. There are bad partnerships and there's bad execution.” Another challenge for new brands, according to Saunders, is the simple fact that “there’s a lot of stuff out there” already. Any startups in retail now have to make it through a noisy landscape and offer a valuable enough proposition to gain shopper interest. Identifying as a “DTC brand” just doesn’t much matter anymore. “We went through an era where companies identified themselves, and were known by others, by the outside world, based on where they sell, not what they sell. That's silly, right?” Siegel said. “Are you an apparel retailer? Are you a mattress retailer? Are you a connected fitness bike brand? Or are you a channel? … The idea of where you sell should always be a very important part of your business decision making. But it should not be who you are. You should not aspire to be a DTC brand. You should aspire to sell something special and figure out how to reach your consumer in the most economic, healthy, brand-appropriate way. I think, fortunately, we've moved a lot closer to that.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts From economic pressures weighing on consumers to relocating stores away from malls, here’s what’s on retailers’ minds heading into the new year.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Collective fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.” — Bertrand Russell, Unpopular Essays Number of the Week: 95% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week discusses the complexity of the sun and part of what we do not know. It presents the abstract of a paper by Donald Rapp who is concerned about rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Also discussed are the false notion of settled science, questionable classification of subsidies, rising electricity rates in the US, the use of the term unprecedented, and the questionable optimism of a recent report by the IEA, ********************* The Mysterious Sun: The Sun and the relationship between Earth and Sun are the dominant characteristics of climate change. According to the mathematical model developed by Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch three types of cyclical patterns describe how the Earth revolves around the Sun: According to a NASA website, each cycle has a different duration. Changes in eccentricity vary between 0.0034 (almost a perfect circle) to 0.058 (slightly elliptical) and the duration is 100,000 years. The eccentricity explains why seasons are different lengths. In the Northen Hemisphere summers are longer than winters. Changes in obliquity, tilt, are described as 41,000-year cycles. The tilt varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees from a North Pole – South Pole axis. And changes in the direction Earth’s axis is pointed (a wobble) is described as a 26,000-year cycle. According to the NASA Science Editorial Team. “Milankovitch’s work was supported by other researchers of his time, and he authored numerous publications on his hypothesis. But it wasn’t until about 10 years after his death in 1958 that the global science community began to take serious notice of his theory. In 1976, a study in the journal Science by Hays et al. using deep-sea sediment cores found that Milankovitch cycles correspond with periods of major climate change over the past 450,000 years, with Ice Ages occurring when Earth was undergoing different stages of orbital variation. Several other projects and studies have also upheld the validity of Milankovitch’s work, including research using data from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica that has provided strong evidence of Milankovitch cycles going back many hundreds of thousands of years. In addition, his work has been embraced by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Scientific research to better understand the mechanisms that cause changes in Earth’s rotation and how specifically Milankovitch cycles combine to affect climate is ongoing. But the theory that they drive the timing of glacial-interglacial cycles is well accepted.” Many researchers have proposed that not well understood changes in the Sun influence Earth’s climate in terms of years and decades. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators dismiss changes in the Sun as insignificant. The private CERES-Science team proposes that Sun’s energy has changed over the last 45 years in a paper published by the Astrophysical Journal: “Multiple New or Updated Satellite Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Composites (1978–2023).” The CERES-Science team has posted the entire dataset. The entire dataset is often missing in some of the critical work that the IPCC uses such as the Mann, et al. hockey-stick. The abstract of the CERES-Science paper reads: Several total solar irradiance (TSI) satellite missions have been carried out since 1978. None of these missions have lasted more than one to two solar cycles (SCs), and each mission implies a slightly different absolute TSI baseline. Nonetheless, several satellite composites have been developed by compositing satellite data from different missions to form an almost continuous daily record for the satellite era. However, disconcertingly, each mission has implied slightly different changes in TSI between consecutive solar minima and solar maxima. Some groups have developed adjustments to individual missions that have substantially reduced these differences. Others prefer to use the original data published by the satellite science teams. Some TSI composites average together conflicting records, while others prioritize specific records over others. Here, we compare four existing composites to 17 new alternative series based on the available satellite data. These 21 TSI series are statistically sorted into six groups of three to four series each. We found that the six groups suggest different intercycle trends between solar minima. We compare the groups to eight daily resolved solar proxy-based TSI reconstructions and to daily sunspot numbers. Excellent agreement is obtained over one to two SCs, but significant differences are observed over longer timescales for each group. Therefore, we have assembled all these time series (old and new) into a large and new TSI data set for use by the scientific community. Versions scaled to 1 au (for studying solar variability) or in situ values at Earth (for studying solar/terrestrial interactions) are provided at daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions. The principal author, Ronan Connolly, has posted a video explaining this work. He explains that there are three hypotheses regarding sunspots and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI): Connolly concludes that based on satellite measurements all three are partly right and partly wrong. Generally, for one year data, the higher the sunspot number the lower the TSI. For ten-year data, the higher the sunspot number the higher the TSI. This paradox illustrates the complexity of the issue, and the need to examine all the solid data available and not limit the examination to specific time periods. Adding to the complexity is that occurrence of large bright areas on the sun accompanying small dark sunspots. These cannot be observed with ordinary method because the sun is too bright and can only be observed when dark lenses are used. The bright regions are called solar plages or bright floccule or chromospheric faculae. The chromosphere (sphere of color) is the second layer of the sun’s atmosphere above photosphere (the outer shell from which light is radiated) and below the solar transition region and the corona (the outmost layer). Connolly asserts bright floccule (solar plages) accompanying sunspots increase TSI more than the sunspots decrease TSI. Does the bright floccule, sunspot activity and TSI relationship remain the same over most solar cycles? We don’t know. This has been an ongoing debate since the late 1990s. There appear to be two different solar cycles and the TSI is different in each solar minimum. However, relying on the sunspot record is not good enough, and an increase in TSI may contribute to global warming. Further, the shortage of data from the satellite record is a problem prior to 1996. The question is which record since 1996 is most reliable because each satellite record shows slightly different behavior. There have been different types of adjustments to the satellite data with the adjusted data known as the PMOD adjustments showing almost an exact linear relationship between sunspots and TSI from 1978 to 2013. This adjustment requires a correction to the Nimbus 7 data for the instruments to become more sensitive. Douglas Hoyt, head of the Nimbus 7 team, stated that the Nimbus team was unable to find any physical change to justify the adjustment or any change in the method of calculating the results. (The abstract of one of his papers can be found at: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91JA02488 Connolly discusses that the CERES-Science team provides a new way to look at satellite data – updating past composites and providing additional ones to bring the total to 21. They brought them into six separate groups and calculated the average of these six groups. Five groups are significantly different than one group close to the PMOD calculations which the IPCC uses. The principle researcher of PMOD is now dead and Connolly is reluctant to directly address the methods of calculation because the principle researcher cannot reply. From the work of the CERES-Science team, one can appreciation how complex it is to understand the changing complexity of the principle driver of Earth’s climate. To say the science of Earth’s climate is settled is absurd. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Concern about CO2: Donald Rapp is an accomplished physicist. According to his biography on Amazon, Rapp has: “over 60 years of technical research experience. He was a full professor at the University of Texas and spent over 30 years at Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In his early career he worked in chemical physics, producing a dozen citation classics with up to a thousand citations, and textbooks on quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Later, he worked on spacecraft technology leading to his book “Human Missions to Mars”. Since about 2006 he has worked mainly on climate change, ice ages and human missions to Mars. His positions on many key issues are contrary to mainstream trends. In particular, he is highly doubtful that life ever existed on Mars and thinks the NASA Mars Program is a boondoggle. He is also skeptical of alarmist claims regarding the dangers of global warming, but he is concerned about rising CO2. At age 88, he is still going strong with a new book coming out in February 2023.” The fourth edition of his book Assessing Climate Change: Temperatures, Solar Radiation and Heat Balance was published in November 2016. Donald Rapp informed Ken Haapala that his new paper addresses current climate change: “Estimate of Temperature Rise in the 21st Century for Various Scenarios.” The abstract reads: “The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a lengthy report on climate change in early 2023. This report hypothesizes five potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to the end of the century (2100) and estimates the global average temperature gain in the year 2100 from the mid-1800s for each scenario. The method of calculation in the IPCC report is obscure. The results are merely stated. The present paper provides a clear method for estimating the temperature gain each year from 2015 until 2100, along with yearly estimates of ppm of CO2. To facilitate the calculations, a set of scenarios of future emissions was chosen that is analogous to the scenarios used by the IPCC but is more amenable to computation. The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015. If it is assumed that the amount of warming per gigaton CO2 from the past persists into the 21st century, then future warming in the 21st century can be estimated for any assumed future scenario of CO2 emissions. This paper provides a simple and clear estimate of yearly CO2 ppm and temperature rise from 2015 to 2100 since the 1800s for a set of scenarios that cover the likely range of future emissions.” An honest scientist, Rapp states the key assumption: “The basic assumption in this paper is that most of the temperature gain from the mid-1800s to 2015 (1.15 C – as reported by the IPCC) was due to rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and a relationship is thereby derived between warming and gigatons of CO2 emitted for the period: 1800s to 2015.” To TWTW the lack of comprehensive data and the tremendous uncertainties involved make it impossible to test this key assumption. The uncertainties and the inability to test key assumptions in the many assertions involved in climate change are the principle reasons why TWTW focuses so heavily on understanding the greenhouse effect, even though it evolves a field of physics that is distant from classical physics. As discussed in last week’s TWTW, the scale and dimensions involved are far different. The issue is important because fossil fuels which increase atmospheric CO2 are needed for reliable, affordable electricity. Perhaps one day they may be replaced by nuclear energy, even fusion. But that day is not today. For Rapp’s accomplished paper, see link under Defending the Orthodoxy; for last week’s discussion of importance of scale see https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2024/TWTW%2010-26-2024.pdf *************** Settled Science? One of the exaggerations made by climate alarmist is that the science is “settled.” Charles Rotter of WUWT points out a new paper that terrestrial plants absorb 31% more CO2 than previously calculated. Rotter writes: “The discovery that plants absorb 31% more CO₂ than we thought reveals just how far off the mark climate models—and the policies based on them—can be. It’s not just a matter of revising a few numbers; it’s about rethinking the entire narrative of ‘settled science.’” If verified, this will require a recalculation for the “settled science.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** What Are Subsidies? Proponents of wind and solar have long claimed massive subsidies to fossil fuels and often included dubious arguments that the depletion allowance is one such subsidy. The depletion allowance is similar to depreciation of an asset, they both lessen the value of the asset. Writing for the UK Daily Sceptic David Turver provides a solid economic analysis of what is a subsidy and what is not. He states: “In simple terms, a subsidy is when the Government pays (or mandates consumers to pay) for an activity to occur that otherwise would not happen if the market were left to its own devices. Examples might include grants to theatre companies or awarding CfD [Contract for Difference] contracts to offshore wind. When it comes to oil and gas, the definition of a subsidy becomes a little controversial. The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines fossil fuel subsidies as ‘measures that reduce the effective price of fossil fuels below world market prices.’ It is certainly true that some countries, such as Russia and Iran, do subsidize hydrocarbons according to the IEA’s definition.” Turver provides a graph by IEA showing the Value of fossil-fuel subsidies by fuel in the top 25 countries, 2022. The US, UK, and Germany do not appear. Leading the list are Russia, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Turver provides an analysis comparing UK Fossil Fuel “Subsidies” and Taxes [paid] 2022. This shows the subsides amount to about 24.8 billion pounds while the taxes amount to about 49.8 billion pounds. In 2024 the expected subsidies are about 0.2 billion pounds while the taxes are expected to be about the same. It would be interesting to see such an analysis for the US, particularly the subsidies to solar and wind power compared to the taxes paid. For California, the results would be ridiculous, especially if the value of electricity, delivered or not delivered, is also calculated. On summer sunny days solar power in California often generates more power than needed and nothing in the evening when needed the most. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Rising Electricity Costs: Writing for Master Resource, Bill Peacock gives a grim analysis of rising electricity costs in the US, by grid sectors. He writes: “During the first three years under Biden vs. last three under Trump, average wholesale electric prices in the seven U.S. independent or regional service areas have increased by 72%. Retail prices are also higher. The average 2024 U.S. residential rate to date is 24% higher than in 2020. For all end users—residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors—prices are up 23%. This rate surge reflects the massive renewable energy subsidies authorized in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed by President Biden, which tripled the outlay of such federal largesse. Another factor is the administration’s natural gas policies, which banned imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal; joined with the European Commission to reduce Europe’s dependance on Russian oil; and put a pause on LNG permits. Natural gas combined cycle, the technology of choice in a free market, is as cheap as ever, representing the path not taken. Whether it is the unprecedented subsidies for renewable energy or the unprecedented war on American energy, the Biden administration’s policies are behind the increase in America’s electricity prices. Wholesale Prices Up 72% Wholesale electricity prices are the best indicator of the direction of electricity prices. State regulations on retail prices often shield consumers from immediate exposure to rising energy prices. Eventually, though, consumers will bear the full brunt of higher wholesale electricity costs either through higher retail electric prices, lower income, or higher prices for other goods and services.” “ERCOT, which covers most of Texas, had the highest average wholesale price over the last three years at $117. It also had the highest three-year increase at 208%. ISO New England had the second highest average price at $81, followed by California ISO at $80. CAISO also had the second highest three-year price increase at 81%. New York ISO was next averaging $68, although prices in New York City were considerably higher at $80.” Peacock gives a table showing estimates of U.S. Federal Energy Subsidies, 2020-2029: Renewables $244,874,000,000; Fossil Fuels, 22,474,000,000; Nuclear $19,116,000,000. He then states that: “From 2010 through 2019, solar received $82 per megawatt hour of electricity generated. That is 42 times the amount of subsidies per megawatt hour nuclear received, 112 times coal, and 211 times oil and gas. For wind, its multiples were 10 times nuclear, 26 times coal, and 48 times oil and gas. The ‘free’ wind and solar generation actually cost taxpayers $74 billion last decade in federal subsidies, without including the cost of the electricity or state and local subsidies.” This analysis shows the government subsidies to wind and solar are not the path to reliable, affordable electricity. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Unprecedented: A characteristic of yellow journalism and climate propaganda is the use of the term “unprecedented.” Heavy rains fell in the Valencia region of Spain, and immediately mainstream media shrieked “unprecedented.” The volume of water involved was not unprecedented, but due to human settlement in flood plains and increasing prosperity, the loss of human life and property may have been. According to an article in Reuters, the phenomenon known locally as DANA may have been the cause. DANA is a Spanish acronym for high-altitude isolated depression, and unlike common storms or squalls it can form independently of polar or subtropical jet streams. See links under Changing Weather. *************** Optimism v. Reality: The International Energy Agency (IEA) came out with the World Energy Outlook 2024 that TWTW finds unrealistic in assessing the replacement of fossil fuels with alternatives such as wind and solar. Among other issues, the problems of the unreliability of wind and solar have not been addressed. Storage of electricity is a vexing problem, and the only proven large scale storage is pumped hydro replenished by reliable fossil fuel or nuclear generation. Batteries for storage of electricity is tiny compared with the enormity of the scale needed, and replenishment of the stored electricity is seldom mentioned. Paul Homewood mentions a good critique by Art Berman “IEA Optimism vs. Reality: The Contradictions in the Energy Transition.” After presenting a number of factual issues and graphs Berman concludes: “The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 offers an optimistic view of a smooth transition to renewables. This is at odds, however, with the realities of energy consumption, economic growth, and the hard limits of ecosystem capacity. Despite decades of investment, fossil fuel consumption remains stubbornly high, and expectations for renewables to sustain comparable economic growth are idealistic. The IEA and many renewable energy advocates ignore the fundamental problem of ‘overshoot’—the reality that human consumption has already surpassed the planet’s ecological limits. The optimistic projection for a renewable energy future reflects an inadequate understanding of the past and present. The idea that renewables can sustain continued economic growth without addressing the underlying issue of excessive resource use is dangerously naive. Economic expansion requires more than just cleaner energy—it demands vast material inputs and energy yields that renewables, in their current form, struggle to provide. By focusing only on decarbonization, these projections overlook the deeper challenge: a growth-based system incompatible with planetary boundaries. Until the obsession with endless growth and consumption is confronted, energy forecasts, no matter how green they appear, will remain built on wishful thinking.” See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy *************** Number of the Week: 95% In “#CheerfulCharts #13: US sulfur dioxide trends” links to and EPA chart: US Sulfur Dioxide Trends: National Tends. All regions of the US are below the minimum National Standard. This actual pollutant used to be a big problem in urban air in North America and Europe, but improved technology scrubbed from smokestacks and automobile exhaust, getting it out of the exhaust before it even got into the air we breathe. This is a success story for the EPA. Unfortunately, the EPA has gone on to disgrace its reputation by embracing the linear no-threshold model by regulating most amounts of particles in the air that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter PM2.5. But more egregiously. EPA has declared carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis, the source of food for all complex life, a pollutant. All without physical evidence of harm to humans. Further, EPA has declared all greenhouse gases are pollutants, but largely ignores the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor. Regulating water vapor is as far beyond the control of the EPA as regulating carbon dioxide emissions from China. See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy. Science: Is the Sun Rising?

Social Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Oh nuts, more CO2 By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 CO2 Science archive Problems in the Orthodoxy This game is easy By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 But then you read a column by the New York Times’ marquee climate writer David Gelles that starts with a baffled “Cleaning up the technology industry was supposed to be easy” and you realize that the fate of humankind is, to a disquieting degree, in the hands of people who think practical difficulties are invented by the malicious to sabotage an outbreak of peace, plenty and harmony. How was cleaning up anything, let alone an industry that requires a lot of weird mineral inputs, going to be “easy”? And here you thought everyone was as absolutist as you are on the subject. But of course, a major part of the problem was the overall promise that getting to Net Zero wouldn’t just be easy, it would take less than no work because the greener we got the richer as well as cleaner we’d get. All because we trusted our future to people who had inexplicably reached adulthood without discovering the existence of practical difficulties.

Because my funding has been tied to his projects (including the Alabama Office of the State Climatologist, which he heads), there is a good chance I will also be retiring on or before that date.

Unwinding the damage politicians and their bureaucrats have imposed will be slow and painful all the more so because there are only a handful of politicians aware of it. $650m in renewable energy didn’t save Broken Hill from days of blackouts after a storm islanded it By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Oct 28, 2024 Mayor of Broken Hill: “(Wind and solar) are worse than useless (in a crisis like this), because it’s detrimental to having a consistent power supply,” he said. “I’d hate to see what happens in the capital cities in a similar crisis.” Energy Issues — US An electrifying discrepancy By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 30, 2024 Link to: Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Representative Average Unit Costs of Energy By Staff, Department of Energy, Federal Register, Oct 17, 2024 Click to access 2024-23893.pdf Robson: On a per-unit of heat basis the Department of Energy estimates that electricity is the most expensive way to stay warm, at $47.36 per Btu. That’s 3.5 times costlier than the cheapest option, natural gas, which comes in at $13.38 per Btu. Heating oil, propane and kerosene are in between. Bipartisan Confrontation of the Minerals Crisis By Rich Nolan, Real Clear Energy, Oct 30, 2024 Each time the U.S. confronts China over trade practices – such as the stealing of intellectual property – or puts in place tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing now retaliates with export quotas on minerals we don’t – but should – produce here.

The Generational Opportunity for U.S. LNG By Tristan Abbey, WUWT, Oct 29, 2024 Regulatory uncertainty means higher costs, longer and delayed timelines, and potentially disrupted supply chains. “Turning off” LNG exports would cause a cascading series of dislocations throughout the economy, not only in the export sector. It has taken the better part of a generation already to achieve the nation’s dominant position in natural gas. [SEPP Comment: In the 1970s Washington thought the US was running out of natural gas and the world out of oil, and President Carter thought coal was the fuel needed to avoid the oncoming crisis.] Return of King Coal? Standing Up to the Coal Killers By Duggan Flanakin, Real Clear Energy, Oct 29, 2024 Back in April the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) agreed on a time frame for phasing out coal-fired power plants in the first half of the 2030s. There was just one problem: Only the U.S. and Germany are among the world’s top ten coal consumers. The UN counts as members both China and India, which together consume nearly 70% of the world’s coal production. Neither is a member of the G7. Nor does the “bold” G7 commitment explain how their self-imposed coal ban – which they want to impose on poor African nations – even matters. Nuclear Energy and Fears Japan nuclear reactor near Fukushima to restart By AFP Staff Writers, Tokyo (AFP) Oct 29, 2024 Japan has been turning back to nuclear power in order to cut emissions, reduce expensive imports of fossil fuels and meet energy demand for data centres for artificial intelligence (AI). Safety and regulatory standards have been tightened since, and the Onagawa plant — cleared in 2020 to re-start — has increased the height of its anti-tsunami wall to 29 metres (95 feet) above sea level, one of the highest in Japan. Bill Gates’ Energy Group, Former Google CEO Investing in Pacific Fusion Startup By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, The Series A funding is a phased approach.

Unfortunately, while each had a section on grid battery fires there was significant confusion as each cited a regulation that as I read it does not apply to grid scale battery complexes. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Electric Vehicles: A Tale of Woe in the Absence of the Market Process By Timothy G. Nash & Jason Hayes, Tom Rastin, Real Clear Energy, Oct 31, 2024 Milton Friedman explained that “market processes” allow individuals to interact and exchange goods and services voluntarily. The prices they charge in these exchanges guide production and consumption decisions, ultimately leading to the most efficient resource allocations, maximized customer satisfaction, and increased purchasing power, and this all occurs with minimal need for government interference.

And how did it go? Oh. Awkward. The suppliers of 14 “emissions-free, 28-foot shuttle buses” to be delivered in 2022 instead went… bankrupt. So they leaped into committee, preparing to draft a scheme for a plan to devise a call for bids by year-end for a handful of buses to arrive in 2026, or on the 14th of never.

Which has a certain logic to it, although if he had any research staff, they might have warned him that “stand and deliver!” was “said in the past by highwaymen when they stopped a carriage… to demand objects of value from the travelers” until America’s colorful hillbilly culture gave us the phrase “Reach for the sky” instead.

(Compass Nova Scotia).” And while we hate to do math in the midst of a spending blitz, including on the size of our national debt and interest payments on same, if it really takes over $5 million in subsidies to procure 13 houses, we’re never going to get enough of them. ARTICLES 1. America Can’t Do Without Fracking Shale is crucial to the U.S. economy, and it allows Washington to buttress our allies across the globe. By Daniel Yergin, WSJ, Oct. 30, 2024 TWTW Summary: The Chairman of S&P Global and long-time writer on energy begins with: “This year’s presidential race features an oddity: a discussion about a ban on fracking. What’s striking is that such a conversation is happening at all. This talk takes participants through the Wayback Machine to the first two decades of this century, when hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling—together known as fracking—came to public attention. The U.S. was then the world’s largest importer of oil. Today it is energy-independent with, S&P Global estimates, more than 70% of its oil and more than 80% of its natural gas produced through fracking. The process has become essential to the nation’s energy supply and can’t be eliminated. Not long ago the prospect of U.S. energy independence seemed fanciful. For more than four decades every president aspired to it, but their goal seemed unattainable. Many observers considered the U.S. destined to grow more dependent on imports. In recent years, however, America has achieved energy independence on a net basis. U.S. output is closing in on 13.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, exceeding that of perennial big producers Saudi Arabia and Russia by several million barrels per day. Add what are called natural-gas liquids, and the U.S. produces around 20 million barrels per day. Textbooks used to hold that commercial production of shale was impossible. Innovation and investment over decades have proved otherwise. Yet despite this progress, many continue to underestimate how transformative shale oil has been for the U.S. economy and the American way of life. Consider a concrete example. My firm estimates that battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will account for about 2% of the U.S. on-road light-vehicle fleet in 2024. If fracking were banned, the U.S. would need to import extraordinary amounts of oil to fuel our gasoline- and diesel-powered cars. In 2008, before shale-oil production began in earnest, the net bill for importing petroleum was $388 billion—more than 40% of the total merchandise trade deficit. Today the same bill, by contrast, is virtually nothing. There would be other costs to a phase-out of fracking. If the U.S. were to start importing again, the price of oil would doubtless rise, as we would be forced to compete for supplies with countries such as China, which is estimated to import more than 70% of its petroleum. The U.S. also exports a large amount of liquefied natural gas, mostly produced from shale. Without it, LNG’s positive effect on the trade balance would disappear too.” The author points out how disastrous a ban of fracking would be for the US allies in Europe and concludes with: “The same dynamic applies for U.S. allies in the Pacific. Japan and South Korea have come to rely on U.S. energy exports, which have proved essential for diversifying their supply and strengthening their security. Losing that contribution would make them more vulnerable, reduce their confidence in the reliability of the U.S., and likely push them toward importing from Russia. A ban on fracking would be both misguided and destructive for the U.S. and its allies. Recurrent out-of-touch debates on the topic need to be tabled in light of a central fact: Shale has become crucial to the U.S. economy and global energy security. It’s here to stay.” ************** 2. Climate Change Can Take Big Toll on Asian Economies, Inaction Could Cost More, ADB Report Says It could reduce Asia-Pacific’s gross domestic product by 17% in 2070, ADB says. By Fabiana Negrin Ochoa and Amanda Lee, WSJ, Oct 31, 2024 Link to: Asia-Pacific Climate Report 2024: Catalyzing Finance and Policy Solutions By Staff, Asian Development Bank, October 2024 TWTW Summary: The article and report are largely trivial. The estimated GDP of China was $114 billion in 1972 (50 years ago); it was $17,889 billion in 2023. About 157 times that of 1972. Doubt a calculated reduction of future growth of 17% 50 years from now is very meaningful to the leaders of Asian countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China What are subsidies? This is where the woke far left excel. Confusion will be their epitaph (h/t King Crimson). To get their way on anything they invoke confusion: What is a woman? What is a working person etc. In the UK Labour party some revel in it. Take the very black Dawn Butler MP. When Badenoch was announced the winner of the Tory leadership contest…. “Butler declared, “A victory for Badenoch is an obvious, unprecedented and once inconceivable victory for racism,” adding that ‘Badenochism’ should be viewed as “white supremacy in Blackface”. Butler is also an expert of biology…. “””Babies are born without sex””” – [D Butler] S***, she really does say babies are born without a sex https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/womens_rights/3825633-Dawn-Butler-and-biology Starmer refuses to act, I suppose Dawn would call him a racist xenophobe etc if he did. The Bertrand Russell quote reminds me of this: “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” – H.L. Mencken I am in my seventies, and it’s been hobgoblins all my life … the Cold War, Communists under our beds, the missile crisis, Palestinians, Jonestown, other Arabs, North Korea, school shootings, serial killers, and lately AIDS, Covid and Climate Change. Mencken says “most of them imaginary, I say all of them. Fear in the hands of government is the easiest way to control the masses. Bertrand Russell….[warning, full of expletives] (00:30) The Ostfront, sorry; Otto front. (Way more neck than a giraffe…) A special from the world’s leading man-made weather attributionist. “”Why did so many die in Spain? Because Europe still hasn’t accepted the realities of extreme weather – Friederike Otto … Scientists have long known that heating the climate with fossil fuel emissions will result in the intensification of floods, storms, heatwaves, drought and wildfires. However, it was not until 2004 that the first attribution study formally linked a weather event … I founded World Weather Attribution in 2014 to shift the conversation. Our attribution studies are carried out quickly, over days or weeks, in the immediate aftermath of weather disasters to inform people in real time about the role of the climate crisis. A quick analysis following the floods in Spain found that the climate emergency made the extreme rainfall about 12% more intense and twice as likely. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/04/spain-deaths-europe-realities-extreme-weather-flooding You have to laugh. Europe has seen it all over the last 1000 years. Hot and cold. The title of the article regarding the Northern Hemisphere 2024 Hurricane season outcome noted that this region is “clearly below normal” which is absolutely true. Even if the the Northern Hemisphere rate of ACE growth remained at the highest value yet attained during the August to October peak levels during November (which is not happening) the Northern Hemisphere Season total through November would be about 20% below the long term average. It is clear the Northern Hemisphere 2024 season total is going to be well below normal, The only question is how far below normal will it end. Considering how the alarmist media exaggerates every hurricane that occurs in the North Atlantic as being the worse ever it seems appropriate that the reality of the actual situation globally needs to be addressed in a context that shows how ridiculous absurd such claims really are.

Title: Intel reportedly scaling back R&D teams in Israel — several hundred talented staff will go

But already this year dozens have left for Nvidia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel plans to reduce its workforce by several hundred employees at its Israeli research and development centers, following similar job cuts at its facilities elsewhere, reports DigiTimes. This move is part of the company's general cost-cutting measures amid financial challenges, and it opens opportunities for competitors to attract Intel's talent. There is a catch, though, as dozens of Intel employees already left the company for Nvidia earlier this year, according to Globes. Intel's Israeli operations employ around 11,700 people, including 7,800 in R&D roles and 3,900 in manufacturing, with the latest layoffs expected to focus on R&D while leaving manufacturing staff largely intact as Intel readies for the completion of Fab 38 in Kiryat Gat, the report says. The exact number of people that will either be proposed to leave voluntarily, or retire, or just laid off is not known, but Globes reports that Intel is set to cut its Israeli workforce by several hundred positions. Intel has three R&D sites in Israel. Each of these Israeli centers has a specialized focus: Haifa works on CPUs, AI hardware, and software; Petah Tikva develops communications and AI solutions; and Jerusalem is involved in communications, software, and cybersecurity. The report does not specify which R&D sites will see more cuts, other than saying that layoffs are expected in these R&D centers. But let us try to detail at least one thing. Intel's Israeli R&D team is responsible for multiple breakthrough microarchitectures, such as Banias, Yonah/Merom, and Nehalem, just to name a few. Each of these was strategically important for Intel at some point. In fact, the Banias processor was the heart of Intel's Centrino platform, the company's first platform developed specifically for laptops, which pretty much revolutionized the market. Yonah/Merom put Intel back on the map of high-performance PCs and replaced the power-hungry Netburst microarchitecture that powered Pentium 4 processors. But while Intel itself is slashing its R&D talent in Israel, it should be noted that people are leaving the company, too. Nvidia has been hiring former Intel employees: in 2024 alone, at least 30 Intel employees moved to Nvidia's offices in Yokneam and Tel Aviv, with total hires from Intel estimated to range from 60 to 90, according to the Globes report which analyzed LinkedIn profiles. Nvidia is expected to hire more Intel employees as the layoffs continue, possibly bringing the number to about 100. As of June 30, Nvidia reported a workforce of 4,000 employees in Israel, reflecting the company’s growing presence in the region. Many Intel employees who moved to Nvidia are benefiting from more attractive compensation packages. For instance, a junior hardware engineer at Nvidia can expect a starting annual salary of NIS 566,000 (around $151,500), about 33% higher than the equivalent role at Intel. Nvidia also offers significantly more valuable share options compared to Intel, with packages starting at NIS 56,200 annually ($15,045). In addition to Nvidia, other major tech companies are also drawing former Intel employees. Apple, Amazon, and Intel's subsidiary Mobileye have recently hired from Intel's workforce in Israel. Some groups have joined Microsoft, Google, and Huawei, which operates a development center in Haifa. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: DAILY BEAST Tries to Claw Way Back to Relevance...
URL: https://dnyuz.com/2024/11/03/the-daily-beast-tries-to-claw-its-way-back-to-relevance/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:31:37Z
Full Content:
On a sunny morning in early October, Joanna Coles, clad in a stylish tomato-red coat, and Ben Sherwood, dressed more demurely in a corduroy jacket, convened at their regular breakfast spot, the no-frills Star on 18 diner on Manhattan’s Far West Side. The two veteran media executives were talking about their ambitious plans for The Daily Beast, the 16-year-old money-losing news website, in which they jointly acquired a minority stake in April. But along with the predictable optimism about the mission they are taking on and enthusiasm about early signs of audience uptick and subscriber growth, Ms. Coles, a former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and Mr. Sherwood, a onetime president of ABC News and Disney TV chief, also conveyed a sense of frustration. Frustration that they weren’t greeted by the staff they inherited as warmly as they expected. Frustration that the site’s tech problems meant they’ve had to buy multiple subscriptions just to log in. Frustration that convincing the newsroom of their editorial vision has been an uphill climb. Less than three weeks after the pair’s takeover, New York magazine published a detailed report on the friction between reporters and Ms. Coles over story suggestions that they deemed ridiculous, including an investigation into whether former President Donald J. Trump was having stress-induced flatulence during his criminal trial and a list of the most obese members of Congress. (Neither article ran.) It was clear that many of the sources for the report were inside the organization, with one unnamed staff member bluntly criticizing the new owners’ “warped vision” of the news site. “This thing came within a day of being sold to the private equity knacker’s yard, where it would have been stripped,” Ms. Coles said later in an interview at The Beast’s offices in Chelsea, using a British term for a junkyard. “In what way is it helpful to tape our conversations and to proudly boast that you are not going to even attempt to look at the stories that your new bosses are asking you to look at?” “To me, that’s just, like, ‘No wonder the place is going out of business,’” she added. For his part, Mr. Sherwood was aghast that Beast journalists had anonymously complained about a Daily Beast article on plans by Barron Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest son, to attend New York University. The article relied on a source of Ms. Coles and was published without a byline. “That happens to be something that she knew stone cold — her source was solid,” Mr. Sherwood said. “The organization went into a convulsion over this because Joanna did not reveal her source and no one could stand this up with any of their sources.” But, he asked, “where is Barron Trump at school now?” Indeed, the 18-year-old was spotted on the New York University campus for the start of the school year in September. Mr. Sherwood wrote a Beast article confirming the April scoop. The Daily Beast, launched in 2008 by the longtime magazine editor Tina Brown and backed by Barry Diller’s IAC, became known over the years as a cheeky and aggressive tabloid with reporting on politics and national security that often had an impact belying the relatively small size of its newsroom. In recent years, it published a series of damaging scoops on the Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker and broke the news of the arrest of the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Named for the fictional newspaper in Evelyn Waugh’s “Scoop,” The Daily Beast gave a platform to a new generation of writers, like Taylor Lorenz, Jamelle Bouie and Molly Jong-Fast. When Ms. Brown started the site — after stints editing Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and, less successfully, Talk magazine — she preached a mix of “high-low” stories. “The Daily Beast at its best was mischievous, subversive and absolutely 100 percent dedicated, often to the point of sociopathy, to breaking big news,” said Noah Shachtman, its editor in chief from 2018 to 2021. “If you look back at this moment in previous election cycles, The Beast played an incredible role.” But the outlet continuously lost money, and audience traffic has declined over the last two years. Fed up with the losses, Mr. Diller tried to offload The Daily Beast, at one point considering a deal with the Hollywood publication The Ankler and then looking to sell to a private-equity-backed publisher before landing on the partnership with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles. “It was imminent: We were selling The Beast,” Mr. Diller said in an interview. But after meeting with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, he felt their plan made sense. “I want to give it a last chance,” Mr. Diller said. “It’s very early in the process, but I am more than pleased that we made that decision.” Mr. Sherwood, 60, and Ms. Coles, 62, were jointly granted a 49 percent equity stake in the business, returning them to the day-to-day scrum of a media company. (None of the parties would disclose the financial details of the deal; IAC still retains majority control.) The two seem, on the face of it, an odd pairing. She’s a glamorous Briton who conquered the world of glossy magazines and is best known for her star turn as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan from 2012 to 2016. He’s a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar who made “Good Morning America” the top morning news show while president of ABC News from 2010 to 2014, before being promoted to oversee Disney’s TV group. They struck up a friendship in 2013 after Mr. Sherwood was impressed by a speech Ms. Coles gave at a New York awards event. By his telling, he went back to his office and immediately wrote her a letter saying he was inspired by her story of coming from Yorkshire, England, to “the pinnacle of publishing in America.” The pair met for lunch and discovered a mutually voracious love for the news. “We would try to text each other stories that we thought the other wouldn’t have come across,” Ms. Coles said. “And he really doesn’t miss anything. His breadth of reading is astonishing to me.” He has “a sense of the absurd and the funny, which a lot of people don’t,” she added. The two talked about doing a journalism project together when Ms. Coles left Hearst in 2018, after she was passed over for the presidency of the magazine division, and Mr. Sherwood left Disney in 2019. But nothing quite came together. In the years that followed, Mr. Sherwood founded and sold Mojo, a youth sports start-up, and Ms. Coles executive-produced the Freeform show “The Bold Type” while heading up a so-called blank-check company and sitting on the boards of Snap and Sonos. The thought of returning to a newsroom thrilled both Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, especially one that had the benefit of years of brand building under editors like Ms. Brown, John Avlon (now running for Congress), Mr. Shachtman (who went on to lead Rolling Stone) and Tracy Connor, who had come to The Daily Beast from the NBC News investigative unit. But Ms. Coles and Mr. Sherwood had to immediately confront the fact that the media landscape had changed significantly in their time away from it. In the past few years, BuzzFeed News has shut down, Vice Media filed for bankruptcy and other publishers did mass layoffs. And new competitors kept coming: Puck, Punchbowl, The Free Press, Semafor, the various writers building their singular empires on Substack (including, just recently, Ms. Brown herself). The Beast was on track to lose $10 million this year, Mr. Sherwood said, and had been losing money and audience for five consecutive quarters before the deal in April. “The plans that had been set in place were on a path to lose tens and tens of millions of dollars, and that path was no longer viable and IAC was no longer going to do that,” Mr. Sherwood said. That was the message he and Ms. Coles delivered when they met with the staff of The Daily Beast for the first time on April 15. They thought the newsroom would be relieved that it was now in the hands of experienced media executives with serious bona fides who were committed to revitalizing it. The Beast staff saw it differently. According to interviews with nearly a dozen former and current members, some of whom shared notes taken at the first meetings with their new bosses, and all of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardizing their career prospects, Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles came across as aggressive and relentlessly negative about the state of The Beast and the work that its staff was doing. Ms. Coles, who serves as the chief creative and content officer and runs the editorial side of the operation, told the staff that she and Mr. Sherwood wanted more “funny” and would “flood the zone” with content, the staff members said. Mr. Sherwood, who is the publisher and chief executive, became visibly angry when discussing his personal grievance: the technology issues that bedeviled the site’s paywall and payment system. In the weeks that followed, Ms. Coles began issuing story ideas that many in the newsroom chafed at and suggested hiring a “Lauren Sánchez correspondent” to report on the fiancée of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Reporters started leaving, including the Washington bureau chief, Matt Fuller, and some of his political reporters. (Mr. Fuller’s replacement, Martin Pengelly, a journalist from The Guardian, lasted five weeks in the job.) In early June, The Beast’s editor in chief since 2021, Ms. Connor, was replaced with Hugh Dougherty, an editor from The New York Post and, like Ms. Coles, a veteran of the British press. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles announced a voluntary buyout program with an aim of cutting costs by $1.5 million. By the beginning of July, The Beast’s head count was down about 35 percent through the buyouts and a handful of layoffs. Ms. Coles has a specific vision for what The Beast can do: shorter and sharper articles that focus on people, power, politics and pop culture, with a dose of satire to lighten the mood during a perilous time. She says she is fascinated by the extremes of wealth and power and behavior, and pointed to articles about A-list celebrities who gave Sean Combs cover and the troubles of Will Lewis, the chief executive of The Washington Post, as recent highlights. “I wanted something that curated a lot of news out there that wasn’t about the end of democracy all the time,” she said. Ms. Coles said she felt that The Beast had “some very good editors” over the years, but that its place in the media landscape had been diminished. “I certainly wasn’t reading it on a regular basis,” she said. “Another editor said to me when we came here, he said: ‘It’s the boring avatar of the resistance.’ I thought he summed it up in one.” She is trying to spark ideas and reinvigorate the newsroom’s culture, which she said had been affected when the pandemic caused more people to work remotely. Beast employees are now required to work in the office four days a week. “We have some really good people here who were here all along who are excited by the mission and re-energized,” Ms. Coles said. There are others she was not as fond of. Ms. Coles recounted that a political reporter did not call in to the newsroom on the Sunday that President Biden announced he would drop out of the presidential race. Ms. Coles was at her house in the Hamptons that day, hosting her friend Emma Tucker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal and a fellow Briton, and the pair “turned my dining room table into an ad hoc newsroom.” “I was incredulous that a political reporter would not call in because it was the weekend,” she said. “To me it was madness that we would have political correspondents who didn’t want to cover that story immediately.” That political reporter, Jake Lahut, who has since left, referred The New York Times to the three articles he filed the day that Mr. Biden dropped out. “The most important lesson I’ve learned from this is how not to run a newsroom,” Mr. Lahut said. There has been “a Niagara of news,” as Ms. Coles described it, in the lead-up to November’s election, but The Beast’s newsroom is now less than half the size it was six months ago. And days away from the presidential election, the Washington bureau is staffed with just two people. “They saved us, to what end?” one reporter who has left The Beast asked. “What is The Daily Beast now, and is it better?” The lack of staffing during an intense news period has turned the newsroom into a churn factory, according to people with knowledge of the work environment, with pressure on employees to pump out articles to generate as much reader traffic as possible. The newsroom has been asked to publish at least 40 posts a day, which is what it was producing before the staffing cuts. According to a presentation given to the newsroom in September, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, The Daily Beast published more than 210 articles in three days around the presidential debate in September. Many of the articles on the website are now aggregated from content published elsewhere or written by freelance contributors, though there is still some original reporting. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles have also contributed to the site, with Mr. Sherwood appearing to relish a return to his reporting days of decades ago: He has already written more than 50 articles, including updates on the Menendez brothers’ case (which Mr. Sherwood notes he has followed since 1989) and a post on the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad. The Coles-and-Sherwood Daily Beast has had its outside detractors. Ms. Jong-Fast, the MSNBC pundit and former Beast editor-at-large, said in an interview: “At a time when we need brave voices and serious journalism more than ever, it’s devastating to watch it devolve into tacky clickbait.” The NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny, another former Beast writer, posted a similar view on Instagram Threads in September: “It’s weird watching someone buy something you love, take that thing that was once good, and just slowly murder it in public. Anyway RIP The Daily Beast.” Despite criticism of The Beast’s editorial approach, Mr. Sherwood credited the heightened news cycle over the last few months with helping the site record four months of subscriber growth. Data from the measurement firm Comscore showed a recent bump in visitors to The Beast’s site, with 21.3 million in September, up from a monthly average of 13.8 million in 2023. “They have had a profitable month or two, which historically has not happened at The Beast,” Mr. Diller said. “That is quite significant.” Mr. Sherwood said they were stabilizing the business by getting the staff to the right size, fixing the technology powering the website and migrating to a new content management system. (The company recently added a president and chief operating officer, the tech entrepreneur Keith Bonnici.) Mr. Sherwood said they would focus on growth in their second year, such as exploring new revenue streams. “We are totally aware of how hard and adverse the conditions are,” Mr. Sherwood said, but “we’re more optimistic in the path than ever with independent, feisty, intelligent tabloid journalism.” Ms. Coles has focused on building buzz for the new Daily Beast. She regularly appears on cable television shows, and recently suggested without evidence on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Mr. Trump was “microdosing drugs,” a claim the host Jonathan Lemire had to quickly clear up. She has tapped her extensive Rolodex to sign up Samantha Bee, the television host and comedian, to co-host a podcast with her. Guests so far have included the “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver and the Democratic strategist James Carville. The Beast also was quick to jump on the non-endorsement scandals engulfing The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, posting a link to subscribe on X with the message: “The Daily Beast reports without fear or favor. Apparently, that’s something not all newsrooms can do.” Ms. Brown, the founder, said she had advised Ms. Coles on “reviving the talent” and getting a mix of seasoned reporters and young writers. “The Daily Beast is really an upscale tabloid with attitude,” Ms. Brown said. “I think it definitely needed a face-lift.” The post The Daily Beast Tries to Claw Its Way Back to Relevance appeared first on New York Times.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. We're into the final hours before election day. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted. Business Insider will be covering this final stretch and the days that follow with a sharp focus on what the next president will mean for you. From the prices you pay to how to invest, we'll have you covered. And if you're looking for a break from politics, we'll also continue to bring you all of the most important stories in business. You can find it all on our homepage or on our app. On the agenda today: But first: Takeaways from a big week in Big Tech. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The trillion-dollar giants of Big Tech reported earnings this week, beating estimates and committing billions to AI. The big winners: Those able to signal a strong return on that investment. Alphabet Google's cloud business benefited from AI adoption, posting a 35% year-over-year increase in revenues, while CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of the company's new code is now created by AI. The core advertising business held strong despite growing competition from the likes of OpenAI, Reddit, and more. Amazon The retail and cloud giant smashed expectations, sending the stock soaring on Friday. It also benefited from AI adoption, as cloud unit AWS posted a 19% increase in revenues. A strong performance in retail, where execs said shoppers were buying cheaper items at higher volumes, and a sharp focus on cost control had investors cheering. Apple Apple beat revenue and profit estimates overall, but a year-over-year decline in revenue in China left investors underwhelmed. All eyes are now on demand for the iPhone 16 and whether new Apple Intelligence features help juice sales. Meta Meta beat estimates, though user growth came in below expectations. Mark Zuckerberg promised to keep spending on AI and flexed Meta's huge cluster of Nvidia H100 chips. Microsoft Microsoft also beat estimates, but concerns around capacity constraints in AI and the return on its investments in the space led the tech giant's stock lower across the week. In preparation for its future of autonomous vehicles, Tesla has been leaning on a specialized group of test drivers, part of what's known internally as "Project Rodeo." BI spoke with nine test drivers, who described sometimes perilous scenarios and near-crashes while testing unreleased software. Here's what they said. Scaling the corporate ladder was once a cornerstone of the American dream. Now, 42% of Americans say they don't even want a promotion, according to a survey by global HR consultancy Randstad. That's higher than the countries known for being more chill about work, like Italy, Spain, and New Zealand. The anti-advancement shift has left bosses scratching their heads. If promotions won't motivate workers, what will? Packing up the corporate ladder. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on freebies. It's part of a wider push to cut costs across the industry. The lavish perks culture, once aimed at subsidizing nearly everything, led to entitlement and rule-bending among some employees. In a new era of efficiency and layoffs, tech workers need to get used to a new, non-extravagant normal. Use it, don't abuse it. As tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army is training warfighters for combat if a conflict with China breaks out. BI's Graham Flanagan spent two weeks in Hawaii to document the Army's sprawling, $16 million war-games exercise across the island chain. Watch the documentary here. This week's quote: "We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate." — Amazon employees in a signed letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman, protesting his return-to-office comments. More of this week's top reads: LinkedIn thinks using AI could fix our hiring crisis — and help your career. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 3, 2024 Lionsgate Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina and Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 “Beware of the cliché, the predictable”: that’s one of the notes about storytelling that Francis Ford Coppola keeps posted where he works, as he reports in his book Live Cinema and Its Techniques.1 Watching Megalopolis—Coppola’s first film in thirteen years, funded with over $100 million of his own money—I realized that it should be two rules, not one. Cliché and predictable are not, in fact, synonyms. Megalopolis is one of the least predictable films ever made, a disorienting jumble of sci-fi, romance, political drama, historical epic, body horror, musical, satire, surrealism, magical realism, filmed theater, illustrated lecture, and inspirational after-school special. Scenes veer from stagy speeches to slapstick violence, hallucinatory dance numbers to raunchy sex to flashy special effects. Baffling details flicker by—a tree stump in the shape of a swastika, a sudden murder with a tiny bow and arrow, repeated incest jokes—not only without explanation but often without acknowledgment. A character might set off on a crucial mission only to disappear, and then be summarily killed in a flashback. A ludicrous plot twist might be interrupted by a moment of startling beauty. The protagonist, Cesar, played by Adam Driver, can stop time—an ability given increasing symbolic weight but no elaboration, and which he never puts to any use at all. And yet, somehow, amid or perhaps beneath the chaos, the film is constructed almost entirely from clichés. Its hero is a wild playboy who is also a moody genius with a tragic, secret past; he has fabulous wealth, a loyal majordomo/father figure, a confusing amount of political power (it makes more sense if you have read the back of The Power Broker, less if you have read the book), a mother who is never satisfied, and a Nobel Prize. He wants to remake his city—how is never exactly clear, though it involves more parks, and perhaps a new form of moving sidewalk—but is resisted by the elite, who are corrupt or depraved or both: the depraved ones do cocaine in spacious, well-lit nightclubs, and the corrupt skulk around in dark fedoras. The mayor, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), is corrupt not in any particular actions but as a basic feature, the way some people are tall or left-handed. He has a pragmatic fixer named, the credits tell us, “Nush ‘the Fixer’ Berman,” as well as a beautiful, pure-hearted daughter, who falls in love with the hero and, slowly but surely, wins her father over to the hero’s cause. America is a decadent empire—like Rome, which is why the film’s version of New York is renamed New Rome, and why some (but not all) of the characters have Roman names and occasionally take part in Roman-ish activities. Here we encounter a strange phenomenon: a set of symbols so obvious they obscure the things they symbolize. The high and the low of New Rome gather in a coliseum to watch gladiators wrestle: What does this tell us about life in the nonfictional America, where actors, pop stars, and Donald Trump can be found cageside at UFC fights, while millions watch from home? (In case we’d forgotten the phrase “bread and circuses,” New Rome’s fights and chariot races are followed by a literal circus.) The festivities also include a set of “Vestal Virgins,” led by a singer named Vesta who is celebrated simultaneously for her sex appeal and her ostentatious chastity, and who later pivots to a bad-girl image after a scandal—which would all be quite illuminating, perhaps, if Britney Spears or Miley Cyrus had never existed. The film’s setting, too, is a chaotic rearrangement of the deeply familiar: not just ancient Rome added onto New York, but a version of New York that seems to exist simultaneously in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2020s. It’s a city of overcoats and flash drives, deep fakes and dusty municipal archives—all, one assumes, to indicate the timelessness of this “fable,” as the opening credits declare it. It is a confounding thing to watch. * In his notes about Fountain City—the 1,500-page novel, also about a visionary attempting to create a new urban utopia, that he worked on for years before finally abandoning—Michael Chabon uses the term draftitis to explain some of the book’s deficiencies. It “is a condition seen in manuscripts that have been rewritten several times,” he explains, especially “in passages where the writer has changed his or her mind,” a problem that “plagued me most often in my work as a screenwriter.” The problems might seem superficial, but they are “often a symptom of a more serious condition, namely authorial alienation.” That alienation seems to afflict much of Megalopolis. Coppola has, by his own account, been gathering material for the project for over forty years, and “must have rewritten it 300 times.” Much of the original research and conception was done in the 1980s, but Coppola’s first serious attempt to make it wasn’t until 2001; the film was well into preproduction when the September 11 attacks happened, putting it on hold again. (One plot point, strangely rushed past despite its importance, involves an old Soviet satellite plummeting from space and destroying a chunk of lower Manhattan.) It is hard not to think of this span of time while you watch, as characters, tones, and themes drift in and out erratically, like several different movies superimposed on one another. Even the grandest moments of spectacle and drama—a love scene on girders suspended above a glowing city, a political conspiracy breaking out into mob violence—come through as thin and muffled, as if we were watching them from far away. Advertisement Part of this is stylistic. In the decades since Coppola’s run of masterpieces in the 1970s—The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, Apocalypse Now—he has been looking for a way to make an entirely different sort of movie. “There are any number of styles one is able to choose in the movie business,” he complains in Live Cinema, “as long as it’s realism.” He means that word quite broadly, it seems, to include any film based around naturalistic lighting, lifelike sets, or location shooting. (There are plenty of definitions, after all, that would exclude all four of his most famous films: a pair of romanticized gangster epics, a paranoid thriller, and a surreal war movie.) Some of the work-for-hire he produced after he went bankrupt in the 1980s was necessarily in the traditional Hollywood mode, but the films on which he has had the most freedom have been marked by flamboyant artificiality: the glowing soundstage pseudo-Vegas of One from the Heart (1981), the anachronistic in-camera special effects of Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992), the fairytale dreamscapes of Twixt (2011). Lionsgate Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero and Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 In his recent book The Path to Paradise: A Francis Ford Coppola Story—a partial biography, mainly focused on the shooting of Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart, with the production of Megalopolis acting as a frame—Sam Wasson explains this shift as a reaction to the chaos of Apocalypse Now.2 In that film, Wasson writes, Coppola “had had a hard time getting real life to look the way he wanted it to look.” (A droll understatement, for a location shoot that went months over schedule and millions over budget, killed a crew member and hospitalized its lead actor, and drove Coppola into near-breakdown and marital estrangement.) “Shooting at a studio,” as he did for One from the Heart, “it was easier to control all the elements of moviemaking—color, light, scenery, actors—the way a painter has to control every brushstroke on his canvas.” Or, perhaps, the way Cesar yearns to control his city. Megalopolis, likewise, was shot primarily on soundstages, and makes extensive use of digital backdrops. Any hint of the real world is carefully excluded, in favor of a glowing, golden-hued artificiality, otherworldly and airless in equal measure. Its backgrounds are never more than that, flat and distant from the actors no matter how many inventive flourishes are packed into them. Among other things, Wasson’s book offers a reminder of how intertwined Coppola’s career has been with that of George Lucas. Lucas’s very first job in Hollywood was as an assistant on Coppola’s 1968 musical, Finian’s Rainbow, and Coppola produced Lucas’s first two feature films, THX 1138 (1971) and American Graffiti (1973). They shared collaborators, most notably the editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and scripts (Lucas was at one point meant to direct Apocalypse Now). And both, as they became successful, attempted to change how movies were made: not just “pursuing similar if not identical goals in the advancement of post-production technology”—Coppola was a pioneer of electronic editing and quadrophonic sound mixing, as Lucas was of special effects—but creating their own alternatives to the studio system. Lucasfilm was a more staid, less artistically radical (and less financially reckless) endeavor than Coppola’s American Zoetrope, yet “we both have the same goals,” Lucas declared. “We both have the same ideas and we both have the same ambitions.” In fact, the closest thing there is to a precedent for Megalopolis is Lucas’s own high-budget passion project: the Star Wars prequels. They share with Coppola’s film a stultifying reliance on digital backgrounds. They share, too, a discordant mix of acting styles, as each performer struggles in their own way to deliver wooden, ridiculous dialogue—alongside Hayden Christensen’s “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere,” we now have Driver’s “Go back to the cluuub.” In both, the filmmaker was insulated, through sheer monetary abundance, from any and all interference, untethered from corporate dictates and collaborative compromise. But the Star Wars prequels are still grounded in a familiar fictional setting and guided by Lucas’s instincts as a showman—they are meant above all to entertain. Megalopolis is after something else, something more ambitious and inward. Advertisement * Wasson describes Coppola approaching filmmaking from the beginning of his career as a personal “rite of passage…each [project] lived by Coppola in tandem with his creation.” But most of his earlier works started with other people’s ideas: the Godfather films with Mario Puzo’s novel, Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart with preexisting scripts, not to mention the various hired-gun projects that followed. Someone else’s vision was always there for Coppola to struggle with and build on, however much he eventually made it his own. Lionsgate Grace Vanderwaal, center, as Vesta Sweetwater in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 His films this century—three small-scale features, which he has said “were meant to teach me what making movies really was,” and now Megalopolis—are more directly personal. Each contains at least some aspect drawn straight from his own life. The very first line of 2007’s Youth Without Youth (based on a novel by Mircea Eliade, his only recent film not a wholly original script) speaks to its director’s fears: “Sometimes,” the elderly protagonist declares, “I admit to myself that it’s possible I will never be able to finish my life’s work.” Much of the dramatic situation of Tetro (2009)—a younger brother estranged, as Coppola was, from the older brother he reveres, both siblings oppressed by an arrogant composer father much like the Coppolas’—matches his biography, right down to the father’s declaration that the family has room for only one genius, him. The climax of Twixt comes with a flashback to the death of the protagonist’s child in a boating accident, which is how Coppola’s eldest son was killed. In Megalopolis, Cesar’s airy penthouse office, where he dreams up his vision for a new city, seems modeled after the one on top of the Sentinel Building in San Francisco that Coppola had renovated after the success of The Godfather—a room “so beautiful…Coppola would tell [the designer] he wouldn’t let anyone photograph it,” Wasson reports. And Cesar’s Renaissance man workshop full of excited young people expresses Coppola’s dreams for American Zoetrope, a place where “everybody—all the filmmakers—could do whatever they wanted,” and where schoolchildren were brought in to learn film production firsthand. Even minor details turn out to be plucked from autobiography, like a brief appearance by two young reporters from The Dingbat News—which is the name of the schoolgirl newsletter Sofia Coppola and her friends wrote on the Zoetrope lot in the early 1980s. And yet, perversely, as his work has become more personal, at times nakedly autobiographical, it has also become less affecting. These moments, which should be moving or even heartbreaking, are instead melodramatic, campy, or just confusing. It is as if the deeper he has gone into his own experiences and emotions, the further he has left the rest of us behind. He’s down there somewhere; we can hear his voice, drifting up in fragments. * One word that comes through quite clearly is “ideas.” That, we have repeatedly been told, is what Megalopolis is really about. Coppola has spoken about all the books he drew from while working on it—Herman Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game, Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, David Graeber’s Debt, Bullshit Jobs, and The Dawn of Everything, along with “everything I had ever read or learned about.” Mayor Cicero and Cesar are self-evidently meant to represent ideas of how to approach urban life, and life in general: the worldly and cynical (“People don’t need dreams, people need help now”) versus the idealistic (“Don’t let the now destroy the forever”), with the deck stacked heavily in favor of the latter. The ideas stop there. There is little discussion about how cities actually work, or could work; about how societies change, or might be changed; about history or government or anything else. Cesar’s utopian vision seems to consist of a few stray quotes from Shakespeare and Marcus Aurelius, a vague notion that rooms could change along with their inhabitants, and an affection for parks. His grand Megalopolis project, revealed at the end of the film, looks like a slightly vegetal remix of the Vessel, from New York’s Hudson Yards—a hideous tourist trap that has been repeatedly shut down after people killed themselves by jumping off it. Lionsgate Giancarlo Esposito as Mayor Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 If you stay for the credits, you might notice one for an “architectural and scientific advisor”: Neri Oxman, the designer and former MIT professor who, after Business Insider accused her of plagiarism this past January, was vigorously defended by her husband, the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Her “Man-Nahāta” project—a set of studies of the possible future of New York City, including a group of circular models exhibited at SFMOMA in 2022, commissioned by Coppola though essentially absent from the film—imagines the city overrun, in the coming centuries, not just by climate change but by great waves of jargon: “the city undergoes time-based decomposition, its organic substances breaking down into megalithic architectural elements.” Perusing the website of Oxman, the design firm she launched this fall, is almost as baffling as watching Megalopolis, as genuine environmental concerns disappear into the fog of sentences like “a generative design process that unites human-centric cultural typologies with Nature-centric needs to maximize ecological thriving.” One of the most discussed scenes in the film is a brief press conference Cesar holds, around the midpoint. At a few screenings, this moment involved a sudden outbreak of live performance: someone would emerge from the audience and ask a prewritten question into a microphone, to which Cesar would respond onscreen. Coppola’s original plan was to use a version of Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant to allow the actual audience to shout out questions, with the most relevant of several clips of Cesar answering then played in response—a plan that was abandoned after a wave of Amazon layoffs included the engineers who were working with Coppola. It’s an audacious idea, but the most shocking thing about this scene is how Cesar actually responds, no matter his questioner. “Is this society,” he asks, “is this way we’re living, the only one that’s available to us? And when we ask these questions, when there’s a dialogue about them, that basically is a utopia.” That, basically, is the level of thought this film provides. We get repeated gestures in the direction of ideas, or rather Ideas, restatements of the need for discussion, but no actual discussion—no details, no complications, no development. At some point over the years, Coppola seems to have lost touch not only with who these characters are and what kind of world they exist in, but with why any of this mattered in the first place. This is one of the most peculiar things about Megalopolis: it is so unusual, so packed with incident, and so clearly of such vast importance to its creator, yet it feels so empty. Sometime later, Cesar repeats himself: “We are in need of a great debate about the future!” he announces in the film’s finale, and it is never clearer that Coppola is speaking through him to us. But all he’s saying is that someone should say something. * Megalopolis might, in the end, be most intelligible not as an analysis but as a symptom. In the story of Cesar the misunderstood genius, the dictatorial apostle of dialogue, we can see glimpses of a very particular understanding of the world. This is what it looks like to a self-confident man of a certain sort: someone who has been rich and famous for over half his life, someone who is convinced of his own benevolence, who still sees himself as an outsider, who says things like “What I do is create chaos and then try to control it.” (It is true that Coppola went bankrupt in the middle of his career, but there are bankruptcies and there are bankruptcies, as Trump has taught us. Coppola’s was not the kind where you lose your health care or end up homeless, but the kind where you have to direct The Rainmaker.) This is evidently what he worries about and how he thinks things work. This is the world—this is us—seen from the top of the tower. It is a world, for instance, in which a few chosen people—artists, who are the same as scientists—can achieve almost anything, as long as they have a beautiful woman by their side to inspire them, and to run home and make dinner. (She may still be a professional subordinate, if it’s early in the relationship.) It’s a world in which true change is decided by a couple of men—rich, powerful, and probably related to each other—arguing across a very expensive table. A world in which democracy is, on those rare occasions when one is forced to acknowledge it, never anything more than a mob of idiots, manipulated by a few degenerates. A world in which powerful oratory—powerful enough, on one occasion, to completely subdue that mob—involves reciting Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy in its entirety, and asking questions like “What is time?” There are times when Megalopolis feels like it should be set not in New York, or New Rome, but in Silicon Valley. Cesar’s gleaming vision of the future has a distinct air of the tech campus. His vague, unbounded genius seems an emanation from the ego of a very well-funded founder, the kind of man who employs so many scientists and engineers he starts to think he is both. At other times, the movie feels set in a hazy memory of New York, a storybook city of animate statues and sneering villains, waiting for a caring father to set things right. Lionsgate Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 It is also a world in which there is nothing more dangerous than a sexy second wife. This is a subject on which the film becomes unusually coherent: the subplot in which the financial reporter Wow Platinum seduces and manipulates the rich, elderly banker Crassus and uses his wealth for her own spiteful ends is the most forceful and sustained section of the story. That Aubrey Plaza’s writhing, maniacal performance as Wow is delightful does not change what a tired, misogynistic caricature she is, a barely human creature of lust and viciousness. She is also the only major character who is killed, and quite brutally. One might notice, as well, that this is a world in which sex scandals turn out to be bullshit—just another speed bump thrown up by the haters. When Cesar’s enemies accuse him of statutory rape, the charges are doubly dismissed: not only was the sex tape a deep fake, but the girl was lying about her age and was actually in her twenties all along. Here we might remember a few things: that the index to Wasson’s book has entries under “Coppola, Francis Ford, infidelity of,” including an account of a long-term relationship in the 1970s with an assistant; that he has declared that he intentionally cast “canceled” actors in Megalopolis, such as Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf, to avoid it being “deemed some woke Hollywood production”; and that he has been accused by an extra of sexual harassment on the set of the film—which he has vigorously denied, and over which he has since sued Variety, which reported the allegations, for $15 million. Or perhaps a few of us might remember something he said back in 2006, when asked about Victor Salva, a filmmaker he supported professionally both before and after Salva was convicted of molesting a child actor while filming his first feature, Clownhouse (1989). “You have to remember,” Coppola told a reporter, “while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small—Victor was practically a child himself.” Salva was twenty-nine years old at the time of the crime, his victim twelve. There may, in the end, be a benefit to Megalopolis’s chronic draftitis. With its long and messy gestation, it unintentionally tracks some of the most destructive changes of the past half-century: the smooth slide of countercultural idealism into technocratic arrogance, the ascent of the very rich into a cuckooland of mushy pseudo-thought and thin-skinned vindictiveness, the decay of Great Man hero worship into misogynistic backlash. Watching this film is a very effective—and very useful—reminder of how inimical extreme wealth is to democratic thinking, to clear thinking in general, and to basic human sympathy. “If I could leave you with one thought after you see my new film,” Coppola wrote in a statement that accompanied early screenings of Megalopolis, “it would be this: Our founders borrowed a Constitution, Roman Law, and Senate for their revolutionary government without a king, so American History could neither have taken place nor succeed as it did without classical learning to guide it.” For better or for worse, I doubt a single member of its audience has left the theater with that in mind. The more sympathetic might be thinking of the pathos of an octogenarian director devoting his millions to a story about a man who can stop time. Others might be laughing at the headline, briefly glimpsed in a montage, declaring “TEEN PREGNANCY SKYROCKETS!” or wondering at the genuinely astonishing shot, late in the film, of a pregnant woman underwater who turns out to be an image painted onto human bodies, and changes when they move. Or they might be thinking of Wow, and wondering who the real Cesars will vote for on Tuesday.

Nvidia's AI leadership and Intel's bungling of its finances leads to this shakeup in the financial world. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia will replace Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicating the massive impact of the AI boom on the semiconductor and tech industries and the entire market. According to CNBC, this change will happen on November 8, about three months after news of Intel's financial woes broke out. The move was sparked by Intel's massive stock price drop—over 30% overnight—following the disastrous financial results released last August. The company has been bleeding cash through its data center and foundry divisions, resulting in a $1.6 billion loss for the second quarter of 2024. This was soon followed by news of massive layoffs, with over 15,000 employees affected. On the other hand, Nvidia’s stock price has been growing by leaps and bounds owing to the AI boom. For a short time, it has become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. Even though the company has dropped down to second place next to Apple, it’s still a remarkable rise in such a short amount of time. Nvidia's share price was $14.16 in November 2022, rising by 218% to $45.01 a year later. Today, the company’s stock price is $135.37, another 201% jump over the past 12 months. This means that the company’s value jumped by over 850% in just two years. Intel entered the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1999, but its 25-year run was cut short by its failure to take the lead in artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Nvidia's replacement would be the fourth tech company worth over a trillion dollars to make it into the Dow, after Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Interestingly, Amazon entered the list just this year after replacing the retail company Walgreens in February. A five-person committee, including editors from the Wall Street Journal, selects the companies to be included in the list. Although there are no specific rules for a company to be considered for the Dow, the committee members consider the following factors when determining which organizations will be added: large market capitalization, industry leadership, sustained financial growth, and investor interest. Nvidia’s entry into the list ticks all these boxes, showing the financial market’s positive outlook on the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: Many proclaimed remote work is here to stay. They couldn't be more wrong as big firms increasingly take a hardline stance

Big Read The timing of recent announcements by companies saying employees must return to the office reflects one possible factor for the trend: When one high-profile business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit, experts say. (Illustration: CNA/ Nurjannah Suhaimi) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Grab’s sudden announcement on Oct 24 that it will be reversing its three-year hybrid work policy and requiring employees to return to office full-time may have caught some people off-guard. But for at least one employee, the writing had been on the wall for some time. The 30-something employee, who wanted to be known only as Ms Sam, said that since the middle of last year, the tech company started asking staff to return to the office more frequently – thrice a week instead of twice. Then, at the start of this year, Grab declared it would take “disciplinary action” against those who were non-compliant, she said. “I had a feeling (full return-to-office) would happen, especially with how Amazon and other tech companies are moving,” Ms Sam told CNA TODAY, referring to the American tech giant's announcement in September mandating working in the office five days a week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September that by being in office it was "easier to strengthen our culture" and collaboration is made "simpler and more effective". Mr Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, later said that the new policy had received broad support from workers. Amazon’s U-turn on remote and hybrid work – as well as its comply-or-leave ultimatum – was met with strong resistance: This week more than 500 of its employees wrote to Mr Garman urging a reversal of the decision. The letter described the management's explanation for the return-to-office mandate as “non-data-driven” and referred to Mr Garman’s own past comments, when he said the company was running effectively while fully remote. Other big-name employers globally have also taken a strong public stance on employees' physical attendance at the workplace, reversing the remote work trend that many had lauded as the new norm after the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney at the begining of 2023 mandated a return to office for four days a week. In April the same year, JP Morgan asked all its managing directors to return to office every weekday, and other employees thrice a week. In justifying the move, Disney CEO Bob Iger said nothing could replace the ability to connect and co-create when the team is physically together, while JP Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said remote work hinders "spontaneous idea generation". And before them, Elon Musk back in 2022 ordered Tesla and X (at the time still called Twitter) employees to clock in 40 hours in office a week or leave, saying that the creation of great products cannot happen with workers "phoning in". Most recently, it was reported this week that Starbucks recently announced a stricter enforcement of its three-days-in-office policy. From January, employees who do not comply risk losing their jobs. This slew of “back-to-office” mandates comes as a CEO Outlook 2024 Report by professional services firm KPMG published in September found that CEOs are hardening their stance on returning to pre-pandemic ways of working, with 83 per cent of business leaders globally expecting a full return to the office within the next three years. Ms Nicki Doble, principal adviser for corporate transformation, advisory, from professional KPMG in Singapore, said: “We have also seen many employers setting specific benchmarks for the number of days that employees are required to be in office.” This back-to-office fever seems to have reached Singapore’s shores, too, with companies recently asking their employees to work in the office more frequently, if not every day. Data from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) also shows a steady decline in the proportion of companies here offering a scheduled teleworking arrangement – from 56.5 per cent in 2021 to 31.9 per cent last year. Scheduled teleworking refers to an arrangement where employees are allowed to work remotely for an agreed period of time. Companies that do not offer scheduled teleworking arrangements could offer it on an ad-hoc basis or not at all, but no breakdown of such data is available. The number of job vacancies that offer remote work here has also declined, from 35 per cent in 2020 to 21 per cent in 2022, according to MOM's latest figures. All these developments come as recent research offers a mixed picture of how relatively productive work-from-home is compared with traditional working on-site, with some studies noting a tangible drop in productivity when employees work remotely full-time. And while many companies alluded to productivity as a factor when bringing their workers back to the office, human resource and labour experts told CNA TODAY that there may be other explanations for the trend. The timing of the recent spate of announcements points to one factor: When one high-profile company or business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit. Labour economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Walter Theseira said: “Nobody wants to be the first but when there is a wave of companies doing this actually, then that's when you see employers put into place what they wanted to do all along.” It seems contradictory when Singapore has been taking steps to encourage greater acceptance of flexible work arrangements, with the MOM introducing mandatory guidelines that will take effect in December. With work-from-home increasingly viewed by employers as an arrangement that has outlived its purpose, what will these recent developments mean for the future of other flexible work arrangements in Singapore? While a growing number of bosses are taking a tougher stance on employees being physically present in the office, many workers are still unconvinced about the need to do so. Multiple surveys indicate that the majority of workers around the world still prefer to work some days at home. For example, a poll by a US human resource solutions firm Bamboo HR, published in June, found that 42 per cent of American employees who returned to the office say they feel like they are showing up just for visibility. Similarly, a poll done by workplace design and planning firm Unispace found that being perceived as less committed to the job is the top concern about working remotely among employees in Singapore. As many as 36 per cent of employees here expressed this concern, higher than the 31 per cent global average. Meanwhile, a survey of workers and job seekers in Singapore done by human resource solution agency Randstad in late 2023 found that half the respondents said they would leave jobs that require them to work in office more frequently. And it seems that Singapore workers have stronger feelings about remote working compared with their global counterparts, according to a separate study in 2024 by human resource consultancy Mercer: Several employees who were reluctant to return to office full-time told CNA TODAY that they did not feel less productive when working from home. An employee at a multinational cybersecurity firm, who wanted to be known only by her initials TR, said that she and her colleagues feel they are able to do more work at home. “In the office, it's often noisier. People come by your desk to ask you questions, which is very distracting. It's troublesome having to look for available meeting rooms or phone booths, and you have to waste time commuting back and forth every day,” said Ms TR, who is in her 30s. Ever since her company strictly enforced a four-day work-from-office regime early last year, motivation among employees has dropped and some of her colleagues have even left, she added. While productivity and remote working may go hand in hand for employees like Ms TR, some research suggests otherwise. For instance, Forbes reported in August 2023 a 10 per cent to 20 per cent decrease in productivity for fully remote workers, citing a working paper by Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, whose findings were not peer-reviewed. Another paper by the University of Chicago in 2023, based on an analysis of 10,000 skilled professionals in a technology company, reported that productivity fell between 8 per cent and 19 per cent among remote workers. Locally, an analysis by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), published in its October 2023 macroeconomic review, found there was an increase in employees' output. This is as the workers saved time from not having to commute and channeled these savings to work. The analysis noted that there was not enough data to assess the productivity benefits of hybrid work arrangements, which may differ from pure remote work. And while hybrid working – which combines remote work with in-office work – has been touted as offering the best of both worlds, it also comes with its own set of challenges, according to professional networking platform LinkedIn. “Our latest survey reveals that over one-third of professionals in Singapore are struggling to communicate efficiently in hybrid work environments,” said Ms Feon Ang, managing director for LinkedIn APAC. In the meantime, co-working spaces have evolved their offerings as demand for office space increases. JustCo, for example, saw a 19 per cent increase in enquiries – from both individuals and companies – between January and October this year as compared with the same period in 2023. "While companies in Singapore are increasingly asking employees to return to office, there will likely still be an uptick in demand for flexible workspaces," said a spokesperson. Catering to this trend, the firm launched JustCo SuperPass in June last year, a cost-saving plan that allows companies to grant office access to additional employees on an ad-hoc basis without paying for long-term workstations. The seemingly short-lived enthusiasm for remote working among employers comes at a notable juncture in Singapore, as the government is making strides to encourage flexible work arrangements amid perennial concerns about the nation’s tight labour market, ageing workforce and the fact that more workers are taking on caregiving roles at home. In April, MOM announced that all employers must have a process in place for workers to make formal requests for flexible work arrangements from December, when new tripartite guidelines come into effect. While employers have the right to reject such requests, the decision should be backed up by reasonable business grounds such as cost or productivity considerations, the ministry said. Given how many companies said during the pandemic that their remote working arrangements were not affecting productivity, the recent and sudden about-turn by a series of big employers raises one big question: Why now? From cost considerations to reducing headcount to promoting staff integration, these are some of the reasons cited by human resource and business experts as well as companies themselves for doing away with remote working in the past year or so: Both Amazon and Grab, in announcing their return-to-office mandates, said in-person collaboration, as observed during hybrid work arrangements, had been beneficial for the company. And so, to further enhance this, the companies decided to double down on the number of days in office. Group CEO of recruitment firm Reeracoen, Kenji Naito, noted: “For some roles, particularly where immediate responses are required or tasks aren’t easily measured, working from the office facilitates more streamlined communication.” Such interaction is even more important for small and young companies. Mr Bryan Tay, Singapore country manager for fintech platform Lendela, said: “We need to create a culture from scratch and cultivate trust, understanding, and a deep belief in our mission, which is much harder to do over a screen.” Lendela was founded in 2018 and currently has over 50 employees in Singapore and other markets. Since its founding, it has practised full-time work from the office, except during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Being together in the office allows us to build stronger connections, share ideas organically, engage in real-time problem-solving, and respond quickly to opportunities and challenges,” said Mr Tay. It is normal for companies to constantly review their policies and strategies from time to time, including those relating to employee location, said experts. Economist Song Seng Wun said that companies would have had hired workers during or soon after the pandemic. With the growing number of employees who have not had a chance to meet each other in person regularly, it may be an added impetus for some companies now to call them back into the office. “Workers come and go. Ultimately companies don’t want a situation where their employees are working with people they have never or hardly met,” said Mr Song, economic adviser for financial service provider CGS International. Mr Naito of Reeracoen added: “We've observed that junior employees with less experience and employees without clearly defined quantitative targets may face challenges working remotely. “Junior employees often require more direct supervision and mentorship, which can be limited in remote settings.” One often-heard argument for maintaining flexible working arrangements is that a company that fails to do so risks losing good employees. “However, some companies might see this as an opportunity to streamline their workforce, which could align with their goals of optimising headcount,” said Mr Lewis Garrad, partner and career business leader for Mercer Asia. Interestingly, some of the companies calling their workers back to office, such as Grab, Disney and Amazon, are also those that have recently made headlines for retrenchment exercises. Indeed, one of Amazon’s top executives reportedly told employees that if they had problems complying with the mandatory return to office policy, “there are other companies around”. Bamboo HR’s survey in June found that a quarter of vice-presidents and C-suite executives and 18 per cent of HR professionals surveyed in the US admitted hoping for “some voluntary turnover” when they implemented mandatory return-to-office policies. But experts also noted that a forced return to office policy may be too blunt a tool to trim headcount. Assoc Prof Theseira said some companies may see it as "not necessarily a bad thing" to lose employees who are unwilling to return to office and whom they perceive as less committed. "But there is this argument that they might be losing their best staff, because their best staff have the ability to quit and then find a job elsewhere," he said. Experts added that many other factors influence a company’s decision to mandate a return to office. While some argue that enforcing office-based work would drive away talent, Lendela told CNA TODAY that its retention rate this year so far is 88 per cent across all its offices, and 87.5 per cent for the Singapore office. By comparison, a poll by market research firm IPSOS in January found about three in 10 workers in Singapore intend to leave their employers within two years. A separate study by professional services firm EY in July 2023 found 45 per cent of workers here had plans to change jobs within a year. In Lendela's latest monthly employee satisfaction survey – done anonymously and online – its workers gave an average rating of 86 per cent in terms of happiness. Meanwhile over at another startup BigFundr, which also stopped practising remote work after the COVID-19 period, one employee, Mr Imran Johri, found work-from-office a refreshing change from the purely remote arrangement in his old company. “Those work-from-home years were the most challenging for me (in terms of productivity) as I have three young children who simply see my presence as the licence for constant engagement,” said Mr Imran, who is marketing director at BigFundr. Nonetheless, he admitted that a hybrid arrangement would be ideal, as it would allow him to meet his caregiving responsibilities for his children and family too. Some experts highlighted the high real estate costs here as an additional motivation for companies to bring their workers back to the office to “justify” their spending on rents. “The high cost of office space in Singapore means companies with large offices may feel the need to bring employees back to fully use their space,” said Mr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy, Asia, at Unispace Singapore. “The cost of keeping empty offices can push businesses to focus on in-office work, making it a financial decision as well as a cultural one.” While companies make their own calculations in setting any policy or strategy, it is also normal for them to take a look at what others in the industry are doing and take that into consideration. Ms Shalynn Ler, Singapore general manager for recruitment firm Ethos BeathChapman, noted that companies are operating under great economic uncertainty and face huge pressures from shareholders. “It is easy in such circumstances to be very reactive and herd mentality sets in, where companies start to mirror what other big firms and industry leaders are doing,” she said. Assoc Prof Theseira of SUSS said that it “seems true anecdotally” that if a certain big company does something, then a smaller one would tend to follow suit as well. It also applies to measures that are seen as unpopular but otherwise financially necessary – such as retrenching workers, raising prices of products, or even changing work practices. “The natural tendency of management globally is always to do it, because they are looking after the bottom line. But it's just that the company may not want to do this (yet), if they are going to be the first,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. Ms Ang from LinkedIn noted that businesses globally are “facing headwinds and rapid change”, prompting companies to reconsider a whole range of decisions, from investments to operations. Though the latest MOM figures indicate that although the labour market in Singapore is tight – the unemployment rate is low and there is a scarcity of workers to fill roles – sentiment has been bleak. Retrenchments more than doubled in 2023 from the year before. Earlier this year, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the labour movement said they were expecting more layoffs until the end of 2024. Furthermore, as more organisations adopt work-from-office as the default arrangement, even if there are more jobs available, employees seeking flexible options may have fewer choices, according to some experts. “This trend could potentially decrease the bargaining power of workers who prefer remote or hybrid models,” said Mr David Blasco, country director at Randstad Singapore. Simply put, companies which want to revoke work-from-home benefits may have to worry less about their employees leaving. Ms Sam from Grab said that her salary lags behind her peers, but the flexible work arrangement has “somewhat made up for it – or at least delayed my departure”. She intends to leave, but it may not be so straightforward now. “And I think the company knows this as well, the job market isn’t that great. So maybe many of us won’t be able to find better options anyway,” she said. As much as the launch of flexi-work guidelines by MOM seems a step in the right direction, experts pointed out that companies can quite easily reject employees' requests for these arrangements with simple and general justifications, such as by saying that they need all workers to work in the office full-time due to operational reasons. “There is an overarching concern that the framework's reliance on employer goodwill and competitive pressure, rather than strict enforcement, could limit its impact,” said Mr Blasco of Randstad. In response to queries after the guidelines were announced, MOM said that errant companies would be counselled and be given warnings if they do not consider their employees’ flexi-work requests fairly. Mr Blasco said what may be a bigger deterrent to companies considering a full turnabout from remote or hybrid work arrangements is the potential reputational cost. “Ultimately, the organisation's policies will significantly shape its culture and long-term reputation," he said. He added that given how any negative perception of a company can be “particularly stubborn to change”, it would benefit the companies to really think through their workplace policies before implementing them. Some companies currently operating in the office full-time, like the startup BigFundr, are well aware of this. “It is with that in mind that we are now looking into our version of a more flexible work arrangement,” said its founder and CEO Quah Kay Beng. He added that they are “keen to allow for (flexi-work) to be part of our work culture” as soon as the company of 14 employees grows in size and efficiency. Experts also generally agreed that even as some companies require their employees to return to office, it does not mean the end of flexible work arrangements. “The initial enthusiasm for 100 per cent remote work may evolve into more nuanced approaches to flexible work that are better suited to each company’s operational needs,” said Mr Naito of Reeracoen. Ms Ler of Ethos BeathChapman said in the long term, the future of flexi-work arrangements in Singapore would also be influenced by the norms of the bigger economic markets such as the United States, United Kingdom and China. “If it becomes more common in those bigger economies globally for employers to revert to offer-based work policy, for instance, Singapore will likely follow suit,” she added. Furthermore, if Singapore excels in flexible-work arrangements, it could serve as a competitive advantage for the nation. The experts noted that the MOM guidelines, though not legally binding, signals that the government recognises the importance of flexi-work arrangements. Thus, it is unlikely that such arrangements will disappear entirely in the future. And even if companies believe they can afford to scale back on certain flexible work arrangements now, they are likely to reevaluate their position once the job market cycle shifts and becomes more of an employee's market again, and they face challenges in attracting talent in the future, experts said. The economists also noted that the labour market is cyclical – it may favour employers for a period of time, but will return to being an employees' market when talents become scarce and companies have to compete with each other for headcount. “It wouldn't be surprising if at some point in the future, you have one market player doing this big, flashy (flexi-work) thing and say: 'We offer all this hybrid work and so on, as an attempt to recruit people’,” said Assoc Prof Theseira.

Title: DC making contingent plans for INTEL crisis...
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/11/01/2024/concerns-grow-in-washington-over-intel
Time Published: 2024-11-01T19:00:03Z
Full Content:
Policymakers in Washington have grown worried enough about chipmaker Intel to begin quietly discussing scenarios should it need further assistance, beyond the billions in government funds the company is already slated to receive, people familiar with the matter said. A strong quarterly earnings outlook yesterday bought the company breathing room with investors, but abstract concerns in Washington have turned into potential backup options, should Intelâs finances continue to deteriorate. Top officials at the Commerce Department, which oversees implementation of the CHIPS Act funding to reinvigorate American chip production, and members of Congress including Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lawâs leading champions, have discussed whether the company needs more help, the people said. The talks, which the people described as purely precautionary, show that Intel is seen as too strategically important to be allowed to fall into serious trouble. The US is seeking a national champion in the semiconductor space to ensure its own supply chain and as a counterweight to China, where manufacturing for global chips has moved. âWe have outlined a clear strategy that we are executing with rigor, and the strong operational performance we delivered in Q3 demonstrates important progress against our plan,â an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. âIntel is the only American company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips and is playing a critical role to enable a globally competitive semiconductor ecosystem in the US.â One option is a merger, led by the private sector but possibly encouraged by the government, of Intelâs chip-design business with a rival like AMD or Marvell, the people said. Thereâs little appetite for a 2008-style bailout, in which the government took direct stakes in automakers and banks, because policymakers are worried about losing money given Intelâs continued sales declines. Intel is set to be the biggest recipient of government funding under the CHIPS Act, which aims to help American manufacturers of key tech components build their products in the US and compete with China. The company is slated to receive $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in low-interest loans; these funds would not be part of any further assistance, should Intel need one. But Intel hasnât received any of that CHIPS money yet amid doubts about its prospects. Bloomberg reported that the company has been reluctant to share certain information sought by US officials tasked with ensuring that the company has a viable turnaround plan. Intel suspended its dividend in August to preserve cash and said it would lay off about 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-cutting effort. It is the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, after Walgreens. Credit ratings agencies downgraded the chipmaker this summer, increasing its borrowing costs. On Thursday, Intel reported a $16.6 billion net loss largely due to writedowns and other restructuring charges and updated its planned layoffs, increasing them by about 10% to 16,500 employees. But it gave a better-than-expected revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, and shares rose 6% on Friday morning. On Intelâs earnings call Thursday, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is on track to begin producing its most advanced chips, known as 18A, next year. Intel is different from other US chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm because it has always built its chips at its own facilities, known as âfabs,â instead of outsourcing production to Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere. But Intel made strategic mistakes, causing it to fall behind rivals. With CHIPS Act funding, the US aimed to encourage Intel to revitalize its production capabilities. A successful launch of the 18A generation chip â something many in the industry doubted the company could pull off â would put Intel back on par with industry leader TSMC. Amazon last month made a multi-billion-dollar commitment to buy a new custom-designed AI chip from Intel that will be built using the 18A process. And on the earnings call Thursday, Gelsinger said two more âcompute-centric companiesâ have agreed to use 18A. âWe have confidence in Intelâs overall vision for manufacturing chips in the United States,â a Commerce Department spokesperson said âWe continue to work closely with the company to finalize their award and will provide further updates as they become available.â Warnerâs office declined to comment. Gina Chon contributed to this report In this article: Itâs surprising Intel stayed at the top of the market as long as it did. It set the rules of its own game with co-founder Gordon Mooreâs âlawâ that the number of semiconductors on a chip will double about every two years. That was in the 1960s. It still has nearly 80% market share for CPUs a half century later. But like many big, old companies, Intel had trouble staying ahead of younger, more nimble competitors. It failed to adapt to changes in the chip industry and fell victim to the innovatorâs dilemma. It makes sense for the US government to try to salvage the situation and to prop up a ânational championâ in the chip space. America is in a high stakes race for technological superiority over China, which subsidizes its private-sector efforts. Bringing chip production âfabsâ back to the US solves the immediate dilemma of supply chain vulnerabilities and the possibility of China taking control of TSMCâs Taiwan headquarters, where most of the worldâs leading-edge chips are manufactured. The longer term problem is that the US government forgot how to spearhead innovation in key areas. For instance, itâs ironic that one of Intelâs competitive threats is from Arm-based processors, which are slowly gaining market share in PCs and data centers. Arm is based on an architecture called Reduced Instruction Set Computer, or RISC. DARPA spearheaded its development by funding a nascent research project at UC Berkeley in the 1970s. It ultimately became one of the seminal breakthroughs in that era of computer science. Arm (Advanced RISC Machines), was co-founded in the UK by Apple and Acorn Computers in 1990. It became essentially the foundation for most of the microprocessors in your life, from your car to your smartphone. There is now even an Arm China. The open system that allows US innovation to prop up non-US competitors only works if the US keeps innovating. The question is whether the government â hampered by divisive politics â can produce the next Intel, or the next RISC-based processor. Or the next breakthrough in lithography to leapfrog current semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett argued last week that splitting up Intel makes no sense: âWeâve seen this movie before. Years ago, a struggling AMD split off its manufacturing capacity into Global Foundries. Pundits applauded the split at the time. A decade later, AMD is doing well using TSMC, while Global Foundries has little if any differentiated technology. Global Foundries just didnât have enough research and development (R&D) budget, and with limited production and revenue, struggled to keep up with market leaders. The economic reality is that it takes massive investment to drive Mooreâs Law. In todayâs semiconductor industry, only three companies (Intel, Samsung, and TSMC) have sufficient revenue to contend for technology leadership. If you split up Intel, the foundry portion will probably fail because of decreased R&D spending along with the complex realities of splitting up a huge multinational company in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort.â âIntel is on the verge of completing an unprecedented pace of node development to catch up to TSMC. It has taken the lead on next-gen technologies that will shape the semiconductor industry for years to come, such as high NA EUV lithography and backside power delivery. Yes, more work is neededâbut this is a good start, and they must keep going.â Intelâs wobbles may force Washington to choose between two of its ideological priorities: promoting national champions and preventing corporate consolidation. On a clear day, thereâs little chance antitrust regulators would allow Intel to merge with any of its rivals. Expediency often forces policy compromises â see JPMorganâs emergency rescue of First Republic last year â but if Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo can outmuscle Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, it will show just how deep Intelâs problems run.

Title: AI drives a cloud resurgence, but it’s costing a lot

UPDATED 13:18 EST / NOVEMBER 01 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Generative artificial intelligence is driving a resurgence in cloud spending, as earnings results from Amazon Web Services and Google this week both saw upside from forecasts. Even Microsoft’s disappointing Azure revenue forecasts came from not having enough infrastructure to support more business, a factor Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also mentioned — and excessive demand isn’t a bad problem to have, as problems go. But at the same time, there’s a big price: Spending to keep up with AI demand continues to be expensive, as Meta’s results also showed this week. Meanwhile, money keeps pouring into AI companies such as Elon Musk’s xAI and Bret Taylor’s AI agent startup Sierra Technologies as well as more industry- and task-specific startups. And new AI models and services keep getting churned out from OpenAI, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Salesforce and everyone else you can think of, with no slowdown in sight. The big one this week: OpenAI’s much-anticipated ChatGPT search. I’m sure it will be interesting, but don’t be ridiculous, it’s not going to put Google out of business anytime soon. Intel got a rare boost by reporting a more positive quarter and outlook than expected and its stock rose 10%, though it remains in a deep hole — another sign of which was Nvidia replacing it on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today. But AMD’s outlook sent investors to the exits. Supermicro’s financial situation looks so bad to its auditors that they exited stage left, tanking the server provider’s stock to the tune of 33%. Its earnings report next week should be … interesting. Indeed, next week is another big week for earnings reports, especially from chip companies such as Arm, Qualcomm, NXP Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries, as well as bellwethers such as Cloudflare and Datadog and a raft of software-as-a-service companies. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend, for some lean-back reading. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: On big data: At TechCrunch Disrupt, there was a illuminating session called Beyond Snowflake and Databricks: Insights from the Frontlines of Data Transformation that indicated the big-data wars will continue for a while longer. One reality, noted Jordan Tigani, co-founder and CEO of MotherDuck, which makes a cloud analytics database, is that “AI people and database people tend not to like each other very much. We’re going to need new tools to power AI/ML engineers.” And the open data formats that Snowflake and Databricks are ostensibly touting? “Things are moving more slowly toward these open data formats than people expect,” he said. “Catalogs are a mess right now. Snowflake and Databricks are slow-walking the building of the open-source versions.” As a result, he said, “the community needs to be stronger” in getting providers to become more open. “The reason people are moving to Iceberg is to remove lock-in or just lower cost,” he said, but both of those reasons are “lower priorities than other things,” like just getting the jobs at hand done. In fact, contended Colin Zima, co-founder and CEO of the business intelligence platform Omni, Snowflake and Databricks “will actually diverge further over time. Databricks is underinvested in all the analytics problems and Snowflake will struggle to become an AI company. It’s very hard to overhaul your DNA.” On what’s coming next in AI: At Constellation Research’s CCE 2024 conference, the firm’s analysts weighed in on the next impacts of AI. VP and Principal Analyst Doug Henschen noted that only 21% of enterprises they surveyed are meeting their goals for generative AI. The problem, he said, is a lack of data, in particular clean data. “Data access and cleansing will be key in 2025.” Constellation Insights Editor in Chief Larry Dignan says generative and agentic AI are starting to transform the enterprise software business model. “In the next year or so, the whole way you buy software is going to change,” he said. Andy Thurai sees a lot of companies cutting corners on making sure AI is under control. “AI will produce AI to monitor itself. There’s no going back if that happens,” he said. “Lawyers are going to have a field day.” Liz Miller noted that “the lesson we’ve learned over the last several years of generative AI is when you automate bad processes, you still have bad processes.” She thinks “knowledge” will be the next frontier in 2025, not just big data. “Right now we’re drowning in data but dying of thirst,” she said. Constellation founder Ray Wang said the key question coming is at what points in AI-driven processes that humans get inserted. They all did a lightning poll on AI budgets next year and, surprisingly, most said AI budgets will be flat or worse. Did someone say trough of disillusionment? But others such as Barney Pell, venture partner at Radical Ventures, are more optimistic. “This time it’s real in a way it hasn’t been,” he said about AI. But he sees the proper focus not on artificial general intelligence but humans plus AI — and also neural networks plus symbolic systems, not just gen AI. The biggest issue? trust. “Most enterprise projects fail because no one trusts them,” he said. One promising avenue I touched on a bit in last week’s This Week in Enterprise came up again in a somewhat different way: the need for AI systems to be trained on more than just language. Denise Hold, founder and CEO of AIX Global Media, a sort of AI startup promoter, said spatial web technologies that are programmable, based on sensory information, are being developed to create a “grounding level of reality.” AI adviser Cassie Kozyrkov had the quote of the week, on the difference between machine learning and AI: “If it’s written in Python, it’s probably machine learning. If it’s in a PowerPoint, it’s AI.” Breaking Analysis: Generative AI adoption sets the table for AI ROI Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly in talks to raise new funding on $40B valuation Insider raises $500M in funding for its personalized marketing platform Generative AI agent startup Sierra Technologies raises $175M at $4.5B valuation Read AI lands $50M in new funding as it strives to become everyone’s AI copilot AI contact center provider Regal closes $40M round to scale personalized customer interactions Zenity raises $38M to secure enterprise AI copilots and low-code app development Brightwave raises $15M to accelerate financial research with AI Diffblue raises $6.3M for autonomous AI-powered test generation platform Report: Chinese researchers used Llama 13B to build chatbot optimized for military use OSI clarifies what makes AI systems open-source, but most ‘open’ models fall short White House limits AI and chip investments to China over national security concerns Nvidia needs EU approval to buy AI startup Run:ai, regulators say OpenAI adds LLM-powered search engine to ChatGPT Apple releases first batch of Apple Intelligence features, debuts new iMac Alexa AI upgrade delayed to 2025 as Amazon hits major roadblocks GitHub Copilot goes multimodel, adding support for Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude LLMs Salesforce launches Agentforce AI agent platform into general availability Nvidia hands out blueprints for the creation of scalable ‘AI factories’ Google reportedly developing new AI that can automate web browsing tasks in Chrome Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features Meta reportedly developing custom search engine for its Meta AI chatbot Amazon Q introduces AI-powered inline chat directly in the code editor for developers Dremio throws its support to Polaris data catalog and expands deployment options for Iceberg lakehouse Pegasystems moves the needle on generative AI development with Pega Infinity updates Creatio combines multiple AI types in new release of its no-code platform Moveworks taps agentic AI to aid in enterprise search Patronus AI debuts API for equipping AI workloads with reliability guardrails TigerEye’s new AI Analyst offers enhanced decision-making in sales and revenue operations Securiti launches Genstack AI to enhance secure enterprise generative AI adoption Tabnine unveils AI developer ‘coach’ with personalized code review agent There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Alphabet’s stock jumps as cloud fuels strong revenue growth Also: Russia hits Google with astronomical fine over YouTube bans That’s a lotta rubles.

Title: Prime Day boosts Amazon sales, membership in Q3

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Product sales were strong, but third-party seller services, advertising and subscriptions grew by double digits in the period. Spurred in part by its summertime Prime Day sale, Amazon on Thursday reported that Q3 online store sales rose 7.2% year over year to $61.4 billion and physical-store sales rose 5.4% to $5.2 billion. Growth of services in the e-commerce giant’s retail business was especially solid. Product sales grew 7% to $67.6 billion, while third-party seller services rose 10.3% to $37.9 billion, advertising grew 18.8% to $14.3 billion and subscriptions grew 10.9% to $11.3 billion. The giant AWS cloud services business, which underpins Amazon’s profitability, helped drive net income growth of more than 55% to $15.3 billion, per a company press release. Several analysts took note of the robust operating margins in Amazon’s Q3 report. At Amazon’s cloud unit, which is benefiting from AI and all its potential, operating margin topped 38%. But, while AWS and its international segment posted all-time highs in that metric, there were strong operating margins across the company’s business segments in the third quarter, according to research from William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden. Operating margins were also given a boost by Amazon’s layoffs in recent years. Though most cuts were made about a year ago, workforce reductions continued into this year, including at AWS and in customer service, warehouse operations and Buy with Prime. Based on their job postings monitor, UBS analysts deem the margin upside from a leaner headcount “durable,” according to a Friday client note. There were also other strengths in retail. For example, the 7% product-sales expansion was the best growth in six months, boosted by summer’s Prime Day, according to emailed comments from GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. “This is always a big event for Amazon but, despite even tougher competition from other retailers jumping aboard the discount bandwagon, Amazon remained the focal point and pulled in more shoppers than ever,” he said. “Some of this is down to consumers being more receptive to discounts, but some is also because Amazon has fine-tuned the deals it offers to ensure they are relevant and compelling. This aids conversion.” The company’s Prime membership “remains a core contributor to this growth,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts Thursday, noting that Prime Day boosted paid membership growth, which accelerated in the U.S. and abroad in Q3. While AI is critical to the progress at AWS, Amazon also touted AI-powered initiatives in retail, including shopping tool Rufus, which rolled out to U.S. customers earlier this year and is becoming available in Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and the U.K.; shopping guides that simplify product search; Project Amelia, an AI assistant for sellers; and video generation and live image capabilities for advertisers. Perhaps even more important to Amazon’s retail operation is its refinements in fulfillment and delivery, increasingly aided by robotics. Improved inventory placement in Q3 helped drive down costs in the company’s fulfillment network, which led to “better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box,” Olsavsky said. “The reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us ... to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today,” he said, noting that in a new Shreveport, Louisiana, facility the company now has “very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow.” In retail, Amazon is also benefiting somewhat from “some of the slip-ups of other retailers in more essential categories, such as locking up products or deteriorating the store experience,” according to Saunders. Customer service, curation and other aspects of a good store experience are crucial to insulating retailers from the stiff competition from Amazon, experts say. That’s true not just of specialty retail but also everyday goods, Saunders said. “While it is only happening at the margins, these things are pushing more people to shop for everyday products on Amazon — with many of these new converts becoming regular and loyal customers in essentials categories,” he said.

Title: Google employees pressure costumed execs at all-hands meeting for clarity on cost cuts

BREAKING: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fires defense minister Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Alphabet executives, donning Halloween costumes, faced questions from concerned employees at an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, following comments on the company’s earnings call suggesting that more cost cuts are coming. “There is a reality to it,” said Brian Ong, vice president of Google recruiting, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by CNBC. “We are hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” Ong, who was specifically responding to a question about retention and promotion opportunities, added that fewer positions are open and geographic hiring has changed, “so you may see fewer roles available where you are.” A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The meeting came after Alphabet reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue Tuesday, sparking a rally in the stock. On a call with investors, CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who recently succeeded Ruth Porat, proclaimed she wanted to “push a little further” with cost savings across the company. Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wore a starfish costume to the meeting, while Ashkenazi sported a jersey of former Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller. CEO Sundar Pichai wore a black t-shirt that read “ERROR 404 COSTUME NOT FOUND” with an image of a pixelated dinosaur. Ashkenazi said one of her key priorities in the new role would be to make more cuts as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2025. It’s a theme that began in 2023, when the economy and market turned, and has continued since. Google has been restructuring its workforce to move more quickly in the AI arms race, where it faces increased competition. That’s included layoffs, organizational shake-ups, and has led to workers feeling a “decline in morale,” as CNBC previously reported. Over the last couple of months, Google has made cuts to its marketing, cloud and security teams in Silicon Valley, as well as in its trust and safety unit. Google is far from alone. Dropbox this week announced it will lay off 20% of its global workforce, while Amazon continues shuttering various projects. Within Google, employees have expressed concern that the company is preparing for more layoffs, possibly after the end of the year, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Pichai joked that the quarterly call was perfect preparation for Ashkenazi ahead of the company meeting. “I was telling Anat yesterday, earnings calls are a piece of cake compared to TGIF the next day,” Pichai said, to laughs from attendees. Some employee comments and questions included praise for “another great quarter,” success in chip advancements and improvements in Google’s hit AI note-taking tool NotebookLM. However, other questions expressed fear of what greater cost efficiencies would mean for the workforce. “What exactly was meant by the comments on further efficiencies in headcount”? one question asked, pointing to Ashkenazi’s comments from the call. Ashkenazi didn’t share any more details but said employees are “one of the most important assets we have.” She said that the company is investing in people and that it hired 1,000 new graduates in the third quarter. Pichai, who’s been preaching efficiency for almost two years, chimed in to echo past sentiment. “If you have to do something new and it’s going to take 10 people, if you can find a way to do it with eight people by making smart trade-offs somewhere and aligning teams better, that’s an example of finding efficiencies in headcount as well,” Pichai said. In response to another question about ongoing layoffs and reorganizations and what might be coming in the future, Pichai said, “If we are making companywide decisions, we’ll definitely let you know.” He said the company is spending heavily on AI at the moment, but the need to ramp up those expenses won’t last forever. “We are going through an extraordinary period of capex advancement,” Pichai said. “When you have these technology shifts, at the earlier stages, you invest disproportionately and then the curve gets better and that’s the transition as an industry we are working through.” He added that not all of the cuts are decided on by top executives. “It’s not like all of these decisions are centrally done at a company level,” he said. “And so, at the scale of our company, there could be moments where there are small groups of people impacted.” Ashkenazi on Tuesday mentioned that one way to get more cost efficiency is by using AI internally. The company said 25% of new code is now generated by AI. In response to a question about productivity, Brian Saluzzo, head of “Core” developers, said that while the 25% refers to low-level tasks, leadership is in the midst of “expanding to more complex areas” within the company. “Core” refers to the teams that build the technical foundation underlying Google’s flagship products. In May, CNBC reported that Google laid off more than 200 employees from its Core engineering teams, in a reorganization that included rehiring some roles in India and Mexico. Pichai followed up by saying, “In this transition moment, across all functions, everywhere in the company, it’s worth challenging us to think where we can use AI to be more productive.” He added that through 2025, the workforce should “strive to do more” and “help customers around the world take those learnings as well.” Jennifer covers Google parent company Alphabet Inc. and Silicon Valley culture for CNBC.com in San Francisco. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Report: Big Media Companies Are Increasing Their Spending On Content

According to a report from Ampere Analytics, over half of all content spending in 2024 will come ... [+] from six companies. Disney leads in total content investments. Netflix ranks first with spending on streaming content. Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Earlier this week, Ampere Analytics, a U.K.-based research and analytics company focusing on media and content released its latest report on content spending. Among the key findings was the combined spending of six companies; Disney, Comcast, Google (YouTube), Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and Paramount Global content spend will total $126 billion in 2024, a year-over-year increase of +9%. In a first, the six companies will now account for over half (50.6%) of total content spending. By comparison, last year, the six companies accounted for 47.5% of content spend. With reports the era of Peak TV, which saw a steady increase in the number of original scripted programming had peaked; Ampere reports that since 2022 spending on original content from the six companies had totaled $56 billion, accounting for 45% of total spending. Peter Ingram, research manager at Ampere Analysis said, “We can expect that the content landscape will see low-level growth in 2024 as production schedules recover from disruptions caused by the pandemic and the writers’ and actors’ union strikes.” Ingram added, “Looking forward however, overall growth in spend is set to plateau as companies look to refocus their output. This will include limiting commissioning volumes and prioritizing strategic investments and profitability to counter the current challenges of the media market.” Ampere found as viewers migrate away from linear television that content companies are investing more on their streaming platforms. This year $40 billion will be invested on streaming including content from Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of the total spend. Among the six companies Disney is the top spender on global content. In 2024 Disney is expected to spend $35.8 billion accounting for 14.4% of the total. Earlier this year, Disney’s attained total ownership of Hulu after negotiations with Comcast were finalized. The addition of Hulu added an estimated $9 billion in content spend. Furthermore, Disney continues to be the largest provider of television and film content worldwide accounting for 14% of the total. For the year, Comcast ranked second in content spend at $24.5 billion (9.9% of total spend) Google ranked third at $17.6 billion 7.1%), followed by Warner Bros. Discovery at $16.8 billion (6.8%). In a reversal from last year, Netflix will now rank fifth with $16.0 billion (6.4%) surpassing Paramount Global at $15.1 billion (6.1%). Ampere noted that Paramount’s investment in original; content has slowed this year. In addition, non-U.S. original content will account for 40% of Paramount+ and 52% for Netflix. Production costs outside the U.S. tend to be lower. Earlier in the year Ampere reported Netflix and Amazon over a full quarter had ordered more than half of their titles from outside the U.S. Ampere noted since the pandemic, Netflix has become the leading content spender among streaming platforms with an average investment of $14.5 billion per annum. The dollars are expected to increase as Netflix has invested in live sports. Starting this year through 2026, Netflix will be live streaming an NFL Christmas Day doubleheader. Also, next year, Netflix will become the new home of WWE Raw. The report noted that Google’s content investment is derived from YouTube and investment in programming via their revenue-sharing arrangements with content creators. While different from other content investors, the streaming platform has been building a strong presence globally in agreements with major content providers. As a result, YouTube has emerged as the third largest content spender. The increase in content spending comes at a time when several streaming services launched during the pandemic are starting to become profitable or at least have cut their losses. The increase in content spending also coincides at a time when several media companies, looking to cut their losses, have been cutting back on other units including a series of personnel layoffs.

"There is a reality to it," said Brian Ong, vice president of Google recruiting, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by CNBC. "We are hiring less than we did a couple of years ago." Ong, who was specifically responding to a question about retention and promotion opportunities, added that fewer positions are open and geographic hiring has changed, "so you may see fewer roles available where you are." A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The meeting came after Alphabet reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue Tuesday, sparking a rally in the stock. On a call with investors, CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who recently succeeded Ruth Porat, proclaimed she wanted to "push a little further" with cost savings across the company. Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wore a starfish costume to the meeting, while Ashkenazi sported a jersey of former Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller. CEO Sundar Pichai wore a black t-shirt that read "ERROR 404 COSTUME NOT FOUND" with an image of a pixelated dinosaur. Ashkenazi said one of her key priorities in the new role would be to make more cuts as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2025. It's a theme that began in 2023, when the economy and market turned, and has continued since. Google has been restructuring its workforce to move more quickly in the AI arms race, where it faces increased competition. That's included layoffs, organizational shake-ups, and has led to workers feeling a "decline in morale," as CNBC previously reported. Over the last couple of months, Google has made cuts to its marketing, cloud and security teams in Silicon Valley, as well as in its trust and safety unit. Google is far from alone. Dropbox this week announced it will lay off 20% of its global workforce, while Amazon continues shuttering various projects. Within Google, employees have expressed concern that the company is preparing for more layoffs, possibly after the end of the year, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Pichai joked that the quarterly call was perfect preparation for Ashkenazi ahead of the company meeting. "I was telling Anat yesterday, earnings calls are a piece of cake compared to TGIF the next day," Pichai said, to laughs from attendees. Some employee comments and questions included praise for "another great quarter," success in chip advancements and improvements in Google's hit AI note-taking tool NotebookLM. However, other questions expressed fear of what greater cost efficiencies would mean for the workforce. "What exactly was meant by the comments on further efficiencies in headcount"? one question asked, pointing to Ashkenazi's comments from the call. Ashkenazi didn't share any more details but said employees are "one of the most important assets we have." She said that the company is investing in people and that it hired 1,000 new graduates in the third quarter. Pichai, who's been preaching efficiency for almost two years, chimed in to echo past sentiment. "If you have to do something new and it's going to take 10 people, if you can find a way to do it with eight people by making smart trade-offs somewhere and aligning teams better, that's an example of finding efficiencies in headcount as well," Pichai said. In response to another question about ongoing layoffs and reorganizations and what might be coming in the future, Pichai said, "If we are making companywide decisions, we'll definitely let you know." He said the company is spending heavily on AI at the moment, but the need to ramp up those expenses won't last forever. "We are going through an extraordinary period of capex advancement," Pichai said. "When you have these technology shifts, at the earlier stages, you invest disproportionately and then the curve gets better and that's the transition as an industry we are working through." He added that not all of the cuts are decided on by top executives. "It's not like all of these decisions are centrally done at a company level," he said. "And so, at the scale of our company, there could be moments where there are small groups of people impacted." Ashkenazi on Tuesday mentioned that one way to get more cost efficiency is by using AI internally. The company said 25% of new code is now generated by AI. In response to a question about productivity, Brian Saluzzo, head of "Core" developers, said that while the 25% refers to low-level tasks, leadership is in the midst of "expanding to more complex areas" within the company. "Core" refers to the teams that build the technical foundation underlying Google's flagship products. In May, CNBC reported that Google laid off more than 200 employees from its Core engineering teams, in a reorganization that included rehiring some roles in India and Mexico. Pichai followed up by saying, "In this transition moment, across all functions, everywhere in the company, it's worth challenging us to think where we can use AI to be more productive." He added that through 2025, the workforce should "strive to do more" and "help customers around the world take those learnings as well."

Title: Stock market today: Microsoft, Meta and the burden of expectations knock Wall Street sharply lower

Drops for Big Tech companies including Microsoft and Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms led Wall Street lower NEW YORK -- The downside of high expectations thumped Wall Street on Thursday, and Microsoft and Meta Platforms dragged U.S. stock indexes lower despite delivering strong profits for the summer. The S&P 500 sank 1.9% for its worst day in eight weeks and fell further from its record set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 378 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% for a second straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. Microsoft reported bigger profit growth for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped forecasts, but its stock nevertheless sank 6% as investors and analysts scoured for possible disappointments. Many centered on Microsoft’s estimate for upcoming growth in its Azure cloud-computing business, which fell short of some analysts’ expectations. The parent company of Facebook, meanwhile, likewise served up a better-than-expected profit report. As with Microsoft, that wasn’t enough to boost its stock. Investors focused instead on Meta Platforms’ warning that it expects a “significant acceleration” in spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing artificial intelligence. It fell 4.1%. Both Microsoft and Meta Platforms have soared in recent years amid a frenzy around AI, and they’re entrenched among Wall Street’s most influential stocks. But such stellar performances have critics saying their stock prices have simply climbed too fast, leaving them too expensive. It’s difficult to meet everyone’s expectations when they’re so high, and Microsoft and Meta were both among Thursday’s heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Amazon and Apple also helped drag the market lower, with Amazon falling 3.4% and Apple dropping 2% before they released their profit reports after trading ended for the day. They’re the latest companies in the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to do so. Earlier this month, Tesla and Alphabet kicked off the Magnificent Seven’s reports with results that investors found impressive enough to reward with higher stock prices. The lone remaining member, Nvidia, will report its results later this earnings season, and its 4.8% drop was Thursday’s heaviest weight on the market after Microsoft. Expectations are just as high for the chip company after its stock soared over 880% in the last two years. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the last six, even though it set an all-time high during the middle of it. Such a big move might have been overdue following an unusually long and placid run, according to Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. He pointed to how the S&P 500 had failed to move by 1% in a day in either direction, without accounting for rounding, for the longest stretch in nearly three years. Still, Thursday wasn’t a complete washout thanks in part to cruise ships and cigarettes. Norwegian Cruise Line Holding steamed 6.3% higher after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cruise ship operator said it was seeing strong demand from customers across its brands and itineraries, and it raised its profit forecast for the full year of 2024. Altria Group rose 7.8% for another one of the S&P 500’s bigger gains after beating analysts’ profit expectations. Chief Executive Billy Gifford credited resilience for its Marlboro brand, among other things, and announced a cost-cutting initiative. Oil-and-gas companies also rose after the price of a barrel of U.S. crude gained 0.9% to recoup some of its losses for the week and for the year so far. ConocoPhillips jumped 6.4%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 108.22 points to 5,705.45. The Dow dropped 378.08 to 41,736.46, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 512.78 to 18,095.15. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends after ignoring food and energy costs were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields swiveled up and down several times following the reports before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of last month. Yields have been rising following a string of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. Such data bolster hopes that the economy can avoid a recession, particularly now that the Fed is cutting interest rates to support the job market instead of keeping them high to quash high inflation. But the surprising resilience is also forcing traders to downgrade their expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes sank across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.5% for one of the larger losses after North Korea test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to hit the U.S. mainland in a move that was likely meant to grab America’s attention ahead of Election Day. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech’s latest earnings show the AI spending spree isn’t over

Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…Big Tech is increasing AI spending… OpenAI drops its foundry ambitions… Wall Street boosts AI infrastructure… and AI models give inaccurate voting info. Quarterly earnings are in for Microsoft, Meta, and Google, with Amazon’s on the way tonight. Those who reported so far made one thing clear: They’re about to amp up spending on AI even more. Of course, most of this investment will go to infrastructure like Nvidia chips and data centers. Nvidia isn’t set to announce its Q3 earnings for another month, but it will be another telling one to watch for the pulse on the AI boom. Meta said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 as it accelerates its infrastructure investments. The company raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion. “Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call yesterday. Meta is currently working on the next version of its Llama model and is continuing to position itself as an AI company—all while relying on ad revenue from its social media platforms to foot the bill. To bridge the gap, Zuckerberg framed AI as a win for its core ad business. He said its advancements in AI are making it possible to better predict what content users want to see, leading to 8% and 6% increases in time spent on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Microsoft posted positive growth for its AI business, reporting that it’s on track to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue run rate in the current quarter and will be its fastest product category to reach that milestone yet. Additionally, the company disclosed details of its investment in OpenAI for the first time in a quarterly regulatory filing, painting a picture of massive losses on the other side of its AI bet. In the filing, Microsoft stated it’s made $13 billion in total commitments to OpenAI. This, however, didn’t include the additional $750 million the company reportedly invested in OpenAI’s latest funding round at the beginning of October (the filing quarter ended Sept. 30). Besides its overall investment, Microsoft also disclosed the toll its bankrolling of OpenAI is taking on its profits. The company said that losses from its stake in OpenAI were part of the reason it had a $683 million expense on its equity investments for the quarter. On AI, Google touted how the boom has boosted its cloud business. But even more interestingly, CEO Sundar Pichai said AI is writing over 25% of new code at the company, but engineers still review the work before using it. While the rest of the AI-related earnings statements from the companies were somewhat predictable, I would’ve loved to hear more detail about the programming by AI. Google did not respond to my questions about what this looks like in process, including what types of coding projects it’s found AI is best suited for (or not so great at) and if it’s shipped anything coded by AI yet. AI is increasingly not only the product, but also making the products too. On future earnings calls, will we hear that increased efficiency of AI coding (or layoffs of expensive engineers) are boosting profits? And with that, here’s more AI news.

Request your invite here. OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to create its own AI chips. Reuters reported that OpenAI has dropped its ambitions to create its own foundries—the name for factories that produce semiconductors—due to the immense cost and time that would be required. Instead, OpenAI has been working with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference for several months and, through Broadcom, has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The AI firm plans to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026, but sources told Reuters the timeline may change. OpenAI is also tapping commercially available chips from AMD, further rounding out its plan to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. AI power and data center projects get a $50 billion boost from Wall Street. Investment giant KKR and private equity group Energy Capital Partners are working together with tech companies to accelerate their access to electricity required for AI and will make a combined $50 billion in investments over the next four years. Doug Kimmelman, founder and senior partner at Energy Capital Partners, told the Wall Street Journal that “[natural] gas is going to be at the forefront of this.” The insatiable energy demands of AI continue to be one of the largest issues with the technology. Over the last several weeks, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all announced investments in nuclear energy as they search for a more environmentally-friendly way to power their AI. AI designed to identify people who need help paying their water bill offers big discount to one of the city’s richest customers instead. The water bureau of Portland, Ore., piloted a machine learning algorithm designed to predict customers' ability to pay and then offer discounts to those who are struggling. One of the first customers the algorithm targeted, however, was Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle, who said he received notice he was being given a 40% discount even though he has no trouble paying his water bill. Boyle earned more than $1.6 million last year and holds Columbia shares worth more than $1.7 billion. “I don’t want the discount—they should give it to somebody who needs it,” Boyle told local news outlet Willamette Weekly. The Portland Water Bureau approved $350,000 for the contract for the pilot with contractor SERVUS.

The stock was up about 7% on Friday morning. Here are the results. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report: In cloud, Amazon Web Services revenue was a hair below consensus estimates, but it's growing faster than the same period last year. Sales grew 19% during the quarter compared to a year ago when sales accelerated by 12%. The company was navigating slowing growth in its cloud business last year as customers trimmed their budgets due to heightened economic concerns. AWS is still growing at a slower rate than its top challengers. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services at Microsoft came in at 33%, and Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased nearly 35%. Amazon's capital expenditures surged 81% year-over-year from $12.48 billion to $22.62 billion as it continues to invest in data centers and equipment like Nvidia GPUs to power its artificial intelligence products. Amazon has launched several AI products in its cloud and e-commerce businesses, and it's also expected to announce a new version of its Alexa voice assistant powered by generative AI. The company's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call that the majority of the company's 2024 capex spending is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company plans to spend about $75 billion on capex in 2024 and that he suspects the company will spend more in 2025. "The increase bumps here are really driven by generative AI," Jassy said during a call with analysts. "It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity," he said, noting that shareholders "will feel good about this long term, that we're aggressively pursuing it." Advertising was another bright spot in the report. Sales in the unit expanded 19% year over year to $14.3 billion during the quarter, outpacing growth in Amazon's core retail business. Amazon and Apple, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, round out a busy week of earnings for the top tech companies. Alphabet on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results, driven by cloud growth. Microsoft issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, leading to the stock's steepest selloff in two years, while Meta beat estimates but warned of significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses next year. Among online ad companies, Amazon showed the strongest growth, although its ad business still remains a fraction the size of juggernauts Meta and Google. Meta's advertising revenue grew 18.7% year over year, while Google's advertising business increased 15% in the quarter. Snap's sales jumped 15% from a year earlier. Amazon forecast revenue in the current quarter to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, which would represent growth of 7% to 11% year over year. The midpoint of that range, $185 billion, fell short of the average analyst estimate of $186.2 billion, according to LSEG. Operating income during the third quarter grew 56% year over year to $17.4 billion, showing that Amazon's focus on efficiency and continued cost-cutting continues to lift the bottom line. Jassy has been laser-focused on trimming expenses across the company, cutting more than 27,000 jobs since the beginning of 2022. Amazon has continued to restructure its teams this year. Wall Street has applauded Jassy's campaign to rein in expenses, with Amazon shares up about 23% year to date. The Nasdaq has gained roughly 27% over the same stretch. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Peloton appoints Apple Fitness+ co-founder, now Ford executive, as its next CEO

Peloton has appointed its next CEO NEW YORK -- Peloton has appointed its next CEO. Peter Stern, co-founder of Apple Fitness+ and a current Ford executive, will soon helm of the tech-fitness company. Stern takes over as president and CEO on January 1, Peloton said Thursday. Karen Boone, one of two current interim CEOs, will continue to serve as chief executive through the end of the year, the company said. Shares for the New York company climbed more than 20% Thursday. Thursday's announcement arrives nearly six months after Barry McCarthy stepped down as Peloton’s chief executive. His departure in May came alongside larger restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the company, which included the layoffs of hundreds of employees. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of COVID-19, when many consumers turned to at-home workouts, but that all slowed as pandemic restrictions eased. As a result, the company has reported losses in more recent years. Peloton also reported Thursday that it lost $900,000 during its first quarter on revenue of $586 million. Both were better than Wall Street had expected. In efforts to turn things around, Peloton has been working on rebranding itself for some time — shifting its identity as a seller of luxury exercise bikes and equipment to health technology for all. The company recently unveiled plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at a discount at Costco this holiday season. And back in 2022, Peloton made its exercise bikes and other gear available on Amazon in the U.S. In a statement Thursday, Stern called working for Peloton “a dream come true" — adding that he is grateful for the opportunity "to take Peloton and its Members to even greater heights.” According to the company, Stern himself has been a Peloton member since 2016. He currently serves as president of Ford Integrated Services — and previously also held leadership roles at Time Warner Cable and Apple, where he co-founded Apple Fitness+. In connection with this week's announcement, Chris Bruzzo, who has been serving as Peloton's co-interim CEO alongside Boone, will step down on Friday. But both Bruzzo and Boone will remain members of Peloton's board. Stern is also expected to get a seat on the board. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech's vanishing perks have left employees to face a stark new reality

Boo! Did I scare you? If not, maybe this will surprise you: Microsoft disclosed an equity investment in OpenAI for the first time, SEC filings show. It could hint at an evolution in their relationship, as the tech giant previously described their deal as "a long-term partnership" in filings. In today's big story, Big Tech is pulling back on the freebies for its employees. What's on deck: But first, is this free? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Use it. Don't abuse it. That's the hard lesson tech workers are learning about their jobs' free perks, Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly, Rob Price, Hugh Langley, and Sydney Bradley write. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on the freebies. It's part of a broader push to cut costs across the industry. Those efforts took center stage recently when Meta fired employees for misusing Grubhub credits. Instead of buying food, people used the perk for things like laundry detergent and wine glasses. Employees everywhere have been known to bend the rules with work benefits. A Citibank employee was fired after expensing business trip meals he eventually admitted were for his partner. The difference for tech might be how widespread the perks are. Tech companies have gone out of their way to fully subsidize almost everything for their employees. It's not charity. The perks help recruit and retain talent and keep employees working at the office. (Free lunch at the office means more time spent working there.) A tech giant's pullback on one work perk is causing an uproar. Amazon's new return-to-office mandate, which requires employees in the office five days a week, continues to face pushback from its workforce. More than 500 employees signed a letter sent to Amazon Web Services' CEO Matt Garman criticizing his support of the policy, BI's Jyoti Mann and Ashley Stewart write. While speaking at an all-hands earlier this month, Garman said nine out of 10 Amazonians he spoke to were "actually quite excited about this change." Remote work made it harder to innovate and collaborate, he added. Some Amazon employees aren't buying it. In the letter to Garman, they said the lack of hard numbers backing up the decision "fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues." The true benefits and downsides of remote work are hard to nail down. Some studies have shown workers are more productive when working from home. Another conducted last year found remote work can stifle innovation. It's not all bad news for Amazon employees, though. When contacted by BI about the letter, a company spokesperson said in some cases Amazon would offer resources to employees like elder care and pet sitters. In other words, perks.

By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst It’s been a tough year for the games business, with thousands of layoffs and game cancellations roiling the industry. Is there room for a new company emerging from stealth to tackle the AAA console and PC space? The leaders of Delphi Interactive are making a big bet they can make their mark on the sector as an independent player. Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard and president Andy Kleinman joined Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast to discuss their AAA-first business model, which kicked off with IO Interactive’s upcoming “Project 007,” and revealed their hiring of former Nordisk Games CEO Mikkel Weider as Delphi’s managing partner in Europe.

Weider joins a team that Daugaard and Kleinman say counts seasoned talent with experience at EA, Rockstar Games and Microsoft Gaming’s roster of publishers. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: Until now, Delphi hasn’t made a peep about the company’s ambitions since “Project 007,” a James Bond origin story, was first announced in 2020. The game is being developed and published by IO Interactive, the company behind the long-running “Hitman” franchise, in association with Delphi, which is licensing the Bond intellectual property from producer Barbara Broccoli’s Danjaq holding company and MGM (Despite Amazon acquiring the latter in 2022, Amazon Games is not involved with “Project 007”). IO Interactive hasn’t revealed much about the game or its release window, but Daugaard sees “Project 007” as representative of Delphi’s mission, which includes a slate of unannounced projects. “In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard says. While IO Interactive remains the sole developer of “Hitman” and currently publishes it as an independent entity, that wasn’t always the case. The Danish studio spent more than a decade as a Square Enix subsidiary before its management buyout in 2017, a year after rebooting “Hitman” in 2016. IO Interactive then published “Hitman 2” in 2018 through Warner Bros. Games before going solo for “Hitman 3” in 2021, eventually repackaging all three games into its “World of Assassination” offering, which continues to add content and update the game for players. It’s the rare example of a predominantly single-player, AAA experience that has extended its shelf life well past its initial release window, which is typically when such games make the brunt of their sales. But as much as heralded AAA franchises like “The Last of Us,” “Uncharted” and “Fallout” have produced Hollywood hits, it’s often a different case when reversed. “Marvel’s Spider-Man” may be a PlayStation powerhouse, but 2024 has seen high-profile games like “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League” and “Star Wars Outlaws” flounder. Warner Bros. Discovery wrote down a $200 million loss for its gaming division on the “Suicide Squad“ title, bringing its “Hogwarts Legacy” victory lap to an end, while Ubisoft delayed its next “Assassin’s Creed” game in response to “Outlaws” falling short of sales expectations (Ubisoft is reportedly exploring a sale to Chinese tech giant Tencent). “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP,” says Daugaard. “They’ve also become fundamentally misaligned more and more with independent AAA developers. And that’s where Delphi saw an opportunity, a significant opportunity, to step in and offer a sort of very attractive alternative to owners of IP and to AAA developers.” Kleinman says Delphi has been “inspired a lot“ by companies like Legendary Entertainment. “Their whole thesis was that they could come in initially with financing, but their plan was to try to make these big blockbuster films outside of the legacy Hollywood studios,” he says. “Skydance came later and built a similar thesis, which has now become really big, and now they’re taking over [Paramount Global] to try to modernize it with their way of doing things. But that doesn’t exist in gaming, and especially in AAA gaming.” According to Daugaard, major publishers are “no longer ideal partners” for the biggest third-party IP, on account of what he and Kleinman believe is a prioritization of their wholly owned IP. He has a point. Leading live-service platforms have stepped in as lucrative partners to major Hollywood studios. Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games in 2024 to build IP-driven experiences on “Fortnite,“ while Universal and Warner Bros. partnered with Roblox to promote films like “Kung Fu Panda 4,” “Despicable Me 4,” “Godzilla x Kong” and “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” that hit their marks at the box office this year. Likewise, two of the Big Five movie studios — Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. — exist alongside full-fledged gaming divisions within their corporate parents. As Kleinman points out, that could become three if Skydance completes its acquisition of Paramount due to Skydance Interactive and Skydance New Media, though the latter division does have AAA Marvel and Star Wars games in the works. The significance of mobile gaming, which comprises half of the global video game market, shouldn’t be ignored either. Companies like Scopely, where Kleinman was once chief business officer, thrive on licensed IP, so much so that Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group for $4.9 billion in 2023 after the success of “Monopoly Go!” Before Scopely, Kleinman worked at mobile giant Zynga, which went to “Grand Theft Auto” parent Take-Two Interactive for $12.7 billion in 2022. Kleinman also worked at Disney Interactive some years before Disney CEO Bob Iger closed the division in 2016. Kleinman doesn’t seem fazed by the challenges involved in licensing major intellectual property. “When Disney or Warner Bros. or any of these studios are thinking about the strategy for some of the biggest IPs, it’s not just one thing that they do,” says Kleinman. “They explore different ways to attract the different types of fans [who] are engaged with that IP… Some of those fans are the audiences that are within Roblox and Fortnite and who want to have those games. They’re very engaged with those games… We think about the single-player, story-driven experience, and usually it starts with something that you know can be played in 12 to 16 hours, as opposed to 80 to 100 hours, and you feel a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you’re playing it.” As Daugaard puts it, “It’s natural that everybody wants a Fortnite. There’s an 11- or maybe even 12-figure upside to that, if you can pull that off.“ On the other hand, he adds, it’s also “a very volatile proposition with a massive downside, a massive risk.” For instance, Sony Interactive Entertainment is scaling back Playstation’s push into live services after “Concord“ was pulled from release less than two weeks after launching in August, resulting in the decision Tuesday to shutter its developer Firewalk Studios. An online game for “The Last of Us” was also cancelled last year and serious adjustments were made to “Destiny 2,” the once-thriving live service that helped make the case for Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie, in 2024. SIE cut 220 roles at Bungie and moved additional personnel to other PlayStation studios. The same day Firewalk was closed, EA announced competitive shooter “Apex Legends“ would undergo “large systematic change“ after an update missed expectations. Daugaard sees the evolution of “Hitman” as providing a reliable template for extending a gaming franchise, as opposed to creating a live service from scratch. “You have this strong core single-player experience, and then you carefully layer on live-services elements around this core, and then you expand in… these concentric circles from there and create a single-player-as-a-service that can be a very, very good business and very durable,” says Daugaard. “We think that is a more organic approach than launching a super expensive, mega live-services game and hope that people will show up.” “We are seeing a lot of great independent talent that we want to partner with, that want to partner with us some, because they’re looking for an alternative to these traditional publishers,” says Kleinman.
