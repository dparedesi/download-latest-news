BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.

Title: Entertainment and Media Layoffs Up 18% With Over 17,000 Jobs Slashed in 2025

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A wave of consolidation, AI-driven change and cost-cutting pushed entertainment and media layoffs sharply higher in 2025 After a slight dip in layoffs in 2024, the entertainment and media industry jobs suffered through another difficult year. In 2025, over 17,000 jobs were cut across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming in the first 11 months of the year. This figure was up 18% from last year, continuing a trend from the past few years as the industry has wrestled with consolidation and other pressures like the double strikes in 2023. News alone, including broadcast, digital and print, suffered 2,254 job cuts to date, 179 of which occurred in November, but for the year, cuts were down 50% from the 4,537 job losses announced during the same period last year. The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation, according to Challenger. This summer the FCC officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, leading to layoffs across the Paramount entertainment business. Disney laid off hundreds this year, as part of CEO Bob Iger’s 2023 initiative to cut costs amid an audience migration away from cable TV subscriptions to streaming platforms. A World Economic Forum survey also found that 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI’s ability to handle more more complicated tasks have led to companies cutting jobs, although the actual return on investment of AI tools has been disappointing. Correspondingly, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. As AI cements itself into everyday life, digital media companies struggle. Sites that relied heavily on SEO and search are having to adapt strategy, leading some to shutter, like Teen Vogue. Layoffs across Condé Nast and Penske-owned properties removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations as a result. And PBS lost federal funding under President Donald Trump, forcing it to cut 15% of its staff. These job losses underscore a more broadly weaker job market, with November seeing more than 71,000 layoffs overall, the second highest over the last five years, behind only the 2022 cuts, according to said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also noted that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from year-end layoff announcements. From 2010 to 2017, the media industry lost 7,305 jobs per year on average, according to Challenger’s data. Since 2018, the average number of annual job cuts has jumped to 14,298. There is one industry in the entertainment business that is growing, though: the creator economy. As other industries shrink, the digital creator industry has only grown in 2025. From 2022 to 2024, L.A. employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, employment in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. The microdramas business has also grown this year, employing Hollywood production crews, nonunion actors and writers to create bite-sized, bingeable episodes that turn a profit. In just four years since the launch of these vertical dramas, the genre’s market has surpassed $8 billion globally, according to Media Partners Asia. Below is a look back at a grisly year that is increasingly becoming the norm for the news and entertainment industries. The entertainment industry suffered thousands of job losses this year as industry consolidation and contraction hit companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. The FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger in July, placing the company under CEO David Ellison’s hands. During the last quarter of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reviewed bids to sell its holdings. It accepted Netflix’s offer, but Paramount has continued to put pressure on the company to accepts its bid. However the bidding war plays out, any deal will result in layoffs, although the timing could stretch into 2027. As Hollywood continues to lose out on productions to the U.K. due to incentives overseas and the rising cost of shooting in Los Angeles, the industry has also taken a hit. Some of the major job cuts to hit Hollywood this year included: Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal are each planning to spinoff their cable linear assets next year. With Comcast’s creation of Versant, NBCU laid off 7% of the workforce at NBC News and more employees from the television sector of the business, with Versant trading at the beginning of 2026. Under the leadership of Gunnar Wiedenfels, Warner Bros. will house its traditional TV networks under the independent “Global Networks” company. This split will go into effect later in 2026 under the accepted Netflix bid. Paramount is still pursuing the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, and said it expects to wring out $6 billion in merger-cost savings over the next three years. Analysts predicted at least 6,000 job losses, echoing Disney’s 2019 Fox acquisition downsizing. On-location production in the greater Los Angeles area, meanwhile, declined 13.2% from July through September compared to the same period last year, according to FilmLA. Only 157 theatrical films, television shows and movies, and streaming projects shot in Los Angeles County were completed and released in 2024. That’s down 14% from the 183 projects recorded in 2023 and the 228 recorded in 2022 amidst the production backlog caused by COVID. While Hollywood remains the leader in global film and TV production, the gap continues to steadily narrow while an estimated 41,000 entertainment jobs in Los Angeles have been lost over the past five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past,” FilmLA Vice President of Communications Philip Sokoloski said. “Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.” With the impending threat and continued implementation of AI in the newsroom, media companies have made tough decisions to best fit their financial needs and maintain relevancy. Several news organizations took hits as they pivot to keep up with audiences shortening attention spans and growing content sources. The cuts came amid a broader wave of layoffs throughout 2025. CBS News laid off about 100 people in October, weeks after NBC News laid off roughly 150 people. Condé Nast also cut multiple staffers last month through layoffs at Teen Vogue and the firings of four staffers who protested the cuts. Penske staffers suffered a wave of cuts at Variety, Rolling Stone and Billboard just weeks before the holidays. The layoffs at PMC organizations also come after the company removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations in October for those who would not comply. There was a distinct rise in AI-driven layoffs this year, with the technology accounting for nearly 55,000 job cuts, according to data from Challenger. Since its introduction, AI has offered to replace workers and perform the jobs of many at a lower cost, vastly changing how employers value their employees and how secure workers feel in their roles. Amazon laid off 14,000 employees in October. CEO Andy Jassy claimed the cuts were not necessarily driven by financial or AI factors though the company’s initial memo to staffers said the company needed to meet “this generation of AI.” Microsoft similarly cut 15,000 jobs throughout the year, providing a variety of explanations for the cuts. Both companies have invested heavily in AI tools. AI’s integration into the newsroom has not been seamless for all — see the Washington Post’s AI-generated news podcast — but media organizations are leaning into the technology as a tool to keep up and compete. New York became the first state to require employers to disclose when AI is the reason for layoffs this year as more companies seek the technology out as a way to increase work efficiency and potentially cut entry level roles. “Currently, AI aids news workers rather than replaces them, but there are no guarantees this will remain the case,” a report from Columbia University’s journalism school said earlier this year. “AI is sufficiently mature to enable the replacement of at least some journalism jobs, either directly or because fewer workers are needed.”

Title: Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/12/streaming-report-card-2025-1236651338/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Dade Hayes, Katie Campione After more than five years of gushing red ink, 2025 was the year when streaming across the board started to turn a profit. There are caveats attached to that statement, of course. NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone. With that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late. In 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.” Watch on Deadline Streaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched its own flagship, Fox One. While profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation. Below, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces. 2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too, via a distribution deal with Warner Bros. 2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device. Challenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are reported as part of Apple’s overall services business, lumping them in with music, cloud storage and other operations, but the streamer clearly seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues. Biggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works? 2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well. 2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney. Challenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution. Biggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026? 2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that uphill climb has gained a big tailwind with the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence. 2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While senior execs gamely tried to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster. Challenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook. Biggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon. 2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix. 2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure. Challenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming. Biggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output. 2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing. 2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops. Challenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential. Biggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it? 2025 Highlight: Love Island USA. Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced. 2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line – aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad. (NBCU execs said at a press briefing this month that the spots will not interrupt the live action but will look to draft off them when a break comes.) Challenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives. Biggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it. 2025 Highlight: The twin home runs of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double-digit growth. 2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment. Challenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099. Biggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.

Comment Name Email Website Δ There are too many major streamers now, okay. Peacock needs to go away, Comcast has failed. When HBO Max merges with either Netflix or Paramount+, that will leave an array of streamers that can survive just fine. If Apple wanted to be in the big leagues, they would need to produce the kind of schlock Netflix does. Bottom feeding “documentaries” about serial killers, frothy romcom fantasy, teen angst, supernatural horror. Prestige drama about rich white people behaving badly and head-scratching sci fi will only get you so far. I hope Apple doesn’t start slumming. We have enough of that. If no longer reporting subscriber numbers, Streamers still have to report the specific income from the service itself, no? Could you not do the math to at least estimate how many subscribers they are getting from that? For Paramount, is Star Trek no longer a factor? South Park is mentioned over this? I know that there has been some criticism of Star Trek shows, but it can’t be that bad. Are people that stupid they can’t keep up with streamer rebranding? Do they really care? It’s like saying people are confused by the difference between an apple you eat and the company that makes phones. Speaking of Apple, how many are getting Apple streaming for free by buying an Apple product? Do they offer free subscriptions when doing so? Here is a possibly odd question: What, if anything, does it cost a streamer to run and maintain the servers providing subscribers their content 24/7? We are now hearing about AI data centers resulting in consumers paying higher electric bills. Are not streaming “data centers” somewhat the same even if not as energy hungry? Is raising subscription prices partly due to running these centers? Is canceling, or even removing, content few, if anyone, is watching, a way to save money by recycling wasted space? Has anyone thought of this? You’d have to also estimate ARPU, which varies throughout the world. For Netflix, ARPU in Asia is about half that of North America. So if Netflix adds a lot of Asian subscribers but doesn’t report subscriber figures, regional breakdown or regional ARPU, then guestimating their figures becomes dicey. And then add in the ad-based tiers, which on the surface is less revenue but actually more when you add in the ad revenue. Ad tiers are generally more lucrative than ad-free ones, which is why the streamers push them. The kind of servers Netflix has, just to serve up video, are much less power intensive than AI servers. Platforms remove content in order not to pay licensing fees on that content. The server space is a small consideration. However, Disney’s move into user generated AI content suggests that AI type servers will become far more of a factor in the future. I expect user generated content to make inroads into all the platforms, except for Apple, because prestige content without big franchises doesn’t mesh with AI nearly as well as the opposite. Star Trek has been terrrrrrible under Paramount’s watch. Strange New Worlds is all right, mainly due to good casting, but becoming stale. Nepo needs to clean house and start over with a new team. In my dreams, he hires Tony Gilroy… Apple is very generous with the free subscriptions. This year I suddenly got three free months for having a Roku TV, which was not new either so I was confused but happy to take the freebie. Streamers raise prices to whatever the market will bear. They will stop only when it causes churn in excess of the benefit of the price hike. This is true of every other business too. Prices are not set by the cost of goods. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $99 to make, the price is $100. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $1 to make, the price is $100. These streamers might be able to keep viewers attention if they didn’t wait so long between seasons. For example stranger things now has full blown adults on the show when they started out as kids. My attention span moves on if I can’t go back to a show within a reasonable time span without having to refresh my memory. The biggest elephant in the room. Short attention spans, social media and YouTube…. Yup. When everything finally shakes out I dont expect to see more than three to five streamers left standing. Ultimately Peacock can’t survive on its own, and it’s possible Paramount can’t either. Perhaps something happens between those two after Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros.

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton predicts 2026 will see the technology get even better and gain the ability to ‘replace many other jobs’

Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI. “I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton replied. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.” He added that AI’s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before. That means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month’s worth of labor. “And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI.” Earlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology’s dangers. “I’m probably more worried,” he answered. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.” If an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained. To be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he’s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives. “But along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don’t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,” he warned. Some AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there’s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing. “They may think there’s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we’re not going to not do that good,” he said. “For driverless cars, they will kill people, but they’ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.” Hinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work. In October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he told Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week. While some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level. A recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI. And in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system. “It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,” he told the Financial Times

Title: Several factors affecting success for job hunters in Lehigh Valley

Sherri Skok wants to work full time. But she is having trouble finding a company that wants her. The 61-year-old Easton resident has a resume with plenty of experience as a personal assistant/chief of staff in corporate offices, including two decades at Barnes & Noble. Apparently, it’s not enough — or it may be too much — for a long list of Lehigh Valley businesses that have advertised openings. Skok has kept a list of them; places where she’s interviewed and was subsequently rejected. Some of them couldn’t be bothered even to send a reply after they talked, which is referred to as “ghosting.” Many others simply didn’t reply to the application, which these days are mostly filled out online. Skok, who has found part-time employment since talking to The Morning Call in early November, said she probably filled out more than a thousand applications, including about 50 since moving to the Lehigh Valley this year. She says she’s received at least one interview for about a quarter of them. “I apply for jobs, and maybe I’m not 100% qualified for or even interested in, just to see where it might lead,” said Skok, who grew up in Macungie and graduated from Emmaus High School and Penn State. “I’ve been aggressive about it. I sometimes spend eight hours a day doing it. I think there has to be an angle [on a job] I’m not considering or maybe I should go about it this way, or let me reach out. There are many, many ways. But it didn’t yield anything.” Her story isn’t unique. Social media has plenty of anecdotes from hard-luck job candidates who have applied to hundreds of them without a bite. Some economists have referred to it as a “jobless boom,” a period of economic growth and high corporate profits that coincides with weak job creation and even layoffs. Michael Rivera, assistant professor of business information systems at Lehigh University, confirmed that Skok has plenty of company. “I think it’s somewhat universal,” he said. Uncertainty about the economy and politics have made some employers reluctant to add workers. “I have spoken to many companies that have funds [to hire, but] that are just hesitant,” Rivera said. “They’re not quite sure where things are going to net out, and it has impacted where they’re looking to make investments.” Additional headwinds for people on the job search are a wave of recent layoffs nationwide with 150,000 workers losing their jobs in October, according to the Associated Press. The cuts are coming from business giants such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Target and UPS that are not only dealing with uncertainty over tariffs, but are also looking at ways to implement artificial intelligence in their operations. “We’re reading about strong layoffs proposed for companies that are happening,” Rivera said. “Most recently, I read an article on Walmart’s CEO that says get ready, every single job is going to change and it’s going to have AI in it. Walmart’s plan is for more revenue without increasing its workforce.” The federal government didn’t release labor statistics during the shutdown, but payroll processor ADP reported private sector companies shed 32,000 jobs in November. According to Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, the region’s unemployment rate was at 4.9%, as of September — the most recent statistics available — with job postings up over the year by 18.9% at 15,700. Nationally, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate fell to 3.2% in October, matching the lowest figure since March 2013, not counting the pandemic. After several years at Barnes & Noble — where Skok said she earned “six figures” — she was terminated in 2019 after the company was sold. “At the end of the day, loyalty doesn’t mean anything because when the company got sold, they eliminated my department just like that,” Skok said. Skok had a complicated job search process that wasn’t helped by the COVID pandemic, which put some promising roles on hold. She did find a chief of staff position with a fitness influencer, but left after questions of financial problems. After that was a year with a small equity firm, but she was let go after a major investor dropped out. To keep her finances on track, Skok sold her home in northern New Jersey “to put money in the bank” and took up residence in Easton to continue the job search. Skok said she’s applied to a “who’s who” of local companies and nonprofits since she moved back to the Lehigh Valley. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour. Two months later, the position still was not filled, highlighting her frustration with even finding a lower-wage position. Cathy Rychalsky, who recently took over as executive director at Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, said there is a lot of frustration among job seekers, many of whom never hear back about their applications. She also said some employers are overwhelmed by the number of applications because many are people who apply to jobs not within their skillset to satisfy unemployment requirements. They simply don’t have the staff to review every application and are forced to use things as AI for screening purposes. Another factor is changes in the labor market since the pandemic as employers can be pickier with the applicant pool. “The pendulum has shifted post-pandemic,” Rychalski said. “During the pandemic, people were able to write their job description and how much they wanted to get paid. Today it doesn’t look like that, and it shifted fairly quickly. It has shifted back where the employer is really driving the car.” What to do? Rivera said that even during the search, job seekers should take command of their growth and development. “That is something that is within their span of control. They can guide that,” he said. “They need to be taking an active approach. If they’re taking a passive one, they really run the risk of having other employees outgrow them.” Rivera said earning another college degree isn’t necessary, but he recommended such things as reading, watching videos and attending seminars to improve skills. Writing a resume for the future, which includes skills and competencies you want to have in three to five years, can be a guide. Old strategies, such as networking and making human connections, are still very effective. It’s OK to use AI in the job search to tailor resumes and cover letters to align them with the job description’s keywords, he said. With companies adopting AI, it’s important to show how job seekers are integrating those tools into their skillsets. “I’ve found that the No. 1 thing that companies are looking for today is adaptability,” Rivera said. “At the moment an employee is hired, they need to be growing with market and industry trends, with their corporate culture, always looking to kind of extend their abilities further and further with new tools and new approaches.” Rychalsky suggested using services such as Pennsylvania CareerLink. She said it’s helpful to talk to someone about the ups and downs of the job hunt. “Having someone who’s on the lookout for you, who is connected to the business community, who can maybe even reach out on your behalf and ask if this person did apply, could they reconsider them?” Rychalsky said. “If we don’t have a connection with that business, we might be able to make that connection. That’s what CareerLink is here to do. It’s here to help the job seekers, and is here to help the business community.” Meanwhile, Skok will continue her search for a full-time position that includes benefits. “It’s not like a one-person flight. There are many, many people in the United States who are facing this right now,” she said. “And they’re good qualified candidates. I just don’t understand how the job market became so overly competitive. I asked myself, do these jobs even exist? Is it a way to take your information? Who knows?” Morning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at ejones@mcall.com. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour.

Title: Nvidia Just Paid $20B for a Company That Missed Its Revenue Target by 75%

If you’ve heard “Grok” thrown around lately, you’re probably thinking of Elon’s chatbot from xAI. We’re not talking about that one. That model isn’t particularly good, but its whole value prop is being politically incorrect so you can get it to say edgy things. The company Nvidia bought is Groq (with a Q). Totally different beast. If you’ve used any high quality LLM, you’ve noticed it takes a while to generate a response. Especially for something rapid fire like a conversation, you want high quality AND speed. But speed is often what gets sacrificed. There’s always that “thinking... gathering my notes... taking some time to form the best response” delay. Groq specialized in hardware and software that makes this way faster. They created a new type of chip called an LPU (Language Processing Unit). It’s based on an ASIC, an application specific integrated circuit. If that’s confusing, don’t worry about it. It’s just a processor that does a specific type of task really well. So imagine you’re talking to Gemini and it takes a couple seconds to respond. Now imagine it responded instantly, like 10 or 100 times faster. That’s the problem Groq was solving. To go one level deeper on LPUs versus GPUs (the processors most LLMs run on, typically Nvidia cards): those GPU calculations have to access a lot of things in memory. Nvidia’s chips depend on HBM, high bandwidth memory. But LPUs use something called SRAM that’s much faster to reference. Think about it like this. Your wife has a grocery list for you. You go to the store but forget the list. Every time you’re in an aisle, you have to call her on the phone: “Hey, do I need anything from the bread aisle?” Get the bread. Put the phone down. Go to the next aisle. “Hey, do I need anything from canned goods?” And so on through produce, meat, pick up the beer, check out, get home. Very inefficient. Groq’s approach is like you just took the list to the store. Get to a new aisle, look at the list. Next aisle, look at the list. Much faster than a phone call. That’s the key difference. Nvidia GPUs are phoning out every time they hit a new aisle. Groq’s LPUs mean the shopper has the list in their pocket. Groq’s main offering is GroqCloud. An engineer like me isn’t going to go out and buy an LPU (I don’t even know if they’re commercially available). What I’m going to do is, if I need lightning fast response in an application I’m building, I’ll use GroqCloud. That inference happens at an extremely fast rate, running on LPUs in a data center somewhere. Their value prop is: fast, cheap, low energy. Where they’ve been falling short is they mostly use open source models. Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS (OpenAI’s open source offering). These are decent models, but nowhere near the quality of something like Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro. Groq positioned themselves for hardcore use cases where milliseconds matter. One of their big industry fits is real time data analysis for Formula 1. When your driver’s out there on the track, you don’t have time to send a query to Gemini and wait 20 to 30 seconds to figure out if you should pit this guy for new tires this lap. You want something like Groq which does pretty good analysis, really really really fast. This is insider baseball you’re going to miss from mainstream news headlines. The media is paying attention to Grok (Elon’s chatbot), not Groq (the chip company). This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s just that the only people aware of Groq are software developers and tech nuts like me. This is a canary in the coal mine for worse things to come in 2026. About a year ago, Groq announced a $1.5 billion infrastructure investment deal with Saudi Arabia. They also secured a $750 million Series D funding round. These are crazy multiples even for a software company that’s somewhat leveraged in hardware. Bubble level projections. To visualize $1.5 billion: if you cashed that check out in $100 bills and stacked them one on top of another, it would reach a five story building. For ordinary plebeians like us, at the average US salary of around $75K, you’d need to work 20,000 years to earn that. At that time, the company was valued at $2 billion. Hello bubble. Then in maybe one of the best rug pulls of all time, in July they quietly changed their revenue projections to $500 million.1 A 75% cut in four months. I’ve never seen anything like that since the 2008 financial crisis. Prefer to Watch the Video This was a company valued at $2 billion, enough that the government of Saudi Arabia was investing at that valuation. Then they took a 75% haircut four months later without anything major happening. If it can happen to Groq, who else can it happen to? Nvidia? Intel? The rumors started flying on Christmas Eve. Confirmed the 26th: Nvidia will be buying Groq, their key product line, and key personnel including the CEO, for $20 billion. Let’s walk through that again: February: $2 billion valuation July: Down to $500 million December: Nvidia buys them for $20 billion after they took a 75% haircut What is going on? This is a bubble. The only explanation is this is a fear purchase. Groq was promising faster, cheaper, more efficient, less electricity use for their chips. But they couldn’t scale fast enough to compete with the vendor lock in and buddy system Nvidia has going. Nvidia’s buying them with their insanely inflated war chest. They don’t want a chunk taken out of their market share. They can’t afford to take that chance. So it’s like they’re just saying: “Shut up, take the $20 billion, walk away from this project.” This is a sign that in order to succeed, Nvidia needs a monopoly on the market. Otherwise they would not pay ten times the company’s valuation that was then decreased by 75%. This is a desperate move to consolidate the market into “you have to go with us.” Saudi Arabia didn’t keep that $1.5 billion sitting around. They redirected it to Nvidia and AMD instead. Nvidia still gets paid ofc. Smaller competitors like Cerebras and Inflection, doing things in Groq’s space or exploring different architectures for AI inference, are canceling IPOs, dropping like flies, seeking emergency funding. The chatter I’m hearing from VCs and friends in that world? Ain’t nobody buying it right now. Google made their own chip. Microsoft and Amazon are racing to make competition chips that run on less electricity, are more efficient, faster. But no matter what anybody does, the market is consolidating around the Nvidia monopoly for AI hardware. Engineers like me and architects at large enterprises are trying to escape this. Once they consolidate enough of the market, they can set their price for chips and usage. If you don’t own them, you go through Oracle or some cloud computing service, and they can charge whatever they want because there will be no competitors. Even a competitor having a rough time but getting some traction? They just buy them out for $20 billion because with this monopoly going, that’s pocket change. $20 billion is a rounding error to Nvidia. The AI infrastructure boom ran on one large errant assumption: that power is cheap and plentiful. That assumption was very, very wrong. We’ve seen parts of the power grid fail, go unmaintained. There’s a great article on Palladium called “The Competency Crisis” that explains some of what’s going on in the US right now. Electricity is now the bottleneck. It’s the constraint. Too expensive or you can’t get enough of it. Who’s paying these costs? The tech companies aren’t. Trump is meeting with Jensen Huang, with Sam Altman. He hasn’t been over my place lately. He hasn’t invited you to the White House to talk about how you can’t afford groceries and eggs cost three times what they did a few years ago. No. You and I are going to pay to subsidize the electricity constraints. US data centers are using about 4% of all electricity right now. If growth continues at the same rate, in ten years they’ll use 9%. Almost one tenth of all electricity generated in the US. I’m not much of an environmentalist. But even someone like me, pretty jaded to some amount of waste because of industrialization, something like this actually makes my stomach turn. In places with lots of data centers, AI heavy regions, they’re experiencing about a 250% increase in energy costs compared to just five years ago. That’s huge. Even compared to grocery costs, which are out of control. At least with food you have alternatives. Red meat too expensive? Buy chicken. Chicken too expensive? Buy eggs. But electricity? You have to run electricity. It’s a public utility. You can’t just “use a lot less” when your bill goes up 2.5x. Let me walk you through what happens. Some business development guy from Oracle wants to build a new data center in Rural America. A year before it’s even built, they meet with city officials, maybe the governor. They grease the right people. Get legislation passed with the utility companies that says they’ll pay a preferential rate for electricity because they’re going to use a shit ton. They’re Oracle or Nvidia, they’re good for it. They pay five years upfront. Then the utility decides what to do with the rest of the electricity. The grid is strained. They want everyone else to use less. They can’t just tell them to use less, so they keep raising the price until naturally you just can’t afford to use more. You turn the lights off. Turn the TV off. Get those LED bulbs that disrupt your sleep. Do everything to keep electricity costs down. But you and I are left holding the bag. The data center folks aren’t paying for that, they paid upfront at a preferential rate. Senate Democrats are allegedly investigating this. I’ll believe it when I see it. These tech companies have their hooks so far into influential politicians. It’s a vote grab. I’d be happy to be wrong about that, but I know I’m not going to be. I talked about this in my last piece on the AI bubble. This computer communism that’s going on, pricing you out of personal computing, keeping it all in the family of these tech companies. But with the Groq deal confirmed, it’s gone one step further. Nvidia is not just selling chips anymore. They are lending money to customers who buy the chips. They are artificially inflating demand. It’s like if I run a small grocery store and I need to show good signal to investors that I’m bringing cash in the door. So I go downtown during farmer’s market and give everybody a $20 voucher to use at my store. I take a wholesale hit when they come in and buy stuff. But what I can show is: “Hey, people are coming in and spending money. Look at the revenue. Give me more venture capital money.” This can’t work infinitely, for the same reason any perpetual motion machine can’t work. Back in September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Coming through in $10 billion tranches over time. And it’s not equity, it’s lease agreements for Nvidia’s chips. Literally paying them to pay themselves.There’s probably some tax shenanigans going on there since they’re typically offering $xxx in leases of their chips to the company they’re “lending” to. Assuming they do this in part because the depreciation on the physical asset (the chips) can be written off on their taxes somehow. They’re essentially incentivizing another person to use them with money. Even OpenAI’s CFO has admitted, quote: “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia.” They’re playing both sides. In the OpenAI case, they’re financing software that uses their chips. But they’re also getting their hooks into data centers. CoreWeave: they have something like 7% share in the company. Worth $3 billion. That’s funded by GPU revenue from CoreWeave. Lambda: another data center operator. That’s a $1.3 billion spending deal. Renting Nvidia’s own chips back from them. They’ve pledged to invest £2 billion across British startups, which of course are going to go back to Nvidia chips one way or another. In 2024, they invested about $1 billion across startups and saw a $24 billion return in chip spend. They 24x’d their billion dollar investment in one year. Nvidia has more power than the Fed right now. More power than the president over the economy. They have their hand on the knob of the economy. They can choose how fast or slow they want it to go. If the Nvidia cash machine stops printing, if they stop funding startups, data centers, hardware companies, software companies, that whole part of the economy slows way down and maybe crashes if investors get spooked. I’m waiting for somebody to blow the whistle on this. I’m not a finance guy, so it’s strange I’m even talking about it. But their entire success story for the next couple years hinges on their $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which they’re expecting to bring back about $300 billion in chip purchases. It’s vendor financing. It’s sweetening the pot on your own deals. I cannot believe more people are not talking about this. OpenAI, the leader of this space, the company whose CEO Sam Altman is invited to the White House numerous times, probably has a direct line to Trump, a lot of the economy hinges on this guy’s strategy, opinions, and public statements. And he runs a company that is not profitable. Actually insane if you think about it. All he’s done with that company, from an economics point of view, is rack up debt. Spent more than he’s earned. By that metric, I’m richer than Sam Altman. Not in net worth. But if I consider myself a business and the fact that I bring in any salary at all, even a dollar a year, that would make me earn more than Sam Altman, who has only lost money. In the next few years, they’re expected to burn something like $75 billion a year. Just set that money on fire. I have a credit card with no preset spending limit, but I assume if I run up a $75 billion charge it’s going to get denied. By their projections, they think they’ll become profitable around 2029/2030, and they need $200 billion in annual revenue to offset their debts and losses. To visualize $200 billion: if you cashed that out in $100 bills and stacked them, it would reach halfway to the International Space Station. That’s how much they’d have to make every single year to just be profitable. Not be a massively successful company. Just to not spend more than they earn. 2024: Spent $5 billion, earned $3.7 billion. Spending $1.35 for every dollar earned. 2025: Set $8 billion on fire (after profits). 2028 (projected): Will lose $74 billion that year. Just lose it. Cumulative losses through 2029: $143 billion. They’d need to make $200 billion in a year to offset that. Are they including interest? I have no idea how these things work, but in simple terms: they’re spending a lot more money than they make. Groq was kind of a one off because Nvidia panic bought the competition. But they also need to figure out how to get prices down or they can’t keep this money machine moving. Groq is probably one of the last companies that caught a good lifeboat off a sinking ship. What we’re going to see this year: it’ll start small, but get major. A company first, then multiple larger ones, that had a 2025 valuation, will go to raise. They’ll do a 409A evaluation. A bunch of smart analysts will say what it’s worth to investors. And you’re going to see the valuation drop. They won’t be able to raise money. Then the shit is really going to start to hit the fan. The dominoes will start falling. That’s probably what kicks off the actual pop, and it’s imminent. Any day now. Part of the big gamble they’ve sold investors is: we’ve got to replace you. The worker. That’s why we need to spend so much money, go into debt. It’ll all be worth it because then we won’t have to pay people to do these jobs anymore. We’re going to continue to see massive labor displacement. To a degree this is a shell game, an investor illusion. What these larger enterprise companies are hoping to do: cut a lot of folks, have big layoffs, say it’s because AI is replacing the jobs. In some cases they’re right. Data entry, for example. I don’t mean to be mean if you do data entry for a living, but there are models very good at that now. You need someone to manage the work, spot check it. But it’s kind of a job AI can do. Like how grocery stores have automatic checkout lines now with one person monitoring six or eight of them. So some of that’s real. A lot of it isn’t though. They cut a bunch of American workers under the guise that AI’s replacing workers. A lot of these megacorp execs are actually convinced of it. Americans are expensive, especially tech workers. Then they see: damn, maybe we could have cut some, but not as many. We got greedy. Now our services are failing in production. AWS in Northern Virginia is flaky, going down again. That just happened, by the way, direct result of these layoffs. So instead they think, “We’ll look globally! Spin up a campus in Hyderabad!” Pay them way less. The cost of living is less there, they expect less. Bring them over on H-1B when needed. I’ve written about the H-1B program. This is nothing against the individuals on that program. I’ve worked with very talented H-1Bs, and some very inferior ones, just like American citizens. But the corporate sleight of hand is something like this, we can get those H-1B visas, and they’re not going to ask for pesky stuff like Sunday off for church. We can put them on call 24/7 and they can’t say no because if they do, we kick them back to their country. Same thing that’s happened with migrant labor in farming over the past century. Even if it doesn’t look like it on the surface, corporations know that they can pay H-1B employees less than American citizens. If a US citizen and H-1B recipient both make $120k but the H-1B works double the hours because they have no room to push back and are under threat of being sent home, they are making 50% less than the American per-hour. Amazon/AWS: 14,000 laid off. Microsoft: 15,000 total just in 2025. Salesforce: My favorite one. 4,000 customer support roles cut. And the CEO is gloating about it in interviews. So great that he can replace workers! Now Salesforce is admitting that they fucked up. They cut too many people. I’ve been on the other side of this when I was an engineering director at a Fortune 500 company. They were neurotic about tracking AI use. Spending an exorbitant amount of money on shitty AI tools. Like tools from a year ago. GPT-4o in the GPT-5 era, in the Anthropic dominance era. More or less useless. Not only would they monitor all usage across employees, specifically who’s using it how much, they could see every single message being sent to the AI. So theoretically you could check somebody’s queries and do a performance evaluation based on where you perceive them to be. Pretty creepy. They’re using yesterday’s tools because of regulation and compliance, blowing an absurd amount of money. The CEO just sees a lot going out the door: “I thought these were supposed to save money, what’s going on here?” So his lieutenants have to get a grip on it, monitor everything. Even at Amazon this is being included in performance reviews, how much they’re using AI. That’s why if you’re a software developer wondering why your boss is on you about using AI tools. They’re probably getting pressure from their bosses. I want my engineers to be as productive as possible. I think AI is probably part of that tool belt for everyone at this point. But is tracking it really the best way? I’m going to gauge performance on metrics, how you interacted with the team, what you shipped. It puts the cart before the horse to say you’re paid by how much you use these AI tools. If I’m a developer, I’m just spinning up a script to send lorem ipsum text 24 hours a day, get maximum ratings because I used GPT-3.5 the most. MIT did a study in summer 2025. They’re saying 95% of companies report zero measurable ROI on AI products. Actually not that crazy if you consider that a lot of them did layoffs and subbed in AI. That’s just going according to plan in my estimation. They estimate about $30 to $40 billion has been spent on enterprise AI. That’s the money your JPMorgan Chase is spending for their engineers to use Claude Code or whatever dated tool they have access to. The market heard that signal. When that study came out: Nvidia crashed 3.5% Palantir down 10% Nasdaq in general down 1.2% That last one isn’t encouraging for an AI bubble pop because it indicates this is a big part of the economy. January through February: Maybe down valuations, just a very flat market without much growth. Q1 to Q2: We’ll start to see a couple businesses, or maybe one major one at first like a domino starting to fall, not able to raise capital at their 2025 valuation. We’ll see valuations go down. VCs will be like: “Not touching it, not giving them more money, cutting our losses.” Then timing a little more indeterminate but these things will happen quickly in succession: Credit markets start to tighten Debt refinancing pressure builds up in the system Nvidia revises its revenue guidance to something at least vaguely linked to reality And that’s when the big reckoning begins. I want to be clear. AI is not going anywhere. It’s going to continue being a mainstream part of the world. I like a lot of these tools, I think they’re very helpful. But the talking heads have really promised us the world. It’s clear the technology cannot deliver above and beyond what it’s doing now. We’ve seen progress of these models slow at an exponential rate of slowing over the past few releases. Each release is better, but the gap between the current release and the last release is much smaller than it used to be. Because of that, a lot of these AI companies are going to survive, but their valuations are going to get giga slashed. Valuations of $500 billion for OpenAI, $42 billion for Anthropic are unsustainable. We’re going to actually see them become unsustainable in 2026 as they’re eventually cut. Smaller companies will face those slashes first. But it’s coming for the major AI labs as well. This is good news, honestly. This AI hype has really turned tech into something different these days, different than it used to be. While I don’t feel AI is going anywhere, I do feel we’ll get a little more back to normal once this bubble pops and resolves. What do you think? Drop a comment below.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2025: From TCS to Amazon — these IT firms laid off over 1,00,000 employees amid AI reshaping market

Amid artificial intelligence (AI) shaping the market, tech layoffs continue to hit workers across the world following a bruising year, in which over 100,000 people lost their jobs. Although the pace of layoffs has slowed slightly over the last few weeks, the impact remains significant, with around 122,549 tech workers being laid-off from 551 tech companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Some of the biggest pink slips came from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Salesforce, Amazon, and Microsoft — collectively affecting hundreds of employees. These job cuts are often linked to artificial intelligence, as companies are looking for ways to cut expenses amid rising costs from inflation and tariffs. In such times, hiring fewer employees and relying on AI can seem like an appealing short-term solution for companies. Several major tech companies have announced large scale of workforce reductions this year. Some notable examples of these layoffs include: — Amazon: The e-commerce giant announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history in October this year, slashing 14,000 corporate job roles, as it seeks to make more investments in its “biggest bets” which includes AI. — Microsoft: The US-based tech giant has cut a total of 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent restructuring announcement coming in July, which saw 9,000 employees losing their jobs. — TCS: India's largest tech company also joined the wave of companies laying off its employees. It announced a 2% reduction in its workforce, equating to nearly 12,000 jobs, which sent shockwaves to the country's IT industry. The company also refused claims that the job losses were due to AI replacement, citing skills mismatch and an evolving business model as the real reasons behind the move. — Intel: The chipmaker announced in July that it had mostly completed cutting 15% of its workforce. Intel had employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, with 99,500 of them classified as ‘core employees’. However, the chipmaker said that it wants to end the year with around 75,000 core employees. — Salesforce: The company's CEO Marc Benioff confirmed in September that 4,000 customer support workers had been cut at the firm with the help of AI. He had revealed over the summer that AI was already doing up to 50% of the work at the company. However, some recent news reports also indicate that alongside these cuts, Salesforce is also planning to hire more staff. — HP: In November, the PC maker said that it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs globally through fiscal 2028 as it aims to streamline operations and integrate artificial intelligence across workflows to speed up product development, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity. — Apple: According to a Bloomberg report, iPhone maker Apple has laid off dozens of sales workers across the United States in November, in a rare job cut for the tech giant. Although the exact number could not be verified. — Meta: As per news reports, Instagram's parent company Meta said in October that it plans to lay off 600 employees in its AI division, with the aim to build new products faster. — Google: The tech giant laid off 100 of its employees in design-related roles in October as part of its ongoing push to accelerate its AI agenda. A month earlier, the company had also reportedly cut more than 200 contractors working on its AI projects, including Gemini and AI Overviews. — Verizon: The US wireless carrier announced in November that it will lay off more than 13,000 employees marking its largest single job cut drive triggered by plans to shrink costs and restructure operations. — Siemens: The German tech firm cut 5,600 jobs at its Digital Industries business in March. The job cuts amount to a little more than 8% of the 68,000 people employed in Digital Industries globally.

And if the author was prepared to pay forty-four bucks for two of them, it just goes to show you that he has more dollars than sense. I’m hoping he made more than that for the article and can chalk it up as an expense. The author got paid for the article. It’s business expense. Re: Hainan The author of that tweet and substack doesn’t seem to understand that for the past 3 decades or so, every business that has sought to sell in China, manufactures in China. Importing has always been a fraught business for any company in China, there are just too many bureaucratic obstacles for anything except raw materials imports. The move to offshore to Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., has been driven by exporters from China, not companies wishing to sell in China. Since it’s just a customs free area for China, it will almost certainly only attract investments from companies already within China, and already selling within China. There may be good regional development reasons for this, but in terms of overall growth, its not likely to generate any real investment – this is why (for example), the Tories proposed Freeports around the UK went nowhere. Most likely, the justification is internal, specifically to complete the weakening of HK and Macau as economic powerhouses. Shanghai has already take up much of HK’s former financial role. There may also be a desire to create an alternative growth pole away from the traditional arc from the Yellow Sea to the Yangtze Delta. If it does indicate a strategic reset towards the western seaboard of China, then the Vietnamese in particular will be looking very closely at how to respond. Oddly enough, the best stats I could find from my neck of woods, only around 8% of the companies that export to China have a subsidiary there – the 92% manufacture somewhere else (mostly here). That is from 2023, so it indeed falls within the last three decades. Already over a decade ago I heard a comment by the CEO of Genelec that “one can’t compete with the Chinese in price, the secret is to make so good stuff the Chinese come and buy it regardless of the price”. “Trump tempers Zelensky’s optimism on peace plan The Hill” links to an Axios article. Here’s the correct link: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5663887-trump-zelensky-peace-plan/ From the Axios article: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Axios on Friday that he hopes to agree on a framework with President Trump for ending the war when they meet on Sunday. Zelensky also revealed he’s willing to bring that plan up for a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days” They just keep playing the “ceasefire” broken record as if the Russians are somehow gonna fall for it if they repeat it long enough. I imagine now that they need a ceasefire to hold the referendum. True brain geniuses in the British government these days. Thanks, fixing. I had considered linking to the Axios piece but its headline claim was bogus. Mercouris has already picked apart Zelensky’s offer that Axios depicted as new (adding the “60 day” specifier does not change the basic idea). “Have Germans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?” The answer is probably no as German media is all in on the propaganda effort and everything that Germans say online is being watched like a hawk with punishment meted out from time to time. Plus alternate views are banned in Germany and the EU such as the Russian RT & Sputnik. I mean here, you may as well ask ‘Have Americans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ or ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ The answers to both questions would also apply to the Germans. Rev Kev: ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise.’ Actually, the majority have, I’d guess. The problem is the media and TPTB relentlessly keep shoveling the sh*t to allow no break in the narrative. such as the Russian RT I’m typing this in a hotel room in Munich. No problem getting RT. You are blessed, channels such as press tv,russia today have been removed from circulation in my tiny and toney part of the collective west. When I’ve visited in Deutschland, MSNBC and Bloomberg are the only english language options. Their view of the world rarely chimes with my experience or understanding of it. Slop did not start with the AI con. That’s an odd one that. Back in 2022 the EU banned RT & Sputnik for “disinformation”- https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/ And yet a 2024 article states that in many EU countries you can still get them. Then again the European parliament wants to ban them from its IT infrastructure as of a few months ago. So maybe a rule more honoured in the breach sort of situation? Indi Samarajiva, at it again. They Corrupt and Call It Peace. Or, they are corrupt and what they deign to offer as peace is rotten. An observation well known in Europe (although not acknowledged by most of the media outlets): “Von der Leyen failed upwards by A) doing corrupt defense deals on her phone and deleting evidence in Germany B) doing corrupt vaccine deals on her phone and deleting evidence for the EU. What mere mortals would consider ruinous scandals are really just a successful job application within White Empire.” What Indi Samarajiva reports has been covered here at Naked Capitalism, but you should read the essay because it is compact, well argued, and spicy indeed. Oreshniks to Belarus — https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1221212/possible-oreshnik-deployment-in-belarus/ Not unexpected, of course. Of the two authors here, back when I was doing journalism I used Lewis as a source and my sense was, while he’d no technical knowledge (degrees in policy and philosophy bs) as long as he was backed up/fronting for a technical person) he was sort of okay. He has a technical person as a co-author here. The British tabloid press is soberly reporting on all this, of course– Russia moves terrifying hypersonic nuclear missiles closer to UK in WW3 terror https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2150812/russia-moves-terrifying-hypersonic-nuclear-missiles TBF, the Daily Express also reported last week that Russian troops were forced to eat each other as they were not being supplied with food. https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2148914/putins-desperate-troops-so-short The Express is probably the worst of the rabid right wing British tabloids. Take whatever they report and how they frame reporting with a bushel of salt rather than a pinch. Pavel Podvig relating to Lewis´s post: Oreshnik in Belarus? There are reasons to be skeptical https://russianforces.substack.com/p/oreshnik-in-belarus Podvig posted the only comment under the Lewis post btw. p.s. However I am not sure any more what to think about Lewis…his proximity to Dems. is odd and out of place. Am always suspecting he downplays or overplays things depending on what may be fitting ideology best. Just like the last paragraph: “(…) impending deployment of Typhon to Germany, and possible future deployments of Dark Eagle (…) Although these systems are purely conventional, Putin has raised the prospect that they could be converted to nuclear-armed systems that could decapitate the Russian leadership in Moscow. This is precisely what he is now doing, by placing Oreshnik in Belarus. (…)” Right! Because Belarus is bordering to Virginia. I didnt´know that. “Why Does the West Hate Russia?” I’m not sure what is to be done here. This hatred goes back at least two centuries and is firmly embedded in the EU countries especially the Baltic States. It is even worse in the UK but mostly in the political elite who are rabid over the subject of Russia. And through emigration, these hatreds have made their may across the Atlantic and has found fertile ground in Washington DC. Victoria Nuland may be an example here. I’m not sure how you dig your way out of this hatred which right now is warping the policies of many western countries to the point that they are destroying their own country in a vague hope of destroying Russia. I don’t know if the Sachs essay that was linked there has been in the NC links but it’s a very good read. I learned a few things, especially about the machinations on German neutrality and eventual rearmament in the 1950s. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/12/24/jeffery-sachs-two-centuries-of-russophobia-rejection-of-peace/ My view of Adenauer is diminished, not that I had any belief that he was a great statesman. It’s too bad that Sachs didn’t get into the Sino-Soviet split, De Gaulle recognizing the PRC, Nixon going to China, etc. I always wonder how much Russophobic treachery was involved in those events. Fascinating stuff. Hate is a strong word. I’d call it a healthy distrust. My ancestors have dealt with several Russian invasions. I do not doubt that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again someday. If the Baltics keep cozying up to the corrupt US and Western Europe and promoting warmongering crazies like Kaja Kallas, you prophecy will no doubt become true. Yes, calling Russians “orcs” and Russia “Mordor” is healthy, humanizing and perfectly normal way to express distrust 🥲 And as Sachs points out, Russia has many reasons for holding a “healthy distrust” of Europe. But I’m curious. When you say you “do not doubt” that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again, on what is this certainty based? The past? Because I have seen no evidence whatsoever of this likelihood after the fall of the Soviet Union, and (as Sachs also points out) much evidence of Russia’s desire for European integration. On the other hand, Russian fears of invasion by the West were reinforced by US/NATO actions almost immediately after the Soviet collapse, and continue to be. I’m not naive. I’m not trying to whitewash past Russian actions, and I understand the effects on historical memory and prejudice. But I honestly cannot see the evidence for such fears of some new Russian imperialist expansion. I am honestly interested in what such evidence might be. Especially since, as I say, there is plenty of reason for Russia to fear the West. “Invade” is a dodgy concept these days. Note that Kaja Kallas included, iirc, 1944 among her “Russian invasions.” I’m not so naive as to believe Russia does not “invade” in general, but they tend to be “defensive” in nature, afaict, such that potential invaders can generally avert by playing diplomacy carefully (see Cold War Finland, and, to a lesser degree, most of the Eastern Bloc–Of course, how much room the countries on the other hand might be quite limited and Russians might not give them too much leash–eg Czechoslovakia in 1968. But such interventions strike me as both more complex than mere “invasions” and not particularly unusual in Great Power-Small Power politics, unpleasant though they might be.) In the real world, attitudes toward Russia differ wildly across Eastern Europe. Usually, but not always, this follows the Orthodox/Western Christianity line of demarcation, but for instance in Slovakia national identity is historically bound up with pan-Slavism and hence Russia. “Eastern Europeans all hate and fear Russia” is just propaganda. Usually the people who say this are from the Baltics, Romania, or Western Ukraine, where it is coupled with an idea that “we are defending Europe from the Asians,” which I suspect (I 100% know in the case of WU) is linked to their past as allies of Germany in WW2. Ally of Germany carries a lot of water for a Romanian. The first to snatch a piece from the territory of Greater Romania was Germany, to pay upfront Hungary as a future ally. Then it allowed USSR to take Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. Romania joined Germany in order to recover those territories lost because of Germany. And then it changed sides and regained Northern Transylvania… With allies like Germany… n=1 but….A very good friend, Polish, opened Dun & Bradstreet’s office in Moscow in 1994. She got on swimmingly with the Russians. But she was not a typical Pole. Among other things, her family harbored Jews during WWII. Russia is the biggest part of Eastern Europe (and used to be much bigger), so your prophecy is true by default. As a matter of fact they are invading Eastern Europe as we speak. Nostradamus stuff indeed. Also. it’s funny that you fail to give any deatils of your ancestors, and their dealings with all those unprovoked full-scale invasions. Reminds me of a recently erect memorial in Canada, that had to blank the names of the “victims”. My Lithuanian ancestors invaded Russia and occupied some of it for almost 2 centuries. I have no doubt the Balts, Poles, Germans along with their western European allies aspire to control Russia again. My deceased elders and Lithuanian relatives HATE Russia and Russians; nothing healthy about that. They have a KKK and Nazi mentality. This goes back to the schism. In Bulgaria (Eastern Orthodox) there is a distinct subset of people with Russia Derangement Syndrome that borders on clinical pathology. There’s no informed argument to be had with them, everyone who exhibits even a mild doubt as to the immaculate blamelessness of the West for the war is automatically labeled a Putinist. Which is kind of funny, considering that they bring up historical grievances going even further back in history than Putin. That is kind of odd, given that it was largely the Russian army that created the independent (in practice, at least) Bulgaria. Well, their answer for that is that Russia didn’t do it out of pure altruism. Which is at least partly the case, but these are creatures wedded to moral absolutism towards others, if only rarely willing to acknowledge their own failings in the morality department. People seem to forget – social networks – especial the haves at a given moment in time “that perceive” a loss of status – ???? [waves@Ayn Rand sorts] – be it power too shape reality or material wealth … don’t go poof when one age cohort expires … its passed down as environmental bias e.g. this whole world is full of peoples[tm] that at one time were BSD and then poof … I think Toynbee was correct about the basic 3 levels of any society. In saying that I had some fun with my Samsung TV a few years ago as it had a Samsung channel that depicted early European/Asia&Minor history. Used to speed it up and the contracts made and broken between ruling classes was Epic … so much cannon fodder … Yes, partly it’s the perceived loss of status by the “landed gentry” (given Ottoman rule, they became landed and propertied by way of scammery, thievery and thuggery after independence, often legitimizing their gains by supporting the anti-Russian governments after Reunification). It’s little wonder that that the most vociferous russophobia one encounters is from members of the so-called “restitute class”, whose restored properties in choice locations in and around Sofia make them a genuine rentier class exuding a sense of superiority that’s backed by little else other than having inherited said properties. Oh, yeah, Russians invaded Bulgaria in 1877, who can forget that unprovoked invasion… It’s a bit more complicated than that, going back to revolutionary activities prior to the war and some less than helpful Russian imperial meddling in the revolutionary organizing. That’s what empires do, but these fine “history truthers” conveniently turn blind eye to anti-Bulgarian German, Austrian, British and French meddling at that period, as it would force them to enter the realm of Realism. They prefer to inhabit the much more gratifying realm of hypocritical morality posturing on the so-called “European values,” which would be great if they were ever actually applied in practice… Old Sam Huntington and his Clash of Civilizations. The map in the linked page shows that fault line. Huntington really lost marbles with the Clash of Civilizations, IMHO. For the great powers, there is something there, although not quite for the reasons that he thinks. For the lesser powers, he’s completely off–countries like South Korea and Vietnam might belong to the same “civilization” as China, but that actually furthers the ambiguity, not lessens it (Taiwan, which is actually “Chinese” illustrates the problem better, in fact. For that matter, why is Japan of a different “civilization” from China?). The problem with Huntington’s glib thinking is that “civilization” as a political identity is a mushy concept, semi-artificially created and maintained. That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant. (Japanese imperial propaganda in Korea between 1910 and 1945 provide lots of examples that both work, fall flat on their face, and were the former but are officially remembered today as the latter–and these are countries with a lot of historical baggage both positive and negative, notwithstanding Huntington’s ignorance.). It goes a lot deeper than the simpleminded “civilizations.” (Unless you have discovered the Republic and Gunpowder?) “really lost marbles” is putting it midly. Sorry for being not very sophisticated but studying political science is like studying BS. And on top of that his life reads like piling even more of that cluelessness: Brzezinski, National Security Council, Trilateral Commission? The fact that he made this career and is still known sheds no good light on the intellectual culture. At.all. “That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant.” Exactly. I thought this would be self-evident today. But hell was I wrong. It’s been 30 years since I read Huntington and more than 50 since he read me, but I’ll undertake a partial defense. The book came out in the 90s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Fukuyama was ready to declare “game over.” Huntington steps up and says, “No, there will not be a Pax Americana or even a Pax Neoliberal. Instead, the old pattern of rivalries. along the fracture lines of language, religion and culture, will resume. One group that certainly took this seriously are the neocons, who have spent the last 30 years trying to exploit these fissures, especially in the Balkans and the Caucasus, and they’ve been pretty successful at making trouble. I know Huntington had been thinking along these lines since the mid-70s not because I had read anything of his or taken a course from him, but because he turned up as a surprise reader of my senior thesis. The subject matter was how would the arrival of lots of suburban, Republican voters in formerly Dixiecrat rural counties affect the level of political activity and participation, in other words, a mild clash of civilizations. So I think he deserves credit for having a more accurate idea of where we were headed than those who thought the end of the Cold War would end or at least greatly decrease international violence. You may be right that the “civilization” concept is mushy, and that Huntington’s analysis of the Far East is weak, but he sure seems to have gotten a lot of things right as upstater confirms with his assertion that the acrimony between Poland and the Baltics on the the one side and Russia on the other goes back to the Great Schism. Thanks for this account. I don´t want to disregard any scholar´s insight just because I do not concur with the politics behind it. But it frankly appears to me that what you did was analyze after the fact and come to a conclusion. Just what science does. Huntington on the other hand got invovled into creating a situation first which only caused the crisis. And then he was doing scholarly work about that very crisis as if it had already been in place – without any interference and assistance from his own “people” and his own ideas (“inspired” by your work in this example). I am not the expert so please forgive my superficial take: In the Arab world I often understood that, again simplified, radical Islam of the 1980s was the response to the demise of left/Communist/nationalist movements. So latter had to be destroyed first as they withstood Western imperial interests. And only when in the wake of the destruction of civil society the “healthy” fabric disintegrated would former – radical Islam – find the fertile ground and the space to take over (with a lot of help from us.) And eventually after supporting those circles of the US that had been responsible for this shift in the Middle East would Huntington come up and present his “scholarship”. It almost sounds as if he turned things upside down. (I know this is a bit exaggerated. But I hope the essence of my simple point comes across. And I assume that he probably didn´t even realize his hand in all this to some extent.) p.s. Maybe some remember the Danish caricature scandal: 20 years ago Jyllands-Posten published provocative caricatures about Muhammad. Expecting outrage. However initially there was no such reaction by the Muslim communities at all. So the editors actually sent the pictures to Muslim communities explicitly. But those again responded very relaxed and stated it didn´t really bother them. Only after these disappointing reactions did the paper force it and other papers took it up, I believe French outlets in particular. I don´t exactly remember the chronology then but I do know that almost nobody was interested in how this affair had actually started. So what happened the paper had created a scandal to sell its product. Plain and simple. And then swapped cause and effect. Oh, and nonetheless this once huge scandal has been completely forgotten. I do not believe that people hate. And elites work really really hard to bring about this hatred. And people like Huntington are part of that. In whatever twisted ways. But classic, clear-minded, honest scholarship – IMHO – never gets invovled with the politcs of the subjects it researches. Sorry for the length. I think the problem with Huntington was that he was purporting to write about the future of international order, not internal dynamics of politics within great powers. If his argument were only that great powers would seek to orient themselves around a common sense of shared civilization, that would be correct to a large degree, but that was not his primary claim. This, incidentally, is a very old critique of Huntington–that nations do not have allegiance towards allegedly shared civilizations. It came out almost as soon as the Huntington essay came out in Foreign Affairs (that was a long while before the book, I think.). Neighboring countries often share civilizations. They also have more shared interests and conflicts. These trump whatever civilizational affinity there is. They would rather align with “alien” civilization against their neighbor, or, at least, hedge their bets, which create seemingly “counter civilizational” motives. The Lithuanians I actually know express opinions on the full range as regards our neighbor-to-the-west-and-east. Not ten years ago, we were the only of the three Baltics not to have an organic anti-russian movement of any significance whatsoever. The intervening decade of influence operations against us is starting to show results, sadly. Latvians and Estonians are indeed kind of psychos. Locally, and in our drinks, it is theorized the same might have become of us if we had also allowed ourselves to be colonized and ruled by the Crusader orders. That kind of influence has to leave a mark. But “Baltics” is (weirdly) an overbroad category… The “Lithuanians” cultivated for decades in the US, UK, and Canada as weapons against Teh Commiez, on the other hand? Nazis to the core. I do remember that there were Lavian and Estonian volunteer SS divisions, but not a Lithuanian one (heck, Estonia probably raised more SS troops per capita than any other country…) Russian invasions? Most likely the arc of Russian invasions, in an active way, moved mostly east and south. In the west was in fact a scramble between empires. I.e. Bulgarians, Romanians cannot claim of being invaded by Russians, when the fights were just on their territories btw Russians and Ottomans or Austrians, Swedes, etc… There’s a pretty fundamental difference between invasion and liberation. FWIW, growing up in the U.S. during the Cold War, I and most people I met didn’t hate the Russians/Soviets. The usual take was “They’re good people with a bad government”. When later I met some people from the Soviet Union, that was their take on the U.S. This may have just been naive why-can’t-we-all-get-along-ism but I never encountered the kind of poisonous hatred other commenters are describing. The dehumanizing rhetoric in Europe must be witnessed to be believed. What we in the US would call ‘hate speech’ is fully normalized with respect to Russia and Russians, especially in former Axis allies. It was funny when my Dad who grew up in Hungary met a US Vietnam Veteran Dad, in the US. I had to translate but both had been raised with stories about how evil the other army had been. Fun memory: “thwarting Cold War fairy-tales with a lot of beer.” Dad found it really odd that you weren´t allowed to buy booze on Sundays in the bible belt. So the first time he went to the cashier and filled the cart with the finest bottles you can imagine. Until he was denied the purchase. I had to interfere and calm him down since he caused a ruckus and cursing – fortunately – in Hungarian. Which is quite bad. But few understand it. Travelled from one end of Russia to the other in the late 90s. Folks were always friendly to Americans. “You’ve never killed us.” Many of my companions were Germans and on rare occasions bitterness toward Germany from the 1940s did come up. Just absorbing what one does in general media and education, I always thought of Lithuania as one of the three Baltic tinies. I was surprised to find out that it is a former great power. Re. “Both of these influencers…” The “precious metals” sphere has had the emergence of an AI oriental looking “presenter” giving a series of very slick programs highlighting the “doomed” nature of the metals markets as presently constituted. On the “original” metals vlogs this “character” is jokingly referred to as AI Man, and yet the information “he” presents is seriously debated. The ultimate agenda of whoever is behind AI Man is still murky at best. This highlights what is possibly the greatest danger from this AI People phenomenon, the very effective value of well made AI programing as propaganda. When everybody accepts “unreality” as the new normal… I am now waiting for the emergence of AI Politicos. We call Politicos ‘fakes’ already. What’s to stop the power elites from taking that idea to its logical extreme? Stay safe. Practice your pattern recognition skills. God forbid that this does not eventually lead to a whole bunch of AI Ben Shapiros, each tailor made to a specific audience but combined creating a political movement. My initial defense to this is to stick to Youtube channels I know. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the feed is filling up with these AI fakes. The other day, I made the mistake of clicking on what I thought was Mercouris. After a minute or so, I knew it wasn’t Alexander because there was no nose-picking and no stuttering. I’ve seen fake Wilkersons, MacGregors and lots of Mearsheimers. Usually, these fakes are making outrageous claims, discrediting these commentators to people who aren’t cautious. Crazy world. We’re getting to the point where your assumption has to be any channel created after 2026-01-01 has a >50% chance of being fake or some form of astroturf. The fake-AI Bob Barker insult comedy videos make me laugh though, lmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPitD1eYLiM Having the same experiences that you have had. It’s bad enough when YouTube keeps on shoving adds into those videos and you can see that the “presenter” is actually an AI. Hint – it’s hard for a human to talk and have a big smile on their face at the same time but that is how you pick an AI person. Best to stick to their official channels I guess. It seems that the real Mercouris, MacGregor, and Mearsheimer could file complaints with YouTube and report these channels. And per YT policy they should be taken down, just like YT took down channels spreading COVID “misinformation.” I won’t hold my breath, though. Especially because all of the real McCoys are engaged in truth telling that inconveniences the narrative that narrative makers want us to buy. Perhaps this is a deliberate move from the narrative makers to discredit alt-media and make it more difficult for them to get their message out. For one thing, it could easily affect traffic and revenue. Surely these commentators are aware this is happening. I’d like to hear them address how they’re trying to deal with this and the extent to which Youtube is cooperating. Mercouris has talked about doing that fair bit, but it seems that YT has not been as responsive as he’d have liked. (Although fake Mercouris seems rarer than others) I actively report such channels – at this point easy to spot, and block them from my feed. Hopefully if a large number of viewers do so, also, they will disappear (for the time being). We had friends and neighbors over for dinner during the Holidays. One of these families has a 22 year old young man who is quite frankly movie star handsome and is very bright. There were other kids his age here at the same time. It came up in conversation that ANY and ALL texts, emails, etc he receives with any possible dating partner are sent through AI services to a) have a full profile of the possible partner’s mental health and motivations and b) to assess their compatibility with him. Again, in my day, this would not have been a young man who would have had any problems attracting women and furthermore all of the above issues he is sending to AI would have been talked out with his closest friends. Now we ditch the friends, the locker rooms, the bar, the basketball court and hand everything over to Grok or chat GPT. What really concerned me is that every person in my house between 18-30 or so that evening informed us all that they do exactly the same thing. AI screening of all potential dates, partners, etc. This was new to me and I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. We are removing humanity from every single interaction we have. I fear for these kids when they are 50. But the other very concerning issue is that all texts, emails, any correspondence at all that has our individual names, email addresses, phone numbers, whatever are being sent to AI companies to be analyzed. And we have zero idea this is even being done. You can avoid it all you want in your life, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI has no intention at all of avoiding you. Please, anyone, help me find a bright spot here. Do you think this is a truly representative experience for the US or rather fringe? Bright spot? Not bright: But maybe things happening later in their lives which will render this new way of connecting less attractive. Life has a way of messing things up, doesn´t it? As they say in German: “Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt”/”Man proposes, God disposes.” (I assume the idea of a “ghost in the machine” too is related to the chaos-oriented hope that not all can be planned and manipulated incessently in an AI-controlled society.) Sometimes you have to dodge people walking down the street who are staring at their phones. Re Doc’s tale presumably any kid who is off the electronic grid never gets a date–the new definition of a wallflower. Filmmaker John Hughes would have made much of this. Ned Ludd would not have been on any social media. The “moderne” habits of social media use are quite understandable if viewed through the lens of conformism as a social organizing strategy. Being in the world but not of it is very hard. I try and generally fail in that endeavour. However, I continue trying. The main point about any of the so called AIs we encounter is that they are simple tools for others. A computer program has no agency. As the Late Lamented Lambert remarked, code is law. Learn who or what lies behind an AI and you are half way to mastering said AI. As for the use of AIs in general; I have noticed that many people are prone to searching out the “easy way” to accomplish difficult tasks. Thinking is hard. It takes will power to ‘buckle down’ and do the hard work when a supposedly “easy” fix is available. I too fear for the younger cohorts. They will eventually encounter problems that AIs cannot fix for them. Then the lack of skills and training will cripple them in the face of their problems. I fear I am becoming trite, but this is nothing really new. The problems of laziness and lack of skill acquisition are perennial. Today, with the “help” of high tech, those problems have become automated, at scale. As the “adults” in the room, so to speak, our task is the difficult one of finding those of the younger cohorts who can be helped and are willing to try. We are now entering a period of Social Triage. Stay safe, strong and resilient. A friend who has a Gen Z co-worker reported the following… Gen Z co-worker wanted to use ChatGPT to resolve a customer issue. Friend: “no, we shouldn’t do that.” Co-worker admitted to probably relying on ChatGT too much, but at least wasn’t as bad as co-worker’s partner, who evidently wears ear buds and has an AI app listen to all conversations with other humans. In conversation with others, this person just waits, listens to the earbuds to be told what to say by the AI, and then responds. So…. You ready to do a Butlerian Jihad now, Doc? 😉 3 tomahawks failed to explode out of 12? That’s pretty bad pic.twitter.com/OivQCQ70DD — Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) December 27, 2025 Who’s cleaning the mess up? Are those only going to lay there to be photographed? And another speculation crossed my mind that may be wild to mention. Those two lying on flat ground have been put there gently, so someone is already doing some cleaning. I don’t what is worse: Lord Bebo passing off AI slop as real or people on this site falling for it. We were overdue for a feral hog story. Excellent timing! For a shorter summary of the Epstein history, see the Doug Ross item. Thank you for the link which I have bookmarked. I am three hours through the four hour Mike Benz broadcast that was in today’s links. Except for an explanation of Epstein’s entre into Bear Stearns, that link can be skipped up to about the 50 minute part (Yadda-yadda). As this outline suggests, Benz highlights many points at which Epstein’s life intersects with some very interesting characters involved in some very significant “deep history” events. At minimum he provides reasons to take the Epstein case seriously rather than write it off as simply the sensationalized actions of a “lone pervert” or (as with the NY Times) just a con-man ripping off poor unsuspecting billionaires. A lot of this is being covered in the on-going work of Ryan Grim and Drop Site News. And almost all of it has been covered earlier by Whitney Webb, who continues to be ignored by the mainstream press but also gets shafted by a lot of the alt media. I’ve been very cautious about Benz. He was a sketchy anonymous right-wing “influencer” before he suddenly exploded all over the internet as a former State Department employee and supposed intelligence expert. But much of what he says does ring true and correspond with other sources. That link is great. Also confirms my priors. I had long thought and sometimes said that Epstein was most likely an arms dealer. That is hugely lucrative. Looks like he was broadly involved in that nexus. On the name change to the Trump-Kennedy Center, it’s worth noting that the original name is The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center. A “Memorial” refers to how a society honors someone who is already dead. I doubt Trump realizes adding his name makes no sense. Second, Trump is not adding his name or building monuments to himself because he has a big ego. Rather, he knows deep down how incompetent and weak he truly is. And he spends enormous energy hiding that fact. For this reason, he realizes that when he dies nobody is going to build anything in honor to him. Or he’s just messing with people. It used to be hard to guess which part of Trump was shtick. Nowadays he seems genuinely gaga. A headstone?

Becoming a billionaire rarely involves doing what’s right. Forgive me for asking again but what are the best alternatives for using YT? I have no YT account but some channels like Pascal Lottaz are only on YT and sometimes I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. So I stopped watching. There were ad-free YT-alternatives but those disappeared and the most recent comments about the existing YT alternatives mentioned on NC recently I forgot to bookmark. I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. A wireless mouse could be one solution? I download everything I want to watch. Then watch at my own leisure, including fast forwarding and rewinding. No ads. Works on 90% of stuff out there. Then, delete to free the disk space. How do you download things? I had WonderShare for years but the algorithm changes and now I need to upgrade. Which I haven’t been able to do. media-downloader https://github.com/mhogomchungu/media-downloader I use Any Video Converter Ultimate. Free download. You just have to get a slightly older version, some 2-3 years old. Works with w10 and w11. Video Download Helper extension on Firefox works well but those more savvy than me can discuss whether the permissions make it a spybot. Firefox does offer tracking protections that may block. I never use Chrome or Safari. If you want to watch YouTube on your phone, I have heard good things about Newpipe, though I haven’t tried it myself yet. If you want an alternative site, some youtubers cross-post to Rumble, so depending on what channels you want to watch, they may already be there. Rumble is newer, so not as enshittifide yet. I use Newpipe on Android with excellent results. No ads. Download features available On desktop I use Firefox browser with the YouTube ad block extension. Also works excellently. Can’t download, but no ads. It also works with a YT account without issues. Both the above work without a YT account. If i am understanding the problem correctly. You can use the FireFox browser to watch programs like “Neutrality Studies” ad free once you install an ad blocker like “ublock Orgin” . Setting -> Extentions and Themes Then search ublock under addons Brave browser blocks utube ads by default and allows background play on android. I’m a hard-core IT nerd so I use a technique not available to most: I use the ‘yt-dlp’ program to download videos, mostly from video-game playthroughs, and watch those on a flash drive plugged into my TV. I also download long music videos for video game soundtracks, turn those into MP3 files, and play them on my phone. As part of the soundtrack project I use a program that I wrote 30 years ago and made open-source. So… not a normal responder. Youtube has lately been playing ‘arms race’ with the downloader apps, and I don’t know if they still work. Cheers, and good luck! As a medium-hardness-core IT nerd, I use 9xbuddy.com, savefrom.net, and invidio.us. The first one works on bunch of sites. FreeTube app. All ads defeated. Excellent. Thanks for the help to everyone!!! I guess I figure out the best solution. And I will bookmark this now. I don’t have a YT account so I do not understand your issue. And I watch a LOT of YT. If you use the Orion browser, it blocks YT ads. But sometime the video freezes as a result of the ad blocking and you have to restart (but it will resume where it stopped). I had a lot of ads during shows like Neutrality Studies. Every 3-5 minutes. It became impossible to listen to especially when I am not near the computer to click it away. But Lottaz is an important source. As is Patrik Baab. And several others. So I try to solve it. Pardon selling……Does no one remember Marc Rich? https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bill-clintons-last-outrage-the-presidents-defenders-feel-betrayed-by-his-pardon-of-marc-rich/ The Dhammacetiya Buddhist group is having their Walk for Peace from Fort Worth Texas to Washington DC. The group of monks has recently entered LaGrange, Georgia. Their website has a daily map, and their Facebook page has a live map. Local news stations along the path have had stories of the monks. “Photos show California slammed with heavy rain, mudslides from storm” Between the floods, the fires and the earthquakes, you sometimes wonder if California hates people and is trying to kill them off. Nah, since half the state doesn’t have seasons, earthquakes, fires, floods, and riots become our seasons. Apropos of nothing this is interesting. https://www.openculture.com/2025/12/what-pompeii-looked-like-hours-before-its-destruction-a-reconstruction.html The Pompeii/Herculaneum archaeology have been really useful because the high-class Romans who wrote all of the scrolls did not care about how everyday life worked. For example, they dug up a two-story-high wooden wheel that they used to do construction work. We had no idea! Also, the wine shops had murals that look exactly like 1970s Napa wine country graphic design. I grew up in Northern California in the 70s, marinated in that stuff. re: In 2026, Will Americans Finally Turn Against Oligarchs? -Matt Stoller Thanks for the link. A must read, imo. Lol the so called left would never even consider withholding voters It began when Cuban American lawmakers pressed Mr. Trump early this year to end Chevron’s Biden-era confidential license. After Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio announced in late February that they would do so, Mr. Maduro stopped accepting deportation flights of Venezuelans. Mr. Maduro had agreed to them on Jan. 31 with Richard Grenell, a special envoy for Mr. Trump. Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, lobbied the administration for a license extension, speaking to Mr. Trump several times over the coming months. The Cuban American lawmakers got wind that the license could be extended, and they threatened to withhold their votes for Mr. Trump’s signature legislation, “the One Big Beautiful Bill.” At the Oval Office meeting in late May, Mr. Trump told Mr. Rubio and Mr. Miller that he needed to get the bill passed. But he said he had heard about the downsides of ending the license, including that Chinese companies would take over Chevron’s stakes, said an official. The president demanded options. That was when Mr. Miller offered to help. He had been nurturing his ideas for mass deportations and boat strikes. Mr. Trump did not renew Chevron’s license when it expired on May 27. His domestic policy bill passed Congress five weeks later. https://archive.ph/pnWpI How Oil, Drugs and Immigration Fueled Trump’s Venezuela Campaign re: Zionism as cult 10 min. with Katie Halper and Russell Dobular https://scheerpost.com/2025/12/27/zionism-scientology-and-the-cult-mentality-no-one-talks-about/ This story from the London Times, Sunday edition in 2023 sheds some new light for me on what’s happened to the UK Labour Party and the rise of Starmer.

Many companies may cut jobs in 2026 as they use more artificial intelligence. A new survey shows big firms are planning layoffs, especially in marketing roles. Unemployment is already high, and hiring is slowing. Some CEOs warn workers to learn AI skills, while others say AI will mostly change tasks, not replace jobs.

Title: A 'jobless boom' is shaping up to be the story of the 2026 economy

The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs. Hot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a "Great Freeze." As KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, "Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled." It's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a "jobless boom." Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you. Instead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and "do more with less" has been the mantra of the year. "Firms are doing more with fewer workers," Swonk wrote. "Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels more in line with demand. Others are offsetting the squeeze on profit margins due to tariffs with layoffs and hiring freezes." Economists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts. Business Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt "impossible," and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life. In addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread. This suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty. The tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow. Dozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job. In his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for "ROI for AI." "I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects," he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year. If that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market. Although it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the "Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead." Still, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains. Jump to

Title: India Inc 2026: Hinterland hiring, gig growth and AI disruption

Dear reader, as 2025, a year of global tumult and volatility, rolls by, Mint's reporters and columnists look around the corner on what is coming in 2026—to help you know what to expect and prepare for it. Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com. The Chinese zodiac predicts that 2026 will be the Year of the Fire Horse, symbolizing bold decisions, ambition and sharply moving away from the strategic thinking that was 2025, the Year of the Wood Snake. For both the employer and the employee in India Inc, there will be three prominent trends, says experts. The spotlight will shift to smaller cities and towns as companies look for the right talent and metros lose their lure. The second change will be the dominant role that the gig workforce will play. Thirdly, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) will remain an integral aspect of the workplace in the coming year with concerns on how to upskill employees without letting go of the high performers. About 18 months ago, recruitment firm CIEL HR opened a hiring hub in Patna where 25 recruiters scout for talent from neighbouring Chhattisgarh and Odisha states and the smaller towns of Bihar. The aim was to cater to the hiring needs of retail, financial services, consumer goods, and manufacturing clients. A similar hub was created earlier in Mysuru in Karnataka as well to tap into IT talent. “The demand from smaller towns will grow because the total cost of hiring and retaining an employee is 5-10% lower in the longer run for companies as those who migrate can be held onto for a longer period than those who are from the larger metros with their offices and homes in the same city,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, managing director and chief executive officer of CIEL HR. The total cost of hiring denotes the overall financial implications of an employee during one's tenure. In this case, it will include investments in upskilling the employee and how their productivity impacts the firm. Mishra pointed out that companies have started employing a blended workforce where a major chunk will be from the same city, 20-25% from nearby towns and the rest from other states. This is largely in the case of temporary staffing, where the employee works at the client's site but will be on the payrolls of the vendor. Over the past couple of years, staffing firms found it difficult to get workers for the peak sale period (August-December) as the workforce demanded higher wages for relocation to the larger cities. A similar challenge will continue in the coming year. Cost pressures on companies will force more gig hiring across the skillset spectrum. Until now, the spurt in gig hiring would come on the back of festive season recruitment, but with the implementation of the labour codes, the benefits for gig workers are cemented. Online food delivery, e-commerce and quick-commerce companies will now have to allocate up to 2% of their annual turnover for the welfare of gig and platform workers. In November, the ministry of labour and employment announced that with the new reforms, all workers would get benefits such as retirement savings via provident fund, coverage under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, other insurance and social security benefits. Therefore, there will be a larger number of the informal workforce aiming to enter the gig economy. While on a vendor's payroll, gig workers take up short-term projects that could be for a few hours or days and they can work across platforms. Dark stores, retail and logistics are some of the segments that hire gig workers on a large scale. The country’s gig workforce is projected to grow from 10 million in 2024-25 to 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to a Press Information Bureau note on 30 August. "Gig will continue to grow in scale as more people will be eager to join this workforce after new labour codes giving them the social security cover along with blue collar and even white-collar gig roles will scale up," said Lohit Bhatia, CEO-designate for Quess Corp. Blue-collared workers are typically employed in the automotive and manufacturing sector while white-collared find a job in services. In 2025, companies including Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta retrenched employees, citing AI. Companies are in a flux as they scamper to upskill employees on the latest in technology. They are hiring candidates who have the prowess on AI and at the same time, letting go of those who are in the bottom rung of the skillsets. There is a stress that has built up across industries and will play out in the coming year as well. "I do not expect AI’s impact on workplaces to stabilize or 'calm down' after the layoffs we saw in 2025. The 2025 layoffs were not only about cost-cutting – they were about restructuring work around AI systems. In 2026, in my view, that process will deepen," said Rohini Lakshane, a technologist and researcher. Lakshane said companies will have to take note of how they inform and discuss with their workforce the changes in profiles because of AI. “Jobs will not vanish in waves, but they will be hollowed out, with fewer people doing more work, assisted and monitored by AI. Tasks within roles will be automated, recombined or shifted. If that is done without clear communication to workers, it creates insecurity even when employment technically continues," Lakshane said. With increased automation, the pressure on employees will go up as well. "Workers who can design, audit or manage AI systems will remain in demand. For highly skilled professionals, especially in technology and analytics, 2026 will look calmer on the surface, but expectations might rise sharply. Fewer people doing more work, assisted by AI tools, with thinner margins for error," said Lakshane. Ironically, India Inc is one of the swiftest to adopt AI in its teams. According to an EY report covering 50 employers and 800 employees, about 62% use GenAI at work regularly, whereas 90% of the employers and 86% of the employees believe that AI impacts productivity positively. The study noted that 75% of the employees and 72% of the employers believe that GenAI enhances decision making, 82% of the employees and 92% of the employers believe it positively impacts the quality of work.
