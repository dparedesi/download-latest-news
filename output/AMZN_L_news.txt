Title: Trade deficits happen for good reasons — not only from unfair practices
URL: https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2025/04/05/trade-deficits-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-05T18:29:08Z

On April 2, the Trump administration announced a system of tariffs on imports into the United States. The executive order imposed 10% tariffs for imports from all countries (excluding Canada and Mexico, which remain subject to tariffs imposed over the last two months) which take effect April 5, with higher tariffs for countries with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficit, to begin April 9. This means that imports from the European Union will be tariffed at 20%, while imports from China will see tariffs of 34% (see here for the full list of tariff rates.) In the short run, these tariffs will lead to increased prices, particularly for household products, cars, construction materials and some food items. As an example, the U.S. imports the bulk of its jasmine rice from Thailand which will have a reciprocal tariff of 36%. The extent to which the 36% tariff will be borne by rice farmers in Thailand, importers, grocery stores or households depends on the relative price sensitivity of each of these groups, but economic consensus is that households will bear at least part of that cost through higher prices. Items from toothbrushes to cars to washing machines will be similarly affected. Changes in the relative price of some goods and an increase in economic uncertainty around the profitability of some lines of business will lead to changes in investment decisions by companies in the United States. Retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart will see margins tightened and will have decreased incentive to open new stores or expand existing retail locations. Auto manufacturers will delay production as they seek to understand the impact on their business from the changes in tariffs. One early example is Stellantis, the manufacturer of American auto brands Chrysler and Jeep, who announced on April 3 that it will pause production on some auto lines leading to temporary layoffs for 900 hourly U.S. workers. Delays in production and investment are likely to continue as uncertainty about the way that these policies will alter the U.S. economy are digested. These reductions in investment and production delays increase the near-term likelihood of a recession. If tariffs persist, they will change the composition of the U.S. economy. Tariffs increase the prices at which domestic producers of tariffed products can sell their goods. This increases potential profits in protected industries, leading to higher prices and often lower quality for manufactured goods. It also leads to shifts in the nature of goods produced in the economy. Previously profitable sectors of the economy will see decreased demand as prices rise which will lead to layoffs and a short-term increase in unemployment. If the tariffs continue, jobs will eventually migrate to more tariff-protected segments of the economy. This will lead to overall declines in growth however, as these tariff-protected regions of the economy grow because of the increased profits associated with tariffs as opposed to increases in the demand for their products. The executive order issued this week gives justification for the imposition of tariffs as “... a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption ...” However, the tariff rate imposed on our foreign trade partners seems to be proportional to the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with that country divided by the total dollar value of goods imported from that country, with a minimum rate of 10%. As such, the policy enshrines the idea that if there is a trade deficit, it is because of unfair trade policies on the part of foreign counterparties. Yet this is largely not consistent with the nature of trade. Just as most households run a trade deficit with the grocery store (“importing” goods from the store in exchange for money), we choose to import goods from abroad because they can be produced more efficiently there and we would rather use our productive capacity to produce higher-margin goods and services. We do not produce significant amounts of jasmine rice in the U.S. because doing so would be expensive for us and we would rather use our land and labor to produce goods and services that allow us to profit from our unique productive abilities. Complicating the role of tariffs is the reality that one cannot decouple foreign demand for American-produced goods, which reduces the trade deficit, from foreign demand for American assets, which increases it. When a U.S. distributor of luxury Swiss watches pays $5 million for a shipment of timepieces, the Swiss manufacturer of those timepieces can choose what to do with that $5 million. They can use those dollars to purchase American-made goods, or they can use that money to purchase American assets like real estate, stocks, bonds or Treasury securities. If they choose to purchase assets, then there is an increase in the trade deficit, which measures differences in the value of the shipment of goods (as opposed to assets) across borders. As such, the size of the trade imbalance with a country is inextricably linked to the relative desirability of American assets. The attractiveness in recent decades of American assets, and foreigners’ willingness to purchase them, is an important driver of our trade balance. This foreign investment in the U.S. because of the desirability of American assets has allowed U.S. companies to hire additional workers, produce additional products, and offer dividends that would not otherwise have been possible. A cooling of trade between countries as a result of tariffs will reduce this source of capital. One open question is whether the tariff announcement this week represents a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy that will persist throughout President Trump’s term in office, or whether it is the opening offer in bilateral trade negotiations to be had with our trading partners over the coming weeks, as has happened with Canada and Mexico since Trump’s inauguration in January. Retaliatory tariffs from across the world is also a high likelihood. Either way, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of policy in recent months and the questions that remain about the current proposal run the real risk of decreasing short-term investment and hiring by American companies and the desirability of American assets to foreigners. These risks have increased the likelihood of both inflation and decreased growth in the near term.

Title: Why Big Tech Interviews Take So Long. Here’s How To Beat The Process
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylrobinson/2025/04/05/why-big-tech-interviews-take-so-long-heres-how-to-beat-the-process/

ByCheryl Robinson ByCheryl Robinson, Contributor. Long interview processes at major tech companies are leaving job seekers waiting weeks for a ... More response. If you’ve ever felt like the interview process at a major tech company drags on forever, you’re not imagining things. A new study from Career.io confirms what many job seekers have suspected: landing a role at a top tech firm often means surviving a long, winding hiring process with the worst offenders keeping you waiting for nearly a month. The study analyzed publicly available data from 14 major U.S. tech companies, ranking them based on how long it typically takes to move from interview to job offer. The results? Some of the biggest names in the business aren’t just giants in innovation—they’re giants in hiring delays, too. At Oracle, candidates often wait close to four weeks for a response—if they receive one at all. According to reviews on Glassdoor, some candidates said their interview process lasted up to two months. Apple isn’t far behind, with an average turnaround time of 22 days. Adobe and Salesforce also require candidates to buckle up for a wait exceeding three weeks. While hiring managers may aim for the perfect fit, they inadvertently drive top talent away. Studies show that 82% of candidates lose interest in a role if the interview process drags on too long. This growing phenomenon, known as interview fatigue, occurs when job seekers become mentally and emotionally exhausted from drawn-out hiring procedures, repetitive interview rounds and unclear timelines. According to insights from Titus Talent, companies risk losing strong candidates not because of poor fit but because of poor processes. Amanda Augustine, a certified career coach at Career.io, says there’s a reason hiring has become more prolonged in recent years. “The tech industry has intensified the interview process, largely due to heightened competition stemming from layoffs,” she explains. “Hiring managers in big tech now hold more leverage than ever, implementing more rigorous and lengthy interview processes to identify the ‘best fit’ among a broader pool of applicants.” That means multiple interview rounds, technical assessments, culture-fit evaluations and follow-up conversations—all before a decision is made. Not every tech company is stuck in the slow lane. According to the report, Uber has the fastest hiring process, averaging just 9.34 days from interview to offer. Amazon (10.11 days) and Netflix (14.23 days) follow close behind. There’s a reason for this efficiency: Uber and Amazon rely heavily on high-turnover frontline workers like drivers and warehouse staff, necessitating a streamlined process. But it’s not just about speed for the sake of speed. Netflix, for example, emphasizes cultural alignment during their process, with multiple interviews and a final “vibe check” to ensure a strong team fit. Augustine notes, “Both Uber and Amazon have a reputation for hiring with flexibility in their workforce. The speed of drivers’ and warehouse workers’ onboarding has resulted in an expedited interview process, highlighting the operational priorities within the tech sector.” Interview fatigue is rising as candidates endure multiple rounds and extended timelines in today’s ... More competitive job market. Lengthy interviews aren’t going away anytime soon, but job seekers can approach them more strategically. Augustine recommends three ways to manage the marathon process: Interviewing at big tech firms may require patience, resilience, and a plan B. But with the right mindset and a few smart moves, candidates can stay in control—even when the process drags on.

Title: Should We Talk About The Weather? Should We Talk About The Government?
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/should-we-talk-about-the-weather
Time Published: 2025-04-04T16:31:27Z
Full Content:
Severe storms this week have caused tornadoes, high winds, and flooding across large parts of the country since Wednesday, killing a least seven people so far, with more storms expected in the Midwest and Southeast in the next few days. The wave of storms comes as the National Weather Service (NWS) is coping with huge job losses thanks to Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s war on government agencies, especially the ones that deal with climate change, which Trumpers consider a made-up “religious” belief that can be safely ignored. The current storms follow another heavy storm system in March that killed at least 39 in tornadoes, high winds, and wildfires. The weather service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has lost at least 2,000 workers between firings, layoffs of “provisional” employees, and people taking/being pushed to take buyouts, leading to about 20 percent fewer staff dealing with the same amount of weather, which the administration has been unable to cut. In addition to the staff cuts, NOAA will shut down a number of its research division’s websites because its contracts with web services providers have been cancelled, according to Bloomberg News (gift link). As a result, almost all external websites reliant on Amazon, Google and WordPress services are poised to vanish early Saturday morning in Washington, wiping the bulk of the unit’s work, which includes climate and environmental science research, from public view. Sure, that sounds bad, but you probably didn’t visit those sites anyway, so you won’t even notice they’re gone. You’d certainly notice if Wonkette were gone, so we need you to become a paid subscriber if you can! If you already are, you rock! Scientists have been warning that the mass firings will harm weather forecasting and endanger the public, especially as hurricane season approaches. Of course, it’s extremely difficult to prove any links between the staff cuts and potential loss of life due to extreme weather, which kills people no matter how good the forecasts are. But any loss of lead time in warning the public, especially in the case of tornadoes, will make it harder for people to take shelter. Already this week, the National Weather Service office in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that because of staffing shortages, it wouldn’t be able to send teams out to survey the damage from tornadoes that hit the area Wednesday, at least not until after currently forecast storms have cleared, probably near the end of this weekend. In the meantime, the office asked members of the public to send the office photos of storm damage. NWS Louisville meteorologist Brian Neudorff explained that such crowdsourced photos would help the office “evaluate the damage and it will allow us to plan on where we need to go once we have the available staff to survey.” Local TV station WAVE also very responsibly reported that the Weather Service announcement didn’t directly link the staffing issues to the mass shitcannings at NOAA, instead leaving the audience to put two and two together. The staffing cuts have also forced multiple NWS locations to cut weather balloon launches from twice daily to just one a day. Some locations will halt balloon launches altogether, presumably because some other launch site is close enough for diminished government work. Not huge cuts — yet — just reductions or suspensions of balloon launches at 11 sites so far, a tenth of those that had been in use. The NWS uses these weather balloons, until recently launched twice per day from 100 total locations, to gather temperature, wind, pressure and other data from the ground up to approximately 100,000 feet. The results are compiled along with data from satellites, radar stations, surface weather stations, buoys and aircraft to build weather models and forecasts that are public and freely available. Former NOAA weather data boffin Michael Morgan, now an atmospheric science professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the reduced data may not be critical just yet, but it will make a difference to forecasts’ overall accuracy and timeliness: “We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” Morgan said in a press conference Monday. “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast. “Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.” Alan Sealls, the president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, offered a more striking metaphor, comparing losing some weather balloon data to knocking a few bolts here and there out of the steel frame for an office tower: “Nobody can say how many bolts you can leave out or remove before the structural integrity is compromised.” We hasten to point out that this is indeed just a metaphor, and not an accusation that weather balloons did 9/11. The tragic thing here is that improvements in weather forecasting have led to significantly fewer deaths from extreme weather in the US and around the world. That’s primarily because forecasters have been able to give the public greater lead time in warning of conditions that will spawn tornadoes, as well as more accurate forecasts of the track of hurricanes, interventions by presidential Sharpie notwithstanding. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told CNN the staffing cuts will definitely lead to a decline in reliability of forecasts: “Any reduction in staffing at a weather forecast office will result in either delays in the forecast being issued, and watches and warnings as well, or an erosion of quality. […] It wouldn’t surprise me at all if at the end of the season we’ve gone back by a few years – maybe a decade – in terms of capability.” Spinrad led NOAA during the Biden administration, however, so we’re certain that the seasoned science experts on Twitter will explain that forecasts were good enough a decade ago, and that government scientists have only themselves to blame for losing their jobs because they kept saying climate change was real, even though that’s now illegal, and besides, now that Florida is preparing to outlaw “weather manipulation,” the number of deadly storms will definitely go down, so there. Yes, kids, we’re now going to enter a new age of stupid online arguments. It’ll be a bit like climate change. We know a warmer atmosphere is causing more extreme weather events, but it remains hard to attribute any particular storm’s effects to a warming climate. In some cases, like the heavier rainfall, greater storm surge, and rapid increase in severity of hurricanes in recent years, the connections are quite clear: Warmer air can hold far more moisture, warmer water expands, and higher ocean temperatures provide hurricanes a lot more energy to grow quickly. But tornadoes are such short-lived events, dependent on lots of variables, that the exact connections are still difficult to determine. Similarly, as Spinrad and others make clear, staffing cuts in the NWS will enshittify forecasts overall, and it’s only logical to expect crappier forecasts will leave the public with less ability to prepare for or escape storms. But unless reduced staff causes some really glaring bit of information to go missing, it’ll be very hard to connect the job cuts to particular storm losses. We forecast dangerous levels of gaslighting on all this. Share [AP / PBS Newshour / CNN / WAVE-TV / Inside Climate News / Bloomberg (gift link)] Yr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tariff ‘Liberation Day’ Sinks Stocks As China Retaliates

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump’s tariff “Liberation Day” turned into a Wall Street bloodbath. The tariffs on nearly all foreign nations are widely expected to raise prices for American consumers. And despite the White House’s insistence that they would not cause “pain,” investors are already feeling it. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, and the Nasdaq cratered 6%—their steepest daily percentage losses since 2020. The “Magnificent Seven” tech companies that drove much of the gains in recent years were the biggest losers from the tariff losses, but retail also struggled, as many firms manufacture their goods abroad. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Wall Street is souring on President Donald Trump. A new Forbes survey of 50 Wall Street bigs shows that many who supported the Trump campaign’s economic promises before he took office have abandoned him, with a vast majority now disapproving of the president’s economic policies. More than half of our respondents supported Trump’s economic plan as he reentered the White House in January, but 72% now say the Trump team’s economic plan has been ineffective. China will impose an additional 34% import duty on all U.S. goods starting next week, in retaliation against President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 34% “reciprocal tariff” on Chinese goods, the state media announced on Friday. All three major futures indexes nosedived sharply after the Chinese announcement, with Dow Futures falling nearly 2.9%, the benchmark S&P 500 dropping nearly 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures down 3.1%. Small business owners looking to borrow money from lending institutions may have to answer a new question: How will President Donald Trump’s tariffs affect their business? And while some companies may benefit long-term if manufacturing returns to the U.S., many will suffer in the interim because they can’t fully pass on increased costs to customers. The DOGE cuts made what would have otherwise been a “fairly quiet” March for layoffs the worst since spring 2020, a new report found. Employers shed more than 275,000 positions last month, and the first three months of the year saw the most quarterly jobs cut since Q1 in 2009, during the Great Recession. RH Chairman and CEO Gary Friedman Thursday’s tariff-induced stock market losses wiped almost $300 billion from the fortunes of the world’s billionaires, and some of the biggest losers are those who’ve tried to make recent in-roads with Trump. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg saw his wealth fall by $17.9 billion since Wednesday’s market close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who was $16 billion poorer on Thursday. In percentage terms, the biggest billionaire loser of the trade war was Gary Friedman, the CEO of retailer RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, whose fortune tanked from $1.2 billion on Tuesday to an estimated $750 million Thursday, a drop of 39%. About an hour into the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Friedman was heard reacting as shares fell 26% in after-hours trading: “Oh sh*t,” he said. MORE: Meanwhile, the day’s biggest winner was Latin America’s richest person, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, who got $2.1 billion richer as of Thursday afternoon. Mexico was not subject to additional tariffs in Trump’s announcement. Plaid CEO Zach Perret After its latest $575 million fundraise, Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is valued at $6.1 billion—less than half the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. Still, the fintech market has gotten a recent boost following a downward trajectory that began in 2022, with fintechs raising roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally in the first quarter of 2025, according to CB Insights. Illustration by Fernando Capeto for Forbes; Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images and Justin Sullivan/Getty Images There’s a long, storied list of famous auto industry flops, from stinkers like Ford’s Edsel and exploding Pinto to General Motors’s unsightly Pontiac Aztek crossover SUV. Elon Musk’s pet project, the dumpster-driving Tesla Cybertruck, now tops it. After a little over a year at market, sales of the 6,600-pound vehicle, priced from $82,000, are laughably below what Musk predicted. Its lousy reputation for quality—with eight recalls in the past 13 months—and polarizing look made it a punchline for comedians. Unlike past auto flops that just looked ridiculous or sold badly, Musk’s truck is also a focal point for global Tesla protests spurred by the billionaire’s job-slashing DOGE role and MAGA politics. Judged solely on sales, Musk’s Cybertruck is actually doing a lot worse than Edsel, a name that’s become synonymous with a disastrous product misfire. Ford hoped to sell 200,000 Edsels a year when it hit the market in 1958, but managed just 63,000. Sales plunged in 1959 and the brand was dumped in 1960. Musk predicted that Cybertruck might see 250,000 annual sales. Tesla sold just under 40,000 in 2024, its first full year. There’s no sign that volume is rising this year, with sales trending lower in January and February, according to Cox Automotive. WHY IT MATTERS “Musk’s miscalculation of what pickup truck buyers want was a costly one, as Tesla likely invested an estimated $900 million to develop Cybertruck,” says Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. “The fact that those costs can’t be shared with other Tesla vehicles compounds the problem. Tesla’s billionaire CEO once bragged that he does ‘no market research whatsoever.’ In retrospect, he might want to start.” MORE Things Are Bad At Tesla. They’re About To Get Much Worse. President Donald Trump’s tariffs will likely increase prices for a number of goods, from new cars to coffee and iPhones. The tariffs include a baseline 10% rate, with some trading partners facing higher taxes: $2,300: The potential price tag of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, assuming a 43% price increase for the devices as predicted by analysts from Rosenblatt Securities to offset the cost of tariffs 80%: The share of coffee beans imported into the U.S. that come from Latin America, where top producers face 10% tariffs 20%: The tariff that wine produced across European Union nations will face, with France and Italy being the U.S.’s top suppliers in 2021 The stock market’s recent losses are a reminder that your stock portfolio is a long-term asset. While it’s okay to pick individual stocks for a small share of your investments (think 10%), the rest should be in a fund. The most important consideration when evaluating a stock ETF is that it should be big and cheap, so your savings don’t get eroded by annual fees—but it’s also important to look at factors like taxes. President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs target more than 180 nations, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands, considered to be one of the wildest and most remote places on Earth. The islands are territory of which country? A. The United Kingdom B. Australia C. Denmark D. France Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Stocks may extend their post-tariff sell-off Friday after China retaliated with its own 34% duties on all U.S. goods, restrictions on rare earth exports, and other measures. Futures linked to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all pointing to a lower open. The Magnificent 7 stocks extend their slide on Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.89%) plunging 3.6% and Apple (AAPL-4.15%) dropping 4.8% in premarket trading as of 8:50 a.m. EDT. Declines were 5.4% for Meta (META+2.71%), 6.2% for Amazon (AMZN+2.61%), 5.1% for Tesla (TSLA-2.73%), 1.6% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.59%), and 2.7% for Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL+0.84%). Shoe and garment makers extended their sell-off as they face tariffs on their Asian-made products. Nike (NKE-3.06%) fell 5% before the bell, Lululemon (LULU+0.45%) slid 5%, and Uggs-maker Deckers (DECK-0.55%) declined 4.4%. Energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM-1.35%), Chevron (CVX-2.00%), and ConocoPhillips (COP-0.49%) declined on recession fears. Equities markets had their worst day in five years Thursday as the S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%. Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump showed no signs of backing down on his plans to impose tariffs that are more severe than expected.“It’s going very well,” he said, comparing the imposition of tariffs with surgery and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. Friday, a government report showed that the U.S. labor market held up better than expected in March despite the federal government’s layoffs, the crackdown on immigrants, and surveys showing that consumers and businesses are increasingly anxious about the economy. Employers added 228,000 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising from a downwardly revised 117,000 in February and beating the average estimate of 130,00. The jobless rate nonetheless increased to 4.2% from 4.1%, and hourly wages increased 0.30%, both matching projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook at 11:25 a.m. EDT. Other central bank speakers include Michael Barr — who will talk about AI and banking — and Christopher Waller. Some stocks to watch today: Blackstone’s (BX-0.30%) stocks slid 4.4% in premarket trading. The investment company is considering selling two AirTrunk data centers in Australia for about A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) each to fund the Australian unit’s growth, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. Constellation Brands (STZ-0.56%), which makes, imports, and distributes alcoholic beverages, reported sales and per-share profit that were slightly higher than the average analyst estimates on FactSet. The stock fell 2.1% in premarket trading. Exxon stock fell 2.6% before the open. The energy giant may report a $2.7 billion gain in profit in the first quarter from the prior three months, with fuel manufacturing the largest contributing factor, Bloomberg reported, citing a company filing. Guess (GES-11.43%) stock dropped 5.6% in premarket trading after plunging 11.8% on Thursday. The garment maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales and per-share profit that exceeded analyst expectations. The company’s guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue also topped consensus.

Former Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron joined MediaBuzz to discuss why he is disgusted with Bezos new mandate and why the move has garnered backlash at the publication. The Washington Post has faced an exodus of talent in recent months and remaining staffers, particularly in the Opinions section, are on pins and needles waiting to see where the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper is heading. Billionaire owner Jeff Bezos has routinely irked current and former employees since he famously stopped the editorial page from endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, prompting several staffers to leave the paper. His latest high-profile decision pushed Opinions section editor David Shipley out the door and put the unit in limbo until a replacement is named, a staffer told Fox News Digital. Discouraged Post employees feel it’s not the best time to work in the paper’s Opinions section and aren’t sure if Bezos’ relationship with President Donald Trump will impact who replaces Shipley. Staffers also feel that things haven’t been quite the same since the sudden 2021 death of treasured editorial page editor Fredd Hiatt. At the time, Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote that Hiatt’s unexpected passing marked the end of "a period of remarkable stability at the top of The Washington Post’s masthead."

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images; SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) "Remarkable stability" is certainly not a term that Post’s staffers would use to describe their place of employment nowadays. Hiatt, who predated Bezos’ takeover of the paper, was eventually replaced by Shipley after a months-long process that saw the paper’s Opinions section go leaderless for the first half of 2022. Opinions section staffers are currently frustrated that they worked through a long interregnum only three years ago, and now they’re doing that again. Bezos announced in February that Shipley had decided to step away when the Amazon founder pushed for major changes to the Post’s Opinions section. "We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others," Bezos wrote on X, announcing the decision. Bezos said Shipley was offered the opportunity to continue to lead the opinion section and declined. Now, Opinions section employees are aware that it takes quite a while to solicit applicants and conduct interviews for such a high-profile position and staffers are concerned that they’ll either be without a leader for another extended period, or that rushing the process will result in yet another transition in the near future if the hire isn’t up to the task. Following Bezos’ decision not to endorse Harris, 11 Post opinion columnists wrote a statement calling the decision a "terrible mistake." The decision also irked liberal staffers and readers alike, but Bezos has repeatedly defended the decision.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Eyebrows inside the Post were raised even further since Election Day, as Bezos visited Mar-a-Lago and attended Trump’s inauguration, indicating their once-frosty relationship has healed for the moment. Trump claimed in a recent interview with OutKick's Clay Travis that Bezos disparaged some of his own newspaper's staffers as "crazy people." Longtime Washington Post reporter Paul Farhi left the paper in 2023 but keeps a close eye on his former employer and believes morale issues loom large. "There’s great disappointment in Bezos and widespread suspicion and concern about his relationship with Trump," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Still unclear how Bezos’ remaking of the editorial pages is going to play out -- not sure it will be more pro-Trump, although that is also the prevailing suspicion," Farhi added. "My sense is that morale continues to be terrible." A Washington Post spokesperson declined comment on "personnel updates," but noted a series of recent accolades the Opinions section has achieved, including the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Explanatory Reporting.

(SAUL LOEB/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) While the Opinions section waits for a new leader, other departments have also hemorrhaged both money and talent. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Post "lost around $100 million" in 2024 as subscriptions and ad-revenue plummeting took a toll on the paper. The paper has also seen layoffs and top journalists, including Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Hannah Allam, and Matea Gold have all left. Longtime liberal columnist Eugene Robinson also left the paper on Thursday, marking the latest high-profile exit. Another liberal columnist, Jennifer Rubin, fled the Post earlier this year in protest of Bezos. TRUMP APPLAUDS JEFF BEZOS’ CHANGES AT WASHINGTON POST IN RARE MEDIA PRAISE The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the paper after her bosses rejected her illustration depicting Bezos groveling to Trump. Opinion columnist Ruth Marcus recently announced she was leaving the paper after a 40-year stint, citing Bezos' plans to reshape the Opinions section. Marcus said Bezos and other tech tycoons who attended the inauguration were akin to being Trump’s "trophies."

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool via REUTERS) "His presence on the inaugural platform conveyed a message of support for Trump that, I can say now, was inappropriate," Marcus wrote in the New Yorker. Farhi said the "bright side" is that the news side of the Post has "been doing superb reporting" on Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk’s efforts to crack down on government spending. Farhi has noticed that Bezos and CEO Will Lewis have refrained from "meddling" in straight-news coverage and that Trump hasn’t been criticizing the paper on social media, which was a common practice during his first administration. "It’s possible Bezos has come to some kind of truce with Trump, but at great cost to his integrity and to the integrity of the Post," Farhi said.

Title: Disney, Netflix, AI, More—Newest Winners In Digital Advertising
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddoty/2025/04/03/disney-netflix-ai-more-newest-winners-in-digital-advertising/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T15:12:48Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Doty ByDavid Doty, Contributor. The race to digital dominance always has new players The worrisome, repeat noise about the lack of aggressive competition in digital advertising just doesn’t correspond to the reality of the industry. If you follow this column, you’ve know we cover the spectrum of ongoing dynamics in the field. For sure, there are complaints about news outrage fatigue, strangling AI slop, massive layoffs and odd doings at media companies owned loudly or quietly by billionaires (Hello, X, WashPo, LA Times and TIME to name just a few). All the handwringing couldn’t be further from the truth in the real marketplace. A simple step back to look at the big picture shows the entire digital ecosystem is growing at an incredible clip. Massive sums are being invested in AI, with a record, eye-popping $40-billion funding in OpenAI just announced. On the advertising front alone, spending in the U.S. reached $309.3 billion in 2024, a 15.1% increase over 2023, and it is expected to reach $460 billion by 2028. Other industries would kill for that kind of growth. And it’s not exclusily focused on a few, it’s spread among many, and new, players. For sure, the digital ecosystem has and will continue to change—radically. Who’s up, who’s down actually takes a lot of attention to understand. The simplistic view of the industry just isn’t the smart take. We’re all wearing seat belts and goggles as we discover the joys of being crash-test dummies in lightning-speed realignments that used to take years but are now happening in months and weeks (recent case in point: the rapid adoption of generative AI). Digital is hot all over, the state of play is dynamic—and growing like crazy. Disney reports its streaming platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) have an estimated 157 million global monthly active users on ad-supported tiers, including 112 million in the U.S. So, the lesson should be: Despite the influence of any incumbents in the field, new creative players with the right content can get a lot of people not just to watch ads but to opt into watching them. Simultaneously, Netflix, which we should remember started offering ads only two years ago, is projected to top $3.2 billion in ad revenue this year thanks to live sports and events, and more than half of that will come from the U.S. and Canada. Not bad for a nascent part of its business. CTV advertising? Emerging and struggling, some say. But this year it will reach $33.35 billion and is on its way to eclipsing linear TV in 2028. Change sometimes is hard—and then sometimes seems easier than we’d thought it would be. That other new virgorous channel, retail media, is also booming. Total retail media ad impressions surged past 75 billion at the end of 2025. Amazon remains the giant in this space, reporting $56.21 billion in revenue in 2024, and just five years ago that mostly retailer was barely a player in digital ads. Other retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Chewy and Sephora looked around and saw they, too, could compete in the digital advertising game and are now seeing a bigger and bigger share of ad impressions (and ad $$) come their way. There are more interesting fireworks in retail media, too. Despite all the noise about Chinese influence in other place, it turns out that small Chinese sellers make up nearly half of the new sellers added to Walmart’s retail media marketplace, following Amazon’s path (also 50%). With on-again/off-again/on-again/who-knows?again tariffs and how they are reshaping global trade dynamics, much could shift in that landscape and already has: Fast fashion retailer Shein’s profit was down 40% at the end of 2024, threatening the viability of the company’s IPO in 2025 and leaving the opportunity for other retailers to fill the void. Can U.S. domestics slip in to fill any voids–and capture not just the retail revenue but the data dominance? Also gaining ground are new corners of the digital media universe: Trusted recommendations from influencers are an ever-growing force for brands (CMOs, you ignore them at your peril) and the latest consumer powerhouse is communities that let customers talk to peers about products they love (and hate). They are gaining new power in the buying equation. And all that doesn’t even count the unforeseeable but certainly likely incredible speed at which new media can explode onto the scene. Snapchat took almost four years to hit 100 million users. TikTok got there in 9 months. ChatGPT did it in 8 weeks. Threads in 5 days! As I said, the state of play is dynamic and downright … quantum. So don’t believe in the negative or be a skeptic and fatalist: It’s an incredible time to be in the media business—whether you’re creating content, capturing attention, or some mix of both. Your business could be, faster than you know, larger than the largest now. Just look around at what is happening IRL.

Title: Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks

ByDr. Diane Hamilton ByDr. Diane Hamilton, Contributor. Outsmarting The System: White Fonting, Fake Reviews, And Résumé Hacks Never underestimate people’s ability to get creative. Job seekers are adding invisible keywords to résumés to beat applicant tracking systems. Students are using AI tools like ChatGPT to rewrite essays in ways traditional plagiarism detectors cannot always catch. Amazon sellers are inflating ratings with fake reviews, and content creators are joining engagement pods to fool social media algorithms. Across industries, individuals are finding ways to get past automated filters, strict systems, and rigid evaluation processes. In many cases, it is about outsmarting processes that feel impossible to navigate fairly. What may seem like manipulation often reflects frustration, curiosity, and a desire to be seen. From white fonting to résumé rewriting to gaming content platforms, these behaviors raise bigger questions. If people are constantly outsmarting the system, what does that say about the system itself? And what can leaders, hiring teams, and educators learn from these increasingly common tactics? What Is White Fonting And Why Are Job Seekers Outsmarting The System? White fonting is a résumé trick where applicants insert key phrases in white text so they are invisible to human readers but still readable by applicant tracking systems. A candidate applying for a marketing role might hide words like HubSpot, content strategy, or Google Ads throughout their document even if they lack those skills. The goal is to bypass keyword filters and get a shot at an interview. While it may seem dishonest, many job seekers using white fonting do not see it that way. They are trying to be noticed in a system that feels too automated, too rigid, and too competitive. For them, outsmarting the résumé filter is more of a survival skill than a scam. Do Résumé Hacks Still Work When Outsmarting AI Filters? Résumé hacks like white fonting, keyword stuffing, and AI-generated job applications can still work in some cases. In addition to hiding text, job seekers may repeat desirable phrases or inflate their job titles to appear more qualified. However, today’s applicant tracking systems are more sophisticated. Many strip formatting, detect excessive repetition, and flag suspicious content. Outsmarting the AI might work once, but it can also backfire if a recruiter notices inconsistencies or patterns that look inauthentic. What is more telling is why candidates feel they have to use these tactics in the first place. In a process designed to automate decisions, standing out as a human is becoming harder. How Students Have Been Outsmarting Plagiarism Detectors For Years Before white fonting showed up in résumés, I had already seen similar tactics in education. Some of my own students told me they used to wrap copied text in white quotation marks to get around plagiarism software. These days, it's more likely they’re using ChatGPT to rewrite their papers. But getting around the system isn’t new. Students have found ways to outsource their work for years. I once had a student submit a paper that included the following at the bottom, something she clearly forgot to delete: “Thank you for purchasing this paper. That will be fifteen dollars.” I believe the price has gone up since then. While those kinds of shortcuts were easier to spot, the tools students use now are more sophisticated. Grammarly, for example, was widely recommended as a writing aid, and many schools encouraged its use. But now it sometimes gets flagged in AI detection reports. What was once a tool to support learning might now complicate things. Whether it is helpful or harmful often depends on the intent behind it and the system doing the reviewing. Detection tools have gotten better at spotting tricks by looking at context and removing formatting. But the bigger issue is still there. When students believe the system is more focused on catching them than helping them learn, they will always find a way around it. Other Ways People Are Outsmarting Digital Systems The same mindset driving white fonting and AI-written essays shows up across nearly every platform. Social media influencers use engagement pods to artificially boost visibility. Sellers use brushing scams and fake reviews to rank higher on e-commerce sites. SEO specialists use keyword stuffing and cloaked pages to rise in search rankings. Test takers use screen mirroring, hidden devices, or even fake webcam movement to fool remote proctoring. Outsmarting the system has become a skill. But it is often a response to the feeling that the system itself is no longer working for the individual. Still, it raises a fair question. If people spent as much time doing the work as they do trying to get around it, wouldn’t that be more productive? Maybe. But when someone feels the odds are stacked against them, working around the system can feel like the only way forward. Why Outsmarting The System Happens In The First Place This behavior is not always about deception. More often, it is about frustration. People feel unseen by machines and blocked by rules they do not understand. They want in but do not know how to navigate the filters standing in the way. There is something deeper too. People are naturally curious. They test boundaries, push limits, and explore loopholes not always to break the rules but to understand them. Outsmarting is not always defiance. Sometimes it is innovation. Is Outsmarting The System Always Cheating? White fonting and similar behaviors fall on a spectrum. Sometimes they are clever ways to gain visibility. Other times they cross the line into deception. But if people are bending the rules just to be considered fairly, it may be time to examine the rules themselves. For job seekers, students, and creators, the issue is often not about ethics but about access. They are asking how else they can get a chance. How HR Professionals Can Respond To People Outsmarting The Hiring Process Rather than punish manipulation, HR teams should examine what is driving it. If people are outsmarting your hiring process, that is a signal. It means the process is perceived as unfair, overly filtered, or too impersonal. Here is what organizations can do: The best candidates may not always look perfect on paper. Sometimes, the most valuable hires are the ones trying the hardest to be seen. How Former Employees Are Outsmarting Company Reputation Systems The same mindset of outsmarting applies to company review sites. Some former employees have found ways to manipulate platforms like Glassdoor to damage an employer’s reputation. Tactics include mass posting negative reviews under multiple fake accounts, copy-pasting slightly altered feedback to create volume, or coordinating group efforts to flood a company’s page. Others wait for news of layoffs or leadership changes and time their reviews for maximum visibility. While Glassdoor uses fraud detection tools to identify suspicious content, no system is perfect. Some coordinated attacks can still get through. These actions are attempts to outsmart a system that may feel like the only way to hold a company accountable. For HR leaders and executives, these incidents are a reminder that reputation systems must be monitored, but they must also be trusted enough not to invite sabotage. What Outsmarting The System Says About Organizational Culture If people feel they need to cheat your system, the system may be part of the problem. White fonting, fake reviews, AI-generated content, and even coordinated review attacks all stem from environments where trust in the process has broken down. Instead of reinforcing complexity, organizations should examine what is encouraging these behaviors in the first place. Outsmarting the systems provides feedback. People are still trying. They want in. They are just not convinced that playing by the rules will work. The Real Question Behind Outsmarting The System Most people do not try to outsmart systems they trust. If outsmarting the system is happening everywhere, from classrooms to job boards to e-commerce platforms, it deserves serious attention. I once interviewed Dr. John Kotter, a renowned Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School and a leading expert on leadership and change. His work on resistance is especially relevant in this context because when people do not feel empowered within a system, they often look for ways to work around it. They are not necessarily resisting the outcome but rather the structure that feels unfair or unyielding. The future of work will increasingly depend on automation and algorithms, but it must also allow space for trust, transparency, and human creativity. If someone is trying to outsmart your system, the more important question is not how to stop them but what their actions are revealing about the system itself. Outsmarting the system is not going away, but there is an opportunity to design systems that are strong, fair, and human in ways that reduce the desire to bypass them.

Title: The U.S. Economy Is Being Led Over a Cliff by an Idiot and His Lemmings

By Dustin Rowles | News | April 3, 2025 | I hope everyone enjoyed their brief respite from the horrors of the current administration after a rare good day — well, half a day — because by 4 p.m. yesterday, the President delivered a rambling, nonsensical, and infuriating speech announcing a boatload of new tariffs that many are calling “worse than the worst-case scenario.” Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff across the board, excluding Mexico and Canada, which already face their own 25 percent tariffs. Countries he labeled “bad actors” are getting hit with cumulative tariffs as high as 60 percent. The EU is facing a 20 percent tariff. The UK — with whom we have a trade surplus — is still being slapped with a 10 percent tariff. The formula Trump used, which the internet reverse-engineered as completely batshit, is erratic at best. If the tariffs hold (and with Trump, who knows?), the country is effectively looking at a $600 billion annual tax. Grocery prices are going to rise. Electronics, sneakers, and clothing will get more expensive. Inflation will surge, and the stock market will sink. Early indicators suggest as much as a 5 percent drop in the NASDAQ when the bell rings this morning — unsurprising, given that the tech industry sources many of its parts from countries hit hardest by tariffs (China, Vietnam, India, Taiwan). The price of a new Subaru Crosstrek, I read, will rise by around $10,000. The new Nintendo Switch could jump by as much as $120, with new games rising by $30. Consumers will delay buying cars, computers, and washing machines, which will hurt retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart — leading to layoffs and a higher unemployment rate. We’ve seen this cycle before: companies slash advertising and marketing budgets, hurting giants like Google and Facebook and, by extension, the rest of the media. And the thing is, it’s all so f**king pointless. Ostensibly, the goal is to increase U.S. manufacturing, but we’re a service-based economy — and those services will be hit with retaliatory tariffs, triggering even more economic pain. The idea that companies like Nike or Apple will move their manufacturing to the U.S. ignores the reality: higher wages mean higher prices, which leads to more inflation. And even if companies wanted to come back, the U.S. isn’t equipped to restart large-scale manufacturing. It would take years — only to see the next administration (or Trump himself) reverse course again. The President of the United States doesn’t understand how the economy works, and the Republican Congress is too chickenshit to take back the tariff powers they do legally possess. Yesterday, the Senate — with help from a few Republican Senators (McConnell, Rand, Collins, and Murkowski) — passed legislation reversing the Canadian tariffs, but it’s expected to die in the House, despite the warning sign from the Florida special election about how vulnerable swing-state Republicans may be. Trump needs to be neutered. Congress has the power to do it. Instead, they’re pushing ahead with a plan to renew and expand the Trump tax cuts — to appease the billionaires currently taking a bath in the stock market. But even they may not see much of a net gain. For the rest of us: we get nothing but a faltering economy and shrinking 401Ks as the market continues its tumble. It’s bad. It’s real bad. There are no winners here. And the best we can hope for is that Trump panics at the market plunge and negotiates carve-outs or exceptions. But it may be too late. Hell, the rest of the world hates us now, too — because we’re tanking their economies right along with ours. We’re being led over a cliff by an idiot and his lemmings. But hey! At least the White House may push out Elon Musk in the coming weeks.

Title: Trump unveils new tariffs and CDC's IVF team is eliminated: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Global markets fall following Trump’s tariff announcements. The CDC team that tracked IVF across the country was eliminated. And a college student who was the subject of a viral rumor amplified by prominent figures said it “ruined” her life. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump announced expansive tariffs on the United States’ largest trading partners impacting billions, if not trillions, of dollars in trade. China would be hit with a 54% tariff, the European Union with 20%, India with 26% and Japan with 24%, among many others. The White House arrived at the percentages based on how it is calculating duties on U.S. exports, as well as “nonmonetary” trade barriers based on things like countries’ manipulating their currencies or serving as “pollution havens,” but it was not immediately clear how the exact numbers were calculated. China said it would “resolutely take countermeasures” against the U.S., with the Chinese Commerce Ministry calling Trump’s latest move “a typical act of unilateral bullying.” The European Union threatened countermeasures by mid-April, and Canada warned last week that it was preparing retaliatory moves. The Trump administration has signaled it is uninterested in diplomacy, raising the odds that foreign leaders will hit back with more levies of their own rather than pressing for talks. In other words, this trade war is just getting started, NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans and business and data correspondent Brian Cheung wrote in an analysis. “This is a game changer, not only for the U.S. economy, but for the global economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a note yesterday evening. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession.” Speaking from the White House Rose Garden yesterday afternoon, Trump slammed what he said were “much higher” import taxes on goods coming from the U.S. compared to what the U.S. had charged other countries for their exports. He argued that the U.S. has been getting “ripped off” by other nations while working-class wages languished. With these new tariffs, American industry “will be reborn,” the president said, touting a new “golden age of America.” But the tariffs won’t provide an immediate jolt to the economy. Instead, they’re expected to take a toll on many companies whose products rely on global supply chains and now could be forced to raise prices or endure thinner profit margins. The White House has warned of some pain ahead for consumers and businesses but said it is a trade-off that will be worthwhile eventually. Read the full story here, and follow our live blog for the latest reactions and fallout. Public health experts and IVF advocates said they are shocked at the elimination of the CDC's Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team — a group of six epidemiologists, data analysts and researchers that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. Their layoffs were part of the sweeping cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and come just a week after President Donald Trump declared himself "the fertilization president" while touting efforts to expand IVF. The team worked under the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted this week, and was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF. It also maintained an “IVF success estimator,” a tool that allowed people to estimate how well IVF would work for them and contained data about clinics’ success rates across the country. “This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,” said Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of a nonprofit group for reproductive health. An HHS official said the “work will continue” but did not provide details. Read the full story here. A 19-year-old University of Mississippi student who was the subject of an internet rumor amplified by notable figures including popular ESPN host and analyst Pat McAfee is speaking out, saying the barrage of harassment she received has “ruined” her life. It’s “the worst feeling in the world,” Mary Kate Cornett said in an interview with NBC News’ Tom Llamas. “It makes you feel so alone. It’s a horrible experience.” Cornett said her friends first told her about a rumor that was spreading on an anonymous messaging app called YikYak, about a student in her sorority who was sleeping with her boyfriend’s father. Eventually, she saw that her name was a trending topic on X. The rumor referenced on “The Pat McAfee Show” alleged a “ménage à trois” at Ole Miss, but Cornett and her boyfriend were not mentioned by name in the show. After Cornett’s number was shared online, she said she was overwhelmed with “thousands” of calls and texts, with some telling her she “deserved to die.” Cornett said she intends to take legal action against McAfee and ESPN, and potentially others who, she said, helped spread the rumor. “I’m not a public figure that you can go talk about on your show to get more views,” she said.

As an Arsenal soccer fan living more than 5,000 away in Los Angeles, I wanted a place to see the Gunners face Aston Villa earlier this season. My options were to watch alone at home, in a crowded bar or at a new venue called Cosm. I tried the latter and my mind was blown. Thanks to proprietary technology that includes cameras shooting live in 12K resolution, I was instantly transported to Villa Park in England. On an 87-foot diameter LED screen, players appeared super close. Crowd noise from the stadium filled the air as if you were part of the supporters’ section. It was the closest I’d get to actually being there. I returned to Cosm — which currently has locations in L.A. and Dallas, with Detroit and Atlanta opening in the coming months — to check out the NCAA Tournament.
