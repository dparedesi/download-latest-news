Title: Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Empire in Trouble?

By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | November 8, 2024 | For the past 16 years, Goop has been one of the shining lights in the celebrity business sphere. Gwyneth Paltrow’s woo-woo wellness company has endured a lot of jokes (and extremely legitimate criticism about its suspect claims and the people it supports), but it’s remained a major hit. In 2018, the New York Times reported that Goop was worth an estimated $250 million, thanks to its unusual wellness offerings like psychic vampire repellent and jade vagina eggs. Not bad for what started out as a newsletter by a bored actress. But now, reports are suggesting that Goop is stumbling. Last year, Goop opened a store in London, which closed quickly due to lack of interest. RadarOnline is claiming that closure led to around a $2 million loss for the company. Last week, Business Insider reported that Goop had undergone a second round of layoffs in only two months. In 2021, they also reported that 140 employees left the company in just two years. Among the issues cited were low salaries, poor leadership, and favoritism among the higher ranks. Yes, the pandemic shutdown didn’t help but the bleeding doesn’t seem to have stopped for Goop. Over the past month, things have gotten bad enough that The Times suggested that Goop is undergoing an entire business reshuffle just to stay afloat. Puck also got in on the act, reporting that, while Goop’s food vertical is doing well, the fashion and beauty parts are suffering. This is bad news given that they only recently launched a skincare line, available via Target. Puck wrote: Yikes. Puck then had sources saying that Paltrow seemed to have ‘disdain’ for some of the products she was selling, although Goop denied this in a statement. Goop has always been a strange and unique presence in the world of celebrity branding. It’s so specifically Gwyneth and so deliberately inaccessible to the biggest markets and demographics that it shouldn’t have worked. Yet it became the benchmark for the celeb business model for years, with many a copycat (hello, Blake Lively) and wannabes following in its bare footsteps. Goop was widely derided for questionable science and promotion of straight-up quackery but there is also a known and monied audience who love that crap. Paltrow was savvy in commodifying all of this faux-wellness nonsense and selling it to her fellow rich white ladies. She was also extremely good at monetising those rage clicks and playing along with her own parodic image, as evidenced by that vagina candle that sadly exploded from time to time. So, what changed? The wellness industry certainly hasn’t died; it’s only grown more powerful and intimidating since lockdown, and my Instagram feed is full of ‘self-care’ routines that are merely extended ads for a lot of Temu and Amazon crap. Rich lady companies are doing fine too, because that’s a demographic that stays rich regardless of the changing political tides. I don’t think it’s that we’re suddenly aware that Goop was peddling bullsh*t either. Sadly, snake oil and anti-pharma-driven rhetoric is extremely popular right now, and on all sides of the political spectrum. To me, it seems like Goop has never been a hugely reliable profit maker for Paltrow. She herself admitted that at a business summit with Forbes, saying, ‘Some years, we’ve doubled in growth. Some years, we are flat. Some years, we’re down, then we’re back up.’ She wasn’t a businesswoman who jumped into a gap in the market. She was an actress whose side-project became a thing and she went along with it. Plus, while there is a niche for what she sells, it’s not as wide as would be needed to sustain a multi-pronged, Fenty-esque empire. Selling your makeup line in Target at an affordable price is a good idea, but nobody expects Goop to be affordable or for the masses, least of all people who go to Target and know what they want. If you’re looking for a moisturizer and one of the celebs shilling it to you has a dodgy history with pseudoscience and also radiates ‘eat the poors,’ why would you buy it? Both skincare and clothing are crowded markets, even without the celeb brands in the mix. Where once everyone chased Gwyneth, now they all follow after Rihanna, and Fenty Beauty and Skin are killing it. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty is a billion-dollar brand too. Plenty of celebrities have tried and failed to make their brands in this field a hit. It’s an expensive gamble and even the biggest skincare addicts are hesitant to put all that money down for a new product just because a famous name is attached. At least with a booze line, you can still get drunk. If Goop is to survive, my guess is that it will be under someone else’s ownership. Puck certainly seemed to believe that a sale could happen in the future, which would make Paltrow even richer and probably result in more layoffs. Goop’s legacy is secure, but not in a great way. It was a landmark in modern celebrity branding, but it also further legitimized entire swaths of fake science, wellness nonsense, and quackery that was one step removed from anti-vax propaganda. As much as Paltrow tried to laugh off criticism and embrace her ‘white lady bullsh*t’ image, the reverberations of bad science and health-driven fearmongering are far mightier than a vagina candle.

Title: Is generative AI hitting a ceiling? Maybe, but investors don’t care

UPDATED 10:37 EST / NOVEMBER 08 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Of course the presidential election looms over everything, and I’ll just say one thing: Any executives or investors counting on President-elect Donald Trump keeping the vast majority of promises he has made are not as smart as they think they are. Maybe they just want their taxes and regulations cut, and they may well get those. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who believe we will now be entering a wonderland of building under a Trump administration, wonder if generative AI models are hitting their limits. A few other people have been baying at the moon about this for a while, so it’s worth pondering what that means for the current boom. Nonetheless, even if the current approach by some to create AGI isn’t the right way to go, that doesn’t mean there isn’t utility for users today, so investors keep pouring the money into AI companies such as Anthropic, Perplexity and Physical Intelligence. Speaking of big spending, those plans by Amazon, Meta and Google to jumpstart nuclear plants to power all that AI? They could take a while. An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management this week calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions — few of which seem all that compelling ways to spur innovation. It’s still not entirely clear what’s going on with Supermicro’s books, but investors don’t like the signs one bit as its stock tanked again this week as its revenue missed estimates as well. Other earnings reports came in decidedly mixed. Arm and Qualcomm did pretty well partly on AI momentum, and so did GlobalFoundries, but NXP not so much. Cloudflare and Akamai also provided disappointing guidance. Broadcom expanded its VMware private-cloud options, which could prove good timing for the special edge needs of AI. Next week is KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City. TheCUBE will be there and SiliconANGLE will have the news and analysis. I’ll be at BoxWorks in San Francisco too. Earnings reports slow down, but next week we’ll be looking at Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, among a few others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend, for some lean-back reading. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: Breaking Analysis: Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s biggest competitor Are generative AI models topping out in their capabilities? Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz think they are, at least for now. Some people warned us. David Linthicum digs in: What do multimodal AI and smaller language models mean for enterprises? A glimpse with George Gilbert into Uber’s cutting-edge data approach: Uber revamps its operating model with real-time data and microservice orchestration Federal court sides with OpenAI in AI copyright lawsuit Hedge fund Coatue is raising $1B for AI bets Amazon reportedly mulls another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic – but with an added twist Perplexity AI’s value to soar to $9B as it finalizes new $500M funding round AIs will need physical knowledge at least as much as text knowledge, so perhaps feedback from robots using AI brains will help: AI startup Physical Intelligence raises $400M to create a brain for any robot Siit raises $5M for its AI-powered service desk platform Nvidia announces new robot AI learning and simulation tools Anthropic partners with AWS and Palantir to provide AI models to defense agencies UnifyApps reels in $20M for its AI-powered application platform Diliko launches agentic AI-powered data management platform for midsized enterprises MuleSoft helps businesses create real-time AI agents with AsyncAPI support View Systems launches AI-optimized data management platform There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Amazon, Meta nuclear power initiatives reportedly encounter challenges An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions. Perhaps some of those are good ideas in concept, but it’s not that convincing to me, especially the stock buybacks front and center. One would hope Andy Jassy and Matt Garman have better ideas. (Though admittedly they could have done a lot better on “Rings of Power.”) Cloudbrink co-founder’s lawsuit draws attention of the SEC and DOJ Supermicro’s stock falls on revenue miss and uncertainty over annual filing, increasing fears of a delisting Qualcomm and Arm cruise to another earnings and revenue beat NXP tumbles on weak outlook as automotive chip revenue declines GlobalFoundries shares jump on strong mobile business growth Kyndryl sees good traction with AI consulting services, and its stock moves higher Disappointing guidance sends Cloudflare and Akamai stocks lower Datadog tops earnings expectations amid cybersecurity, AI growth Rapid7’s revenue and earnings top forecasts amid product enhancements Fortinet shares dip despite beating revenue and earnings estimates Dynatrace shares close lower despite strong second quarter Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand DigitalOcean shares drop 13% despite expectation-topping earnings, raised guidance Astera Labs delivers blowout earnings and revenue beat and its stock jumps Palantir shares surge over 12% on strong earnings and raised revenue outlook Lyft shares surge over 20% as revenue growth outpaces expectations despite earnings miss HubSpot earnings top forecasts with 20% revenue growth and customer gains Five9 shares surge over 20% following strong quarter and upgraded guidance JFrog’s stock stutters on lukewarm guidance, despite accelerating revenue and customer wins And more… Broadcom broadens private cloud options And Zeus Kerravala’s analysis: VMware’s bevy of updates to VCF at Explore Barcelona 2024: Here’s why they matter AMD overtook Intel for the first time in data center revenue in the third quarter, according to SemiAnalysis TSMC, GlobalFoundries reportedly complete CHIPS Act funding negotiations EU launches antitrust probe into Apple glass supplier Corning IonQ snaps up quantum networking company Qubitekk, but financial results disappoint investors Rackspace offers GPUs as a cloud service with spot instance pricing We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps CrowdStrike acquires cloud security provider Adaptive Shield Malwarebytes acquires VPN provider AzireVPN Attack & response That’s a lot of dough: Ransomware gang demands ransom payment in Schneider Electric data breach: baguettes Canada arrests suspected hacker over breach of 160+ Snowflake users’ data Google’s Big Sleep AI model sets world first with discovery of SQLite security flaw City of Columbus acknowledges data theft after lawsuit against security researcher JFrog report highlights critical security flaws in machine learning platforms White-noise apps exploited in major audio ad fraud schemes, report finds Fortinet expands generative AI in cybersecurity portfolio with new FortiAI integrations Permiso launches three open-source tools to enhance cloud security detection Kloudfuse enhances observability platform with AI tools and scalable data management More cybersecurity news here Amazon gets green light to start drone deliveries in Arizona Lyft inks new partnerships to make autonomous taxis available through its app TikTok told to close its business in Canada amid national security concerns Bad timing for the New York Times as its tech union goes on strike And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Mozilla‘s open internet advocacy efforts falter as it lays off 30% of its staff Gabor Cselle, co-founder and former CEO of defunct X rival Pebble, has joined OpenAI to work on a “secretive project” (per TechCrunch).Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta’s former head of augmented reality hardware, is also joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware.

Title: Airbnb is on the hunt for growth

Good morning. Jay-Z has 99 problems, but Block ain’t one…for now, anyway. Executives at the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey—or is it Rick Rubin? I can barely tell their beards apart these days—have ordered staff not to mention the board member and Beyoncé spouse on internal channels, according to Fortune colleague Kali Hays. No one’s quite sure why, but successive layoffs at music streaming service Tidal—which Block quixotically bought from Jay-Z—haven’t helped. Perhaps Dorsey should channel zenmaster-megaproducer Rubin after all: “Do what you can with what you have. Nothing more is needed.” —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. Airbnb said Thursday it wants to accelerate its growth and prepare for the company’s next chapter “beyond accommodations.” In a letter to shareholders, the lodging marketplace said it made headway making it easier for people to host, making its namesake app more helpful (including clearing out low-quality listings), and expanding beyond its core markets. The last point is most interesting. Airbnb operates in a number of countries and regions it considers “under-penetrated.” In Q3, the company said it was able to boost the average growth rate of nights booked in those markets to more than double its core set. Airbnb reported $2.73 billion in third-quarter revenue, barely beating Wall Street’s estimates. It also reported earnings per share of $2.13, just missing expectations. As for its future beyond lodging? We’ll see “next year,” the company says. Speculation runs rampant for what that means, but rest assured the company will leverage its strength in building a “moat,” as CEO Brian Chesky put it last year, around its existing customer base. —AN Baidu is reportedly preparing to unveil a pair of smart glasses with a built-in AI assistant. A new Bloomberg report says the company, which is to China what Google is to the U.S., plans to showcase the product at its annual company event in Shanghai next week. The specs will have all the usual trappings: built-in cameras for photos and videos, a built-in microphone for voice interactions, and Baidu’s Ernie large language model underpinning it all. Hopefully the product will look as good as Meta’s Ray-Bans, which were released more than a year ago in partnership with global eyewear juggernaut EssilorLuxottica. The combination of tech and style has proven unbeatable—who doesn’t look good in a pair of Blues Brothers-esque Wayfarers?—even if the underlying tech is getting long in the tooth. Baidu will reportedly charge less than Meta’s $300 for its eyewear, which is expected early next year. But like Meta’s specs, the real question is how well it accelerates use of its various Internet-connected, ad-based services where the revenue is really made. —AN Remember the days when people were having conversations about armies theoretically using AI? Now AI has been used in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza (for drone piloting and target identification respectively) and AI companies are jostling for space at the Defense Department’s table. Days after Meta announced a bouquet of partnerships with military contractors, Anthropic, Palantir and Amazon Web Services have revealed a three-headed competitor. Anthropic’s Claude LLM will be integrated into Palantir’s intelligence-analysis system, with the whole thing running on AWS. Amazon is Anthropic’s biggest investor, and the pair already offer their joint services to the U.S. government. OpenAI, which quietly changed its terms earlier in the year to allow this, is also now looking for DOD business. It’s now the military-AI-industrial complex. —David Meyer Shares of Pinterest took a double-digit-percentage dive, to about $29, in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company offered fourth-quarter guidance below Wall Street’s expectations. The social media company said it expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. The midpoint of that range trails analyst estimates of $1.143 billion. Pinterest’s CFO, Julia Donnelly, said on a conference call that the company saw softer demand from food and beverage advertisers in Q3, dragging down its $898 million in quarterly revenue (which was otherwise up 18% from the same period last year). That will continue in Q4, she said—which aligns with the outlook of other ad-based businesses during the recent spate of corporate earnings reports. Another thing to note? Pinterest’s expenses. They were up 17% year over year, to $904 million, from R&D investment and spending on employees with AI expertise. —AN Tech’s biggest executives pretty much ignored Donald Trump after he won the White House in the shocking presidential election in 2016. This time around? Not so much. According to various reports over the last few months, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg privately reached out to Trump before voting began for the recent election. “They flattered him,” a New York Times summary reads. “They shared their troubles. They criticized his opposition. They emphasized common enemies.” And they hoped for better business. Trump went out of his way during his first term to criticize—or outright punish—the tech companies who opposed him. After Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2016 that Trump’s stated refusal to concede the election if he lost (he didn’t) “erodes our democracy around the edges,” among other things, Trump allegedly pushed the Pentagon to deny Amazon’s cloud computing unit a $10 billion defense contract. (A lawsuit was later dismissed.) Fast forward to today. The Washington Post owner published on X just two days ago: “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella all had similar things to say. And the remaining Magnificent Seven tech CEOs, you ask? Tesla’s Elon Musk has hardly slowed in posting support for Trump on X, which he owns; meanwhile Nvidia’s Jensen Huang manages to escape with a nearly nonexistent social media presence. —AN —Binance billionaire “CZ” speaks after four months in prison. —Cloudflare expects softer sales in the wake of stiffer cybersecurity competition. —Toast has a blowout quarter. Shares of the restaurant app were up 15%. (Yes, chef.) —CFPB told workers not to use phones because of hack. Living life in a Salt Typhoon. —France regulator sniffing around Polymarket gambler.

Title: Mozilla Foundation cuts staff and eliminates advocacy division, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff”

Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Greetings, comms pros! Let’s look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% of staff while also cutting its advocacy function The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit wing of the company that makes the Firefox internet browser, is cutting jobs and getting rid of its advocacy function amid “a relentless onslaught of change”. Mozilla Foundation CCO Brandon Borman affirmed the layoffs in a memo to staff. According to Tech Crunch : “The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics. Mozilla is known for advocating for privacy and inclusion on the internet. This move brings some of that ethos into question going forward. For comms pros, it’s worth asking — what do you do when your company cuts a big part of your identity as a way of remaining stable? There’s no right answer, but one of the solutions is to dive headfirst into employee experience as it ties into brand identity. Show your employees they matter and hedge that in messaging that proves you’re still the great place to work they were onboarded with originally. Organizational identities change — that’s part of business. But you can remind people that the cultural positives they relate to are the same — that’s how you communicate your way through these types of major shifts. 2 . Amazon CEO says RTO process isn’t a pretext for layoffs Amazon chief Andy Jassy denied that the company’s RTO mandate wasn’t intended as a method of covertly cutting jobs, but instead as a method of making the company’s culture stronger by having employees in the office five days a week. According to Reuters: “A number of people I’ve seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it’s a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,” said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said. It’s interesting to see the head of a company as big as Amazon address the speculation around an RTO process head-on. RTO programs should always consider culture as a guidepost for both the rollout and communication of the initiative. Any well-done RTO process needs to follow a checklist of sorts to find success. Earlier this year, we outlined RTO success points. The best RTOs can get off on the right foot by doing the following: It’s not enough to just say that culture matters — you need to show it in action. Once you call your people back, give them reasons to appreciate their time in the office, like more upskilling initiatives with colleagues and face time with leaders. There are benefits to working in the office — comms pros should highlight them, allow leaders to talk about them, and make them a central part of company culture beyond lip service. 3. NLRB files complaint against Apple for threatening employees who talked about compensation and work-from-home benefits The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against tech giant Apple, alleging that the organization threatened repercussions against employees who talked about their pay or working from home. MSN reported that according to accounts from former workers at the company, Apple employees were allegedly threatened when talking about bonuses, ordered to delete a social media post about how other employees could continue working remotely, and forced to stop mentioning their pay on internal comms platforms. Another, software engineer Cher Scarlett claimed that she was forced out of her role for creating an internal survey for employee compensation. Apple has yet to comment on the allegations. When employees feel they’re in a more open environment, they’re able to be their authentic selves and more likely to stay. In 2023, we covered the topic of job-hopping and how to combat it. In that piece, we cited a Flexjobs survey that stated 62% of employees cited toxic work environments as one of their top reasons to leaving a company, followed by pay at 59%. If your employees can’t talk about things they want to improve or their pay, there’s a good chance they won’t stick around, and those numbers prove it. Sure, Apple is one of the biggest-name corporations on the planet. But that doesn’t mean that the same rules don’t apply to employee satisfaction. Outreach via surveys and other touchpoints can help communicators gather information from employees about how they feel on topics like compensation, benefits and more. Running that info up the ladder to leaders can then affect change. Encourage your people to share their views. If you stifle them, you’re sowing the seeds for discontent and poor culture. 4.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! Good morning, Portland. I need to keep it real with you—I'm not doing too hot on an emotional level. I know I'm not alone in that feeling. But it's going to be 60 degrees and sunny out today (ahead of cold and rain for days to come) so I recommend going outside, taking a walk, trying to breathe. Now, am I going to do that? HELL NO! Just as your elementary school teachers lived in the school, I live in the computer and I cannot get out, even when it would serve me and others to do so. Okay, fine—I will try to take a short walk today. But you have to, too. I'm going to stop talking to myself now because I know what you came here for was the NEWS, not little platitudes about self-care. But, I mean, we should take care of ourselves. IN LOCAL NEWS: • THE SECOND ROUND OF CITY COUNCIL RESULTS ARE IN...and nothing has changed. Well, okay, the candidates who were leading on election night are still in good positions to win, though Multnomah County has more than 100,000 ballots left to count (and more are likely en route to the Elections Office). Right now, it's looking like there's going to be a pretty solid progressive majority on City Council, with candidates Tiffany Koyama Lane and Mitch Green (both endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America) in good positions to win a seat. Other notable progressive candidates in the top three of their districts include Candace Avalos (D1), Sameer Kanal (D2), and Angelita Morillo (D3). This evening's drop should bring a bit more certainty, but there's good reason for optimism. Business poured a ton of money into these races and money was unable to compete with community, a strong ground game, and the literal power of love and friendship (yes I’m talking about me and Tiffany 😂) BUT! I buried the lede here, because we do know one thing: Keith Wilson is going to be Portland's next mayor. Current Mayor Ted Wheeler posted his congratulations on social media, and mayoral candidate Rene Gonzalez said he conceded the race. We ranked Wilson second on our list of endorsements, and his win is a pretty resounding disapproval of our current City Council members, three of whom ran mayoral campaigns of their own. Also...our city sure has a type. • Commissioners Rene Gonzelez, Mingus Mapps, and Dan Ryan have dropped their controversial, expensive plan to terminate the city's homeless services agreement with Multnomah County. Why? Well, as much as I'd like to think common sense prevailed, it seems more likely that Gonzalez and Mapps are just not in the mood for political stunts following their poor showing in Tuesday's mayoral election. The trio pulled the agenda item to consider terminating the joint homeless response agreement a little more than 24 hours before it was set to be considered by Council today. And folks, this is a win! Terminating the Homelessness Response Services Intergovernmental Agreement between the city of Portland and Multnomah County would've cost about $40 million in cold hard cash and even more in wasted energy and political capital. Plus, with the intergovernmental agreement dissolution off the table, it's official: Gonzalez really did not do ANYTHING during his short time in Portland City Hall. (And I feel confident saying he will not be productive in his lame duck period.) No matter what happens with the new City Council, it's only uphill from here. Last night was a repudiation of this kind of politics. Good to pull it as 2/3 of its sponsors will not even be on the next council. I'm calling on council to also pull the Clean and Safe ESD vote from next week's agenda. Let the next council take that up. https://t.co/I0e6DXbDCB • If you're looking for some non-election related news, our Corbin Smith has you covered with a wonderful recap and stunning photos from the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) Global Championship this past weekend, where Portland's roller derby squad won the day. Smith says the roller derby championship was "sports. Major sports." So READ ALL ABOUT IT RIGHT HERE. • There's really not much local news available right now that's not related to the election (which is fair and good and obviously important but I figure you guys might want to read about something else for a second of your day). But there is this: Intel is bringing back free coffee and tea for employees. This was an employee benefit it slashed during budget cuts last summer, but in an attempt to improve employee morale, it's back. The chipmaker is currently doing layoffs at its Oregon facility and has cut other, more important employee benefits that will likely not return, but I guess a cost-benefit analysis showed saving money on coffee wasn't worth the fight. If Mike Rogoway at the Oregonian deems it important, who am I to disagree? (That wasn't sarcasm, Rogoway's a great reporter.) IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • The country is reacting to the news of a second Trump presidency, and there are obviously some different takes. I took note of a few notable perspectives during the rare moments when I was able to make the outrageously difficult effort to lift my head from my pillow yesterday. Senator Bernie Sanders (of "Bernie would've won" fame) probably said it best, IMO. Sanders wrote in a statement yesterday that "It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change." He also acknowledged the futility of asking the "big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party" to "learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign." A post shared by Bernie Sanders (@berniesanders) "Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not," Sanders wrote. DAMN. That's harsh but real. I hope others will join Bernie in calling on the Democratic Party to meet the moment instead of handing their ass to the increasingly fascistic Republicans. I do believe the election results also need to fall on the MAGA fools who have sold their soul to the devil in exchange for the promise of cheaper gas, but we aren't going to win by further alienating the working class. The Democrats better start bringing something to the table, or it'll be even more Joever than it is right now. • Among the MANY deep concerns I have about Trump's reelection, the climate crisis ranks at the top. Trump is a known climate denier and has stated his desire to boost oil production, get rid of subsidies for electric cars, and overall do a bunch of damage to any small amount of progress we've been able to make on the climate crisis in the last four years. So I'm freaking out, because this issue isn't exactly something we have time to fuck around on. Something that made me feel a bit better: Clean energy analysts and activists say though a second Trump administration will make it harder to transition to renewable and clean energy, it won't make it impossible. The market has already embraced clean energy for its financial benefits and the economic devastation that climate change is and will continue to cause. And that's not changing. (Obviously, the free market is not going to solve the climate crisis, but that reality would remain the same under any capitalist president.) Also, there are a lot of climate activists and scientists and lawyers who are a lot smarter than I am and already planning their resistance to Trump's inevitably horrible policies. If you, too, are deeply worried about climate action under Trump, consider supporting or joining an environmental organization or law group. Also, ride your bike more. Even if it won't solve the climate crisis on its own, it'll make you feel a little better. A post shared by NRDC (@nrdc_org) Now, topic change needed for my sanity. Sorry. • A federal labor judge ruled Amazon workers in Alabama should get a third chance to vote on unionizing. The first time warehouse workers at a facility in Bessemer voted about unionizing in 2021, they voted no, but labor officials ruled that Amazon influenced the vote and the result shouldn't be expected. Workers voted again in 2022, but the election was too close to call and has remained in limbo. Now, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ordered a third election. But Amazon, AKA Union Busters R US, will surely contest the decision and continue to stomp union activity wherever it can. And under a Trump NLBR...ugh. The doom is creeping in. Sorry. Just here to report the news. • There's a major wildfire in Southern California, just northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuation orders for more than 10,000 people. Powerful winds are fanning the flames and the fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and blanketed neighborhoods in smoke. Hoping for more favorable fire-fighting conditions soon. • Finally, there's this. Happy Thursday. TTYL. Many people will continue struggling to come to terms with the election results, but there’s still a lot you can do:1) Be irritable at work2) Withdraw from people who love you/need you3) Make an impulsive and self destructive major life decision Taylor Griggs is Portland Mercury's news reporter.

Title: What’s really behind Big Tech’s return-to-office mandates?
URL: https://www.theverge.com/24290345/return-to-office-mandates-amazon-productivity-remote-work-hybrid-decoder-podcast
Time Published: 2024-11-07T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. On this week’s episode of Decoder, we’re talking about work. Specifically, where we work, how our expectations of working remotely were radically changed by the covid-19 pandemic, and how those expectations feel like they’re on the verge of changing yet again. For many people, the pendulum has swung wildly between working fully remote and now a push to return to the office from their bosses, and there are a lot of theories about what might be motivating big companies to try and bring everyone back. Here on Decoder, I’ve talked to lots of CEOs about the benefits of working fully remote versus hybrid or having everybody back in the office over the past several years, and I’ve heard the full spectrum of responses. Some executives are adamant that people need to be in the office, and others are equally adamant that fully remote is the way to go. We’ll play some of those answers for you as we go so you can get a sense of the enormous range of opinions here. If you look at the surveys, it’s basically 50/50 — quite a lot of people want to work remotely, and they can be pretty loud online. But there are a lot of people, who are often quieter, who want to go back to the office for pretty good reasons. Some folks just don’t have the space to work from home, or they’re simply tired of making video calls in sweatpants all day and never really leaving the house. I know some people who really like just being able to leave work at the office when they head home for the day, and I’ve heard from a lot of younger people who are struggling to get face time with the more senior and experienced people at their companies in order to build relationships and grow their networks. The messy middle of all this is what quite a few companies have settled on: hybrid work, which allows for a combination of in-office and remote work. This is how The Verge runs, and I quite like it — but it’s not perfect. Like so many people who work in a hybrid environment, there are days where I go into a mostly empty office and then sit on Zoom in a phone booth, and there are days when I realize I’m the only one in a meeting sitting at home because everyone else has gone into the office. Figuring out how to make hybrid work is a long-term cultural project that we really only started in 2020. While there are some obvious benefits, it’s not clear if anyone’s really cracked it in a way that scales across different kinds of companies. Now, some companies have decided the nuance just isn’t worth it. In September, Amazon mandated that all employees would return to an office five days a week starting in January. In the memo announcing the change, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the company had “observed that it’s easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” that “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective,” and that “teams tend to be better connected to one another” when everyone is in the office. Amazon isn’t alone in wanting employees back at their desks. Companies like Disney and Salesforce have also pushed for employees to come back to the office at least four days a week, making similar arguments. Other companies, like Apple, have been steadily pressuring workers to come back for quite some time — that beautiful new spaceship office in Cupertino wasn’t built to stay empty. But is the return to office really about building company culture and being more creative and productive? I have to tell you, there is a huge chunk of The Verge and Decoder audience that is absolutely convinced that any big return-to-office policy change is actually just a layoff in disguise — we get emails making this case virtually every time one of these moves is announced. Jassy even addressed this directly, just a few days ago, in an all-hands meeting. Responding to claims that the return-to-work mandate is a quote “backdoor layoff,” he told employees that that is simply not true. We’ll come back to that later on. So I wanted to know what’s been going on, what the real reasons behind return-to-office might be, and where this is all headed next. To explain it, I caught up with two experts on the subject: Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School, and Jessica Kriegel, the chief strategy officer at workplace culture consultancy Culture Partners. We dive into what’s been happening to the nature of work today, and you’ll hear both of them lay out some of the key reasons behind the return-to-office push. We also try to figure out whether Amazon is just an outlier or, as you’ll hear Jessica say, “the tip of the spear” in what could be something much bigger. Here are some of the news stories, surveys, and studies we discussed in this episode, if you’d like to learn more: / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: In leaked internal meeting, Amazon retail chief says sales of cheaper items are surging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-seeing-surge-sales-cheaper-items-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-07T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
The sales of cheaper items are surging on Amazon. During a recent internal all-hands meeting, Amazon's retail CEO Doug Herrington said that the everyday essentials business, which includes health, beauty, and grocery products, is "growing 50% faster than the rest of the store," according to a recording of the event obtained by Business Insider. The growth is primarily driven by faster delivery speeds because people tend to spend more and shop more frequently when orders arrive quickly, Herrington said. Over 50% of those everyday essentials are now delivered on the same or next day, he added. "It has really supercharged our grocery and everyday essential business," Herrington said, referring to faster shipping speeds. "And these are especially the low-priced everyday essentials, the things that most households purchase every week." Amazon has been investing heavily to make its warehouse and logistics network more regional. The goal has been to not only speed up deliveries, but also make it less expensive for the company to offer faster delivery. Lower costs help Amazon offer cheaper products, which often come with thinner profit margins. This is a notable shift from the company's previous strategy of curbing sales of such products. Internally, Amazon used to refer to these products as "CRaP," or "can't realize a profit," because they were relatively expensive to ship and less profitable. Amazon's record profits in recent years, alongside drastic cost cuts and major layoffs, are also contributing to the new approach. The change can potentially help Amazon better compete against Chinese e-commerce upstarts Temu and Shein, which are rapidly growing on the back of cheap items. Shein, for example, is expanding to sell more daily essentials, like toothpaste, skincare, and toys, Reuters reported. Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment. During the recent all-hands meeting, Herrington said Amazon deliveries have become faster and cheaper after the company redesigned its network of warehouses to serve smaller regions. Now, Amazon has more warehouses assigned to customers close by, which allows for faster order fulfillment. As a result, Amazon has been able to reduce the "cost to serve" each order for two years in a row, while achieving the fastest delivery speeds for Prime shipments this year, Herrington added. "We call that effort perfect placement," Herrington said. In October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company has been "maniacal" about lowering the cost to serve in recent years. It's a real competitive advantage because now Amazon can afford to sell lower-priced items economically, he said. "There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices," Jassy said during a call with analysts. During last month's analyst call, Jassy added that the growth of cheaper items is a "real positive" because it is predicated on faster delivery speeds. He said that this usually leads to growth in customer loyalty, order frequency, and purchase volume. "We see the ability to unlock whole new elements of the consumer spend," Jassy said. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, added that strong growth in everyday essentials is a positive sign of Amazon becoming a part of consumers' daily shopping habits. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a recent note that the shift is important for Amazon, especially since its most loyal Prime membership base is growing at a slower pace. "While the growth in those categories represents a negative mix shift in terms of margins, it increases shopper loyalty, shopping frequency and increases the basket size — important if the total Prime HH membership base in the US is maturing," Mahaney wrote. Amazon is doubling down on these efforts. Herrington said in the recent all-hands meeting that Amazon is investing in new warehouse robotics technology that can further improve packaging speed. It's also expanding its rural area network and drone delivery service, he said. "The most important part is that customers are loving our faster speeds and we know they're loving it because they're shopping more," Herrington said. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: Recent tech layoffs reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths

The year 2024 has been brutal for tech workers. What started as a trickle of downsizing in 2022 has now turned into a full-blown wave of layoffs that shows no signs of stopping. From Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv and across Europe’s biggest tech hubs, tens of thousands of workers are being let go as companies scramble to stay profitable in the face of economic uncertainty, rising costs, and a rapid shift toward automation.Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments from engineering to customer service and even key areas such as AI. Intel, facing intense competition and delays in product development, has slashed 15,000 jobs and recently announced an additional 2,200 cuts in the United States, with more layoffs expected in Israel. Similarly, Tesla, grappling with surging material costs, cut 14,000 employees as part of its operational tightening. Meanwhile, in a shocking move, Google laid off 12,000 workers, ruthlessly eliminating entire teams overnight as it restructures and pivots toward AI-driven initiatives.The message from these corporations is clear: In the world’s most profitable industry, if the bottom line is threatened, no role is safe. While the numbers paint a bleak picture, the real story is how different regions deal with the fallout. Layoffs in the US, Israel, and Europe reflect their unique business cultures, legal frameworks, and societal values, creating wildly different experiences for employees caught in the crossfire.In the US, tech layoffs are fast, sharp, and often brutal. With at-will employment laws giving companies the flexibility to cut staff quickly, American tech giants have embraced this “slash and burn” strategy. Google’s mass firing of 12,000 employees was carried out with cold efficiency, leaving workers with little notice and little room for negotiation. Meta, which laid off 21,000 workers across several rounds in 2023, also epitomized this approach. Employees were notified via email, and, in many cases, their access to systems was immediately revoked, creating an atmosphere of sudden shock and panic. The focus here is always on the bottom line, with efficiency reigning supreme over personal impact​. IN JANUARY, Bill Ackman and his wife Neri Oxman bought 4.9% of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for $25 million in a move that signaled confidence in the Israeli economy. The writer asks: What if similarly influential businesspeople set aside a cumulative investment of $1 billion in Israeli tech startup (credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Yet, this approach has come under fire for its harshness. As these companies tighten operations and invest more heavily in AI and automation, the human cost of rapid layoffs is often overlooked, sparking anger and frustration among workers who feel disposable.What are tech layoffs like in Israel and around the world?IN ISRAEL, layoffs cut deeper. Israeli workplace culture is highly relational, with close bonds between employees and managers. This makes layoffs not just a business decision but a personal loss. Mobileye, one of Israel’s leading tech firms, slashed 200 jobs in 2023, causing a ripple of emotional fallout throughout the company.​ Managers held direct face-to-face conversations with workers, and the news often broke in company forums rather than sterile HR emails. These decisions felt heavier, with employees expressing a sense of betrayal.In Israel, companies often go to great lengths to cushion the blow. Extended notice periods, severance packages, and assistance finding new employment are more common, reflecting a broader cultural value of solidarity in difficult times.In many ways, Europe’s response to layoffs is the most dramatic. Strong labor laws, unions, and a deep cultural commitment to workers’ rights mean that job cuts aren’t just handed down; they are fought. When Orange announced layoffs in France in 2024, it led to street protests and protracted negotiations with unions, demanding fair compensation and alternatives such as voluntary departures.​ French labor law, designed to protect workers from sudden terminations, forced the company into lengthy discussions, often delaying the process for months. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Meanwhile, SAP found itself embroiled in a standoff with unions after announcing job cuts in Germany. German law requires extensive consultation with employees and unions before mass layoffs occur, creating a slow, bureaucratic process. In some cases, tensions rose so high that SAP executives faced heckling and protests from disgruntled employees, forcing the company to navigate legal and social challenges simultaneously.The US approach, marked by ruthless efficiency, contrasts sharply with Europe’s protective laws and Israel’s emotionally charged downsizing. In America, layoffs are seen as a necessary evil to maintain business health, even if it means throwing workers into uncertainty with little notice. In Israel, the process is more personal but equally painful, tearing apart tight-knit communities that view their workplace as an extension of family. Conversely, Europe takes a combative stance, with workers protected by legal frameworks and unions, leading to public backlash and prolonged negotiations.The tech layoffs of 2024 reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths. As companies worldwide pivot towards AI, automation, and cost-cutting strategies, how they handle the human cost of these decisions reveals as much about their values as their balance sheets.

In the US, tech layoffs are fast, sharp, and often brutal. With at-will employment laws giving companies the flexibility to cut staff quickly, American tech giants have embraced this “slash and burn” strategy. Google’s mass firing of 12,000 employees was carried out with cold efficiency, leaving workers with little notice and little room for negotiation. Meta, which laid off 21,000 workers across several rounds in 2023, also epitomized this approach. Employees were notified via email, and, in many cases, their access to systems was immediately revoked, creating an atmosphere of sudden shock and panic. The focus here is always on the bottom line, with efficiency reigning supreme over personal impact​.

Title: Will New Trump Administration Set Off Merger Fever In Hollywood?

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Among the outgrowths of Donald Trump’s presidential victory is an expected shift in antitrust and other regulatory interventions, well timed for battered Hollywood studios hoping to restructure for a post-Streaming Wars era. In case you missed it, Netflix won those Streaming Wars, perhaps more emphatically than anything in the political sphere this year. Financially strained studios have cut thousands of jobs, killed off projects, reduced new program orders, sold off pieces to private equity, and otherwise pondered what next if they’re to survive and thrive. As MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note: “The battle caused a lot of damage to traditional media and Netflix has emerged as the clear victor.” Studio chiefs have mused in various public settings about joint ventures, partnerships, and outright mergers and acquisitions as a way to better compete against Netflix and the video operations of tech titans Apple, Alphabet and Amazon. Now, with changes afoot at what has been a reflexively anti-merger Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, media moguls may again get to mogul-ing, instead of bemoaning their fates while leaving many others unemployed. The latest trial balloon came during last week’s Comcast earnings call, when President Robert Cavanagh surprised listeners, saying the company is considering spinning off or otherwise removing its cable operations from Comcast’s complicated corporate structure, while holding on to both the NBC broadcast network and loss-making, under-sized streaming service Peacock. “We are now exploring,” Cavanagh said, “whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and composed of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders.” Macquarie senior media-tech analyst Tim Nollen wrote that a cable spinoff likely would help Comcast’s shares and core media assets, but questioned who would invest in a troubled, declining sector, especially if the assets are stripped of the cross-platform synergies possible now. For instance, the all-news MSNBC and all-business-news CNBC share many assets with NBC News. How would they disentangle, and what would be left of value? “(Comcast’s) NBCU(niversal) has been deemphasizing cable nets for some time, exiting regional sports and putting content on Peacock; new NBA rights were won thanks to broadcast and Peacock - not cable, as Warner Bros Discovery found out,” Nollen wrote. “We question how valuable cable networks would be stand-alone, without ties to NBCU's studio and streaming capability, and lacking advertising tie-ins; industry M&A/JVs appear possible.” The cable spinoff is just one possible deal that likely will be more feasible under a Trump regime with a more wave-it-through approach. But it won’t be the only one. For instance, private equity giant TPG is trying to do two deals in one: take over AT&T’s minority share of DirecTV and merge it with competitor DISH Networks. Given the struggles vexing both satellite TV providers, and DISH’s particularly perilous finances, even Biden/Harris regulators were expected to probably approve the merger, much as happened in 2008 with the Sirius and XM satellite radio services. The biggest challenge there might be DISH bondholders who don’t want to take a haircut on their notes. Shari Redstone has agreed to sell her stake in Paramount Global to a consortium led by Skydance founder David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely also would have been approved regardless, but the elder Ellison’s close relationship with Trump may speed things along. And given the uncertainties around Paramount’s clutch of cable networks, it may simplify some of the restructuring both Paramount’s current management and Ellison may have in mind. But lots of clues suggest far more dealmaking across the industry is in the offing. What might that look like? To begin with, MoffettNathanson’s Fishman attempted to quantify what a major modern media company (to paraphrase Gilbert & Sullivan) might look like. “Companies for whom video is a core part of the business trade at significant discounts, with Netflix’s enterprise value now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined!” wrote Fishman in a research note released last week. “Where does that leave the rest of the field? What does each player bring to the table, and how might a bit of strategic M&A augment their position?” It’s increasingly clear what assets those reshaped media companies would need to compete as the industry enters the second half of the 2020s, Fishman wrote. “We see these assets as: a scaled streaming service (both in the U.S. and globally), a free AVOD platform, top-tier sports rights, a U.S. broadcast network, and film and television studios,” Fishman wrote. Broadcast has the broadest reach, and as cable viewership fades, “Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners...Sports drive viewership, subscriptions and advertising dollars,” Fishman wrote. Disney remains the combined leader in overall viewership most months across all platforms, though YouTube with its vast supply of user-generated content sometimes grabs the mantle, according to Nielsen statistics released at the recent Advertising Research Foundation’s OTT conference. That cross-platform approach suggests there’s still power even in older distribution platforms when it’s intelligently harnessed and cross-promoted. “As for non-sports viewing, free AVOD / FAST channel platforms bring reach and inventory that can supplement ad sales across a portfolio,” Fishman wrote. “AVOD is the basic cable networks of the streaming age. These platforms now provide an avenue for monetizing older content for companies with large catalogues.” There are some combinations of existing media companies that might fill respective holes on each side, and would make sense as the companies try to scale up against Netflix and the Titans. Fox, for instance, has hugely popular AVOD platform Tubi and a broadcast network with strong sports rights in the NFL and other major sports, even after it sold off most film and TV studio assets to Disney in 2019. Warner Bros. Discovery, by contrast, has highly regarded film and TV production studios, the increasingly global Max streaming service with more than 100 million subscribers, and its own batch of sports rights (though it loses the NBA after this season). That’s why, Fishman wrote, “When thinking about the next potential media deal, we continue to see a marriage of Fox and WBD’s assets as the most natural fit, especially when considering how it would fill WBD’s current need for top-tier sports rights and grant it ownership of a big four U.S. broadcast network.” Less likely, perhaps, is any imminent deal affecting Trump’s sometimes-favorite all-news cable service, Fox News Channel, even as the business around it is shrinking. Though Fox News has long had cable TV’s oldest average viewership, it remains the most-watched, certainly among the three all-news competitors. But what would a Fox merger mean for CNN Worldwide, which is part of WBD? CNN’s cable network is habitually third in ratings these days, even as Chairman and CEO Mark Thompson continues to build up a thriving online side. The service tacked to the political center after the Warner Bros. Discovery merger 2.5 years ago, but still enrages Trump routinely. Is CNN headed to a private-equity spinoff or the sort of billionaire side project that has kept afloat (sometimes with plenty of controversy) such outlets as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Time, and The Atlantic? It’s even possible, Fishman wrote, that as Netflix continues to build out its ad-supported operations (still less than three years old), it may consider either launching or acquiring its own AVOD platform to go with its premium, first-run subscription shows. “We would not be surprised to see Netflix explore either launching their own FAST service or even acquiring an AVOD platform as advertising becomes a more meaningful driver of its revenue in the years ahead,” Fishman wrote. During the ARF’s OTT Conference, Nielsen’s SVP, Product Strategy & Thought Leadership Brian Fuhrer suggested that one underreported story is how well some media companies are integrating and cross-promoting programming across streaming, broadcast and cable. “A lot of people said you're giving too much of an advantage by zeroing in on streamers,” Fuhrer said in recounting the challenges Nielsen has had capturing viewership in its The Gauge reports. “For companies with assets in multiple categories, (critics said) you’re not showing how they stack up.” Indeed, over the summer, with children out of school and football out of season, four different media companies took turns at No. 1 in total viewership, most notably NBCUniversal and Peacock, which dominated August with record viewing of the Summer Olympics in Paris, and shifted its share of viewership by 4.9 points. “It's really pretty extraordinary,” Fuhrer said. “We'll be looking back on these Olympics as a use case for a long time to come. They really leaned into every asset they had and connected it to consumers. The ability to meet people where they are, in categories they want to use, that's one of the things people have under-appreciated. There's a halo effect back and forth. I think this is an underappreciated opportunity to understand what’s working here.” Streaming has become the way most viewers under 35 are watching “TV,” Fuhrer said. Streaming comprises about 80 percent of their view time, especially when gaming is removed from the analysis. Older audiences split their viewership more evenly across cable, broadcast and streaming. That analysis leaves out streaming-only Netflix and Youtube, as well as Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video. They’re doing just fine without those legacy linear operations, it would appear. But there’s hope, Fuhrer suggested, for the traditional media companies in Hollywood to do far better than they have. Broadcasting makes up about 22.6 percent of view time in the United States, while cable still attracts another 26.1 percent. Together, that’s less than half of viewtime these days, but still notable. What’s more remarkable, Fuhrer said, is the patterns that remain intact in peak viewing across platforms. The biggest viewership still happens on Super Bowl Sunday, New Year’s Eve and Thanksgiving. Football drives a lot of that. A Thursday Night Football game on Amazon Prime will generate between 2.3 billion and 2.9 billion live streaming minutes, Fuhrer said. He compared that to Netflix’s most watched series in September, The Perfect Couple, with about 500 million streaming minutes. “Football is really impactful and really different,” Fuhrer said. But what he called “The Netflix Effect” is expanding. By that, he was referring to the vast new audience Netflix generated when it licensed NBCUniversal’s decade-old cable hit Suits. Now other media companies are figuring out how to promote shows across all their distribution platforms. “Cross-platform promotion to reach non-viewers can work in both directions, linear to streaming and streaming to linear,” Fuhrer said. “The Netflix Effect isn't limited to Netflix anymore. The ability to promote streaming content to linear audiences, that's a valuable commodity and I think is under-appreciated.” While there’s hope here for a way out of the morass facing traditional studios, there’s still plenty of griping, as suggested by Needham & Co. Senior Analyst Laura Martin, based on a dinner she had with a group of senior Hollywood executives. Among the gripes, she wrote: “Streaming is a lousy business, compared with the linear TV bundle. Not only does it typically have only one (revenue) stream instead of two, but streaming's ad loads are well below linear TV, and its total (advertising revenues) are relatively small (typically around 10% of linear TV). Also, churn is MUCH higher for streaming than linear TV, where 2-3 year agreements were the norm. The transition from linear to streaming has been a material downdraft for economics for the traditional media companies, with no end in sight, they all agreed.” Not everything Netflix touches turns to gold, of course. The company’s new film chief, Dan Lin, is the latest to propose making fewer but better films, in contrast to predecessor Scott Stuber’s “stuff-the-pipeline” approach, epitomized by a post-pandemic plan to produce an eye-popping 70 films per year. That led to plenty of criticism about underdeveloped or copycat projects, perhaps inevitable with such an ambitious slate. Lin also is hoping to be more targeted in how Netflix spends its money, throwing fewer wads of upfront cash at big names while perhaps, perhaps, shifting away from its standard approach, and giving at least some talent a chance to share in the back-end profits of successful projects. Netflix is also reducing at least some ambitions on the game side, where it recently shut down a development studio focused on a AAA title. Netflix is hardly the only media company having game-industry headaches, with layoffs the past year affecting pretty much every major publisher. But it’s another area where the largess of the pandemic era and recovery has been significantly pulled back, and new priorities set. All of which suggests that even the victor in the Streaming Wars may still have some work to do to get ready for the next era of media in Hollywood.

Title: Lilbits: EU probes Corning Gorilla Glass for antitrust violations, Android TV and Google TV hardware requirement updates, and Mozilla Foundation layoffs

Google is lowering the minimum amount of memory required for new Android TV devices… but increasing the amount needed for Google TV. The Mozilla Foundation is laying off a significant portion of its team. Microsoft plans to launch a preview of its controversial Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs by December. And the European Union is investigating whether Corning’s exclusivity deals with phone and tablet makers that use Gorilla Glass is a violation of antitrust rules. Here’s a roundup of recent tech news from around the web. Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used to offer protection for many, many phones and tablets. The EU wants to know if the exclusivity deals Corning has signed with device makers has made it difficult for rivals to compete in this space. Google has lowered the minimum amount of RAM needed for Android TV devices from 1.5 GB to 1GB, which should enable hardware makers to produce cheaper products. But Google TV (which is built on Android TV) requires 2GB (which is more than the latest Chromecast with Google TV HD has). The non-profit foundation behind the Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client is eliminating two divisions as part of the layoffs: advocacy for “privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies” and global programs.

Intel Lunar Lake chips feature on-package LPDDR5x-8533 memory which saves space and reduces latency and power consumption. But it also drives up the price, so Intel says it’s a one-off.

Title: Amazon’s Andy Jassy denies its 5-day-a-week RTO plan is a secret way to reduce headcount

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is demanding employees come into the office five days a week, but it’s not because he secretly wants them to quit, he said. Jassy announced the company’s strict return-to-office mandate in a September memo, sparking immediate outrage from employees, some of which had been working at least two days remotely per week since May 2023. Some experts have theorized that Jassy’s RTO plan could be a sneaky way of reducing the company’s headcount, rather than go through the formal process of conducting layoffs. Yet, in an all-hands meeting Tuesday, Jassy denied claims that the RTO plan was a “backdoor layoff” or that the company had reached some agreement with city leaders. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said, according to a transcript reported by Reuters. Following the September RTO announcement, 73% of employees surveyed by anonymous job review site Blind said they had considered quitting in light of the new policy. Other employees quickly took to LinkedIn to change their status to #opentowork in hopes of finding a more flexible position. But in the company’s Amazon Web Services unit, CEO Matt Garman was clear that the naysayers could go elsewhere. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said on an internal call last month, referencing the company’s RTO policy, Reuters reported. To make clear their frustration with the RTO policy, hundreds of AWS employees signed a letter last month protesting the change, calling it an “outright abdication” of AWS’s role as an innovator and industry leader. To be sure, Amazon has offered employees commuter benefits and subsidized parking, among other perks to help ease the transition. In the memo from September, Jassy said it’s easier for employees to learn and collaborate while in person. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Amazon told Fortune the RTO plan is meant to strengthen the company’s culture and ensure teams are connected. The RTO memo asked workers to go back to “the way we were before the onset of COVID,” and banned working from home except for extraordinary circumstances. Jassy pointed out in the memo that intense coding work or having a sick child were appropriate times to work from home with manager consent. While managers earlier this year received approval to fire employees who didn’t comply with the previous three-day in-office mandate, many still made changes to their lives based on Amazon’s flexibility. In the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Jasssy acknowledged the five-day RTO policy, which takes effect in January, would take some getting used to. “It is an adjustment. I understand that for a lot of people, and we’re going to be working through that adjustment together,” Jassy said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon CEO denies forced return to office move is "backdoor layoff"

Amazon is pushing ahead with its RTO policy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Not long after hundreds of Amazon workers signed a petition against the company’s proposed five-day return-to-office policy, company CEO Andy Jassy has denied claims the mandate was introduced to quietly push workers away. At a recent all-hands meeting (via CNBC), Jassy rejected claims the RTO policy is a “backdoor layoff,” adding the push for in-person working would reinforce Amazon’s culture. The news comes after a September 2024 announcement detailing the new full-time RTO plans, set to be enacted from January 2, 2025. “A number of people I’ve seen theorize that the reason we were doing this is a backdoor layoff or we made some sort of deal with the city, or cities, and that’s why we were having people come back and be together more often," Jassy declared. The reaction from Amazon workers is understandable, given the company has laid off around 27,000 workers since tech redundancies skyrocketed in 2022. Signed by around 500 workers, the recent petition against the company’s RTO mandate alleged that AWS CEO Matt Garman’s claims many workers were on board with the change were incorrect. Prior to that, Garman also reportedly told workers unhappy with the change to consider leaving the company altogether. Up from the current three-day policy, the change to full-time office hours marks a significant shift in the tech sector. Many of Amazon’s rivals are still working on three-day mandates.
