This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, the global advertising conglomerate WPP started to slash almost one-third of its New York office space. Different WPP agencies maintained separate Manhattan headquarters: Ogilvy was on 11th Avenue, Grey on lower Fifth, VML in Columbus Circle. But those buildings were all empty, and there was no telling when or if the thousands of employees who had once worked in them would return. WPP’s corporate leadership had long been trying to break down the walls between its subsidiaries by putting them together on corporate campuses, and a five-year strategic plan, developed with the consultants at McKinsey & Company and announced in late 2020, estimated it could reduce its global real-estate costs by consolidating offices. “COVID really supports the space agenda we’ve had for years,” the executive who then managed WPP’s American real estate told a New York trade publication in December 2020. “People don’t need a desk just to put pictures on it.” Remote work appeared, at first, to be that rare thing in corporate America: an efficiency measure that made both management and employees happy. Mark Read, WPP’s chief executive, says it “amazed everybody” to discover the business of advertising could be done from home. Based on preliminary evidence, both sides made permanent decisions. Some workers bought houses far outside the city, or left the New York area completely. WPP gradually moved most of its New York agencies into an airy “vertical campus” occupying 13 stories in 3 World Trade Center, which it had originally opened in 2018 as a headquarters for two of its firms. They would all have less space but more flexibility. The company’s “hybrid work” policy gave employees latitude to come in rarely, or not at all. By last year, though, Read says he came to believe that remote work was no longer working. “I just don’t believe you can do our job on the end of a video screen,” Read says. “I think people’s attention wanes, and they’re not fully present.” When he visited WPP’s offices around the world, he perceived that “those offices that were doing best were also those offices that were the busiest.” When he examined the data, he says he saw that in-person attendance appeared to correlate with employee satisfaction, as measured by internal survey results, and also financial performance. But attendance varied across the more than 100 companies that WPP owns. “The challenge was that without a mandate, it was very hard,” Read says. “People weren’t coming in, and if people weren’t coming in, people didn’t see the benefit of being together.” Read’s realization came at a moment of atmospheric change in office culture. For the first few years after the pandemic, a period of fast economic recovery and labor scarcity, workers had leverage to demand a great deal from their employers. Companies pledged to respect work-life balance, personal growth, and mental wellness, and offered perks like online meditation sessions. They also liberated workers from the bonds of the office. Some bosses embraced remote work wholeheartedly as a transformational (and economical) change; others allowed it grudgingly, issuing unenforced attendance guidelines and turning a blind eye to Zoom backgrounds. Across sectors, though, CEOs are now getting tough and reclaiming their authority by imposing mandatory return-to-office policies. At WPP, the summons came down in a January memo entitled “Winning Together,” in which Read extolled the intangible benefits of “human connection, creativity, and relationships,” before laying down the new law to his more than 100,000 employees worldwide: Come in at least four days a week, starting in April. “The initial response was quite polarizing,” Read says, with considerable understatement. Decrying the “mental and social effects” of “rigid work regimes,” a group of WPP employees started an online petition, which has collected more than 20,000 signatures. “I’ve yet to speak to a single colleague who is happy with the four-day return-to-office,” one executive told the marketing industry website the Drum. Another said: “It has left us reeling.” A similar dynamic has played out in workplaces across New York City: at banks, at media organizations, and even at formerly footloose tech firms. In January, JP Morgan and Amazon announced or implemented five-day return-to-office policies, putting an end to the remote-work experiment. The law firm Sullivan & Cromwell reportedly instructed its associates to be in the office from at least 9:30 to 5:30, Monday through Friday. Companies large and small have been quietly upping the number of days they require their employees to be in — a phenomenon known as “RTO creep.” RTO creep is reflected in a variety of statistical measures of the city’s business — and busyness. The Real Estate Board of New York’s monthly office-visitation report, which draws on mobile-device tracking data, hit a post-pandemic high last December, surpassing 80 percent of what it was in 2019 if you exclude the final holiday week. New Jersey Transit reports that its regional rail-system ridership is about 75 percent of what it was before COVID, with peak midweek trains carrying as many passengers as before. The MTA’s commuter trains report comparable ridership figures. For the past few months, office leasing activity has been as consistently strong as New York has seen since the pandemic-era commercial real-estate crash. Beyond the numbers, you can see evidence of RTO creep in the desultory line at the salad bar, the quiet that has descended on the gym on a Monday morning, and an uptick in desperate group-chat pleas for after-school carpools. Office work is not all the way back to what it once was, but the trend is moving in one direction with disorienting speed, without much regard for life or balance. The most extreme return-to-office mandates can, in some cases, leave employees with less permission to work from home than they enjoyed before the pandemic. Tonally, if the first half of the 2020s brought out the human side of human resources, the back end may belong to Elon Musk, the billionaire and return-to-office zealot who has used mandates as a blunt instrument to purge workforces, first at Twitter and now within the federal bureaucracy. C-suite executives, unleashing their inner Elons, are feeling emboldened to bark: Get back to work! And they are sending messages that they really mean it this time, letting their employees know they are keeping track of turnstile badge swipes and using other surveillance measures to track compliance. Workers can complain — and they do, loudly — but the hard truth is, they have little room to resist the reversal. Now that the job market has cooled and a recession is looming, power has shifted back to employers, who are showing who’s boss. Like all utopian experiments, work-from-anywhere was never as universally beneficial as advertised. The phenomenon was terrible for New York City, which lost tax revenue, small businesses, and tens of thousands of residents it has yet to recover. Many of the city’s top executives were quick to return to work in person after the lockdown, and were confronted each day with the sight of many empty desks. “We have a lot of space,” says Brad Karp, the chair of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which rents 675,000 square feet in a skyscraper on Sixth Avenue and resisted incentives to downsize. “When it was unoccupied during COVID, it was very, very jarring.” In February, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, gave voice to the long-festering frustration of many of his peers. At a company town hall at a satellite office in Ohio, a JP Morgan IT worker asked Dimon if he might allow managers some flexibility to make exceptions to his new five-day office mandate. “I’m going to give you a complete answer,” Dimon replied. “There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance. The abuse that took place was extraordinary.” Then Dimon let loose a profane rant. “We also had — and you know I’m right about this one — a lot of you were on the fucking Zoom and you were doing the following: looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff, and if you don’t think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness — it does.” Dimon railed against unofficial three-day weekends — “I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there’s not a goddamn person you can get ahold of” — and said that anyone who disagreed with his new policy could find other employment. “You don’t have to work at JPMorgan,” Dimon said. “It’s a free country, you can walk with your feet. But this company is going to set our own standards and do it our own way. I’ve had it with this kind of stuff. I’ve been working seven days a goddamn week since COVID, and I come in, and — where is everybody else?” Audio of Dimon’s tirade went viral, inspiring a predictable uproar on social media and secret delight among the many bosses who shared his cynical assumptions about what their subordinates really were up to on their remote days. David Solomon, Dimon’s counterpart at Goldman Sachs, liked to tell the story of the time he ran into a group of junior bankers lunching at a Hamptons restaurant one COVID summer workday, at a time when Goldman’s offices were mostly closed for social distancing. Goldman was one of the first New York companies to summon employees back in 2021, overriding work-life balance complaints from its younger employees. Even a notoriously demanding boss like Solomon, however, has run into problems enforcing his mandate, forcing the bank to periodically circulate unfriendly reminders to its staff. It’s a common issue: A 2024 office-tenant survey by the commercial real-estate firm CBRE found that only 17 percent of organizations have a policy that they actively enforce. Inconsistency in both expectations and compliance has created an uneven state of affairs in New York. Firms in some industries, like finance and real estate, issued RTO edicts years ago, and are now more or less back to their pre-pandemic routines. (Even before Dimon’s mandate, around 70 percent of JP Morgan employees were coming in five days.) In the realm of big law, attitudes surrounding office work were slower to revert and still vary from firm to firm, in part because they were run by committees of partners, some of whom have very much enjoyed their independence. (A recent survey of more than 1,000 law firm partners conducted by the BTI Consulting Group found that 50 percent were adamantly opposed to return-to-office mandates.) Creative sectors that embraced the work-from-anywhere ethos, like software design, media, and advertising, have been slowest to junk the hybrid model. Some in this realm, like the book publisher Random House and Vox Media — this publication’s parent company — still have no uniform company-wide attendance requirement. But increasingly, they are outliers. The Atlantic told its staff in January that they would soon be required to be in the office three days a week. The magazine company Condé Nast imposed a four-day office mandate that took effect earlier this month. The Washington Post has ordered its reporters to be back in the newsroom five days a week in June. Remote workers will often say they find they get more done at home. “I don’t think personal productivity is the only metric of success in our business,” Read replies. “How many emails you answer, how many Teams calls you do — business is more than that. It is also mentoring, training, coaching, motivating, and all those things are much easier to do, and in some cases you can only do them, if you are together.” Managers are also aware that some percentage of their employees abused their lack of supervision. Some took on side gigs. Some just checked out. Ironically, autonomy also seemed to make workers more discontented. Vanessa Akhtar, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter who specializes in workplace performance, says that many companies have been alarmed to see scores on their internal workplace engagement surveys plummet, with respondents indicating they are isolated and mistrustful of leadership. Forcing employees to return to offices, she says, “is one way to almost coerce personal engagement.” “I believe it is nearly impossible to develop a culture remotely,” says Karp, who announced a four-day-a-week policy for Paul Weiss in early March. Other big law firms — Skadden, Weil Gotshal, Davis Polk, Vinson & Elkins — have implemented similar four-day mandates, and each time it’s happened, the industry website Above the Law has published a post in which anonymous tipsters bitch about the decision. “Associates are furious, many are looking into quitting,” one source at Sullivan & Cromwell told the blog after news leaked on Reddit that the firm was now requiring junior attorneys to be in five days a week, absent extraordinary circumstances. But Karp says that, in the case of Paul Weiss, his push to return to an office was supported by a committee of the firm’s associates, who recognized that interaction with their superiors created more opportunities for mentorship and advancement. For that to occur, senior people also have to be present. “It really only works effectively if the partners are there,” Karp says. And that is why a universal mandate was necessary. In the first years after the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggested there was a generational gap in attitudes about the necessity of the office, with younger workers taking the fullest advantage of the freedom of remote work. If anything, employers now say, that dynamic has reversed. Zoomers who had little previous experience of the office have realized it is easier to be recognized for your work if your boss recognizes your face. “It was clear that the people who weren’t coming in were not advancing,” says the managing partner of a large New York architecture firm. “As promotions came through, I think they saw that the people who were there were more successful.” Now the people who are more resistant to recalibrating their routines, in this manager’s experience, were the mid-career employees. “People with smaller kids, that’s where it’s tricky.” Bosses recognize that many of their employees — particularly ones with families — rebuilt their lives around the expectation that they would be able to continue working remotely. Those who bought houses far outside the city are now looking at long daily commutes. Those who got used to being able to schedule their work around their kids’ school days and sports practices are now having to think about finding expensive child care. In prior years, they might have been able to keep telecommuting on the down-low, hoping that management wasn’t really serious, but the newest mandates have often come accompanied by a draconian message to holdouts: Conform or quit. Akhtar says that while most employers are not trying to inspire mass attrition, à la Musk, they are aware that presenting a return-to-office ultimatum may cause some employees to consider resignation. In certain circumstances, she says, they may desire such self-selecting attrition. “I’ve had employers be honest and say, ‘Yes that is part of it,’” Akhtar told me. Forcing employees to recommit to coming to work at the office on a daily basis, she says, gives management ”an opportunity to see who is onboard.” To many people who returned to the office voluntarily years ago, such demands can seem insulting. Office workers grew accustomed to thinking that they were adults who could be trusted to choose where they could perform best on any given day. When they feel like management is treating them like children, Akhtar said, they are apt to rebel. Even in typically conformist workplaces like JPMorgan and Amazon, the new mandates have inspired Slack uprisings, murmurs of unionization and disobedience. Employees in some heavy-handed companies have devised sneaky ways to work around the system, for instance by swiping into the office, getting themselves a free coffee, and heading home. (This strategy is so common that management consultants have coined a name for it: “coffee badging.”) A couple weeks ago, on Reddit, a person posting under the username No-Refrigerator7245, who said they were a New York–based WPP remote worker, asked for feedback about whether they could stay “under the radar” and avoid consequences. (A leaked WPP internal memo advised that noncompliance could result in “disciplinary action up to and including termination.”) The question sparked a vigorous discussion about corporate surveillance in the advertising industry. A commenter who said they worked at another ad company, one of WPP’s competitors, reported there was gossip that the company pinged its employees’ VPNs three times a day to confirm their locations. Another commenter noted what happened last year at Publicis, another competitor, which reportedly fired nearly 100 employees in the U.S. for “egregious” noncompliance with its three-day office policy. “Yep, they’ll fire OP in a heartbeat,” another commenter concluded, referring to the original poster. “At this point the industry is in shambles so better to suck it up and comply than to rock the boat.” The discussion took note of WPP’s disappointing recent financial performance; its stock is down by more than 25 percent since early December. Last year, at a conference on remote work held at Stanford University, a pair of business-school researchers from the University of Pittsburgh presented a paper that drew a connection between return-to-office mandates and poor financial results, finding that in the case of many companies — UPS, Amazon, Boeing, Nike — policies were toughened immediately after stock-price crashes. The professors hypothesized the outcome was consistent with management deciding to “reassert control over employees,” blaming them as “a scapegoat for bad firm performance.” It makes intuitive sense: Bosses get stressed and they punish their lazy workers. On the other hand, those bosses might reply, bad financial performance might be a sign that flexible policies are not as productive as workers may think. That was the message that Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, recently sent to the Silicon Valley engineers assigned to work on Gemini, its artificial-intelligence product. “I recommend being in the office at least every weekday,” Brin told his employees in a memo that was promptly leaked to the Times. A 60-hour work week, he suggested, was “the sweet spot of productivity.” Brin is probably not wrong to think that, as his search-engine business faces an existential competitive threat from AI start-ups, his coders ought to be working overtime. (Google’s thousands of employees in New York are only required to be in the office three days a week.) A similar catchup effort has been playing out at Rockstar Games. It called its employees back five days a week last year, Bloomberg reported, as it labored to finish the development of Grand Theft Auto VI, which has been hampered by footage leaks and delays. The fact that these mandates are coming down in the tech industry just shows how much the workplace conversation has shifted. You can’t blame workers for feeling whipsawed. Even Zoom now mandates that employees who live within 50 miles of one its offices come in at least two days a week. Last December, just before a round of layoffs, Condé Nast chief executive Roger Lynch announced a new four-day office mandate to his remaining employees. Staffers wondered: Working where? Inside Condé’s offices at One World Trade Center, unassigned “hot desks” were already in short supply. Lynch’s memo promised there would soon be “more information on space,” but satisfying explanations never came. In February, as the mandate loomed, the Condé Nast union staged an unusual labor action. Instead of striking, magazine staffers came to work simultaneously, to demonstrate how cramped they would be. “We wait in line for phone pods,” the union posted on X. “We hold meetings while Avicii blasts over the speakers & people eat sandwiches in the background of our Zooms.” An accompanying photo displayed a group of young workers, laptops open, sitting five to a booth in the cafeteria. While it did not exactly resemble a coal mine, the scene did foreshadow the unproductive discomfort that Condé’s clumsily implemented policy would inflict when it started in March. “It’s just a shitshow,” says one employee, who described a weeks-long competition for scarce desks. “Everyone is miffed, even the top brass.” The annoyance of overcrowding has been exacerbated by the unforgiving rigidity of the policy. In briefings given by human resources, managers were told that employees were required to be present Monday through Thursday. It didn’t count if you worked from home because your child had a fever, or you were getting a cough that might be something worse — you would have to take one of your ten allotted remote work days per year, or else call in sick. Working on a Friday also didn’t count toward your four-day requirement, which was maddening to employees who had to work in the office on Fridays, doing things like finishing up a magazine that has to go to the printer. Upper management let it be known that it was tracking badge swipes. A briefing slide titled “Non-Compliance With Policy,” illustrated with a stock photo of a pair of very serious looking models, indicated there were two options for dealing with truants: • Voluntary Resignation• Involuntary Separation To some employees, it all seemed very reminiscent of the chainsaw-wielding tactics of Musk. “Overall, we see the RTO push as a way to coerce members to quit without severance,” says Jess Lane, an organizer of the Condé Nast union protest. “This is another way of culling the herd.” The space constraints Condé Nast’s employees were feeling were the product of management’s previous cost-saving decisions. As the magazine business contracted, so had its office space inside One World Trade Center. Publications like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair were forced to downsize their space. At one point in 2021, Condé’s ownership stopped paying rent to its landlord in an unsuccessful attempt to spring itself from its decades-long lease in the building. The two sides settled their dispute, but Conde has continued to attempt to unload space on the sublease market. At least five of its floors that it leases are currently listed as available to sublet, according to the CoStar Group’s commercial real-estate data. Lane says that in response to the overcrowding issue, Condé Nast recently moved some workers to the building’s 27th floor, which was one of the spaces it had been trying to sublease. Many companies took an opportunistic approach to their office space during the pandemic, reducing their square footage when their leases came up for renegotiation or subleasing unused floors. Now, that tide of vacancy is starting to roll back in. According to figures from CBRE, since the beginning of last year, around 3 million square feet has been taken off the sublease market by companies that say they plan to reoccupy it. Shifting to hybrid or all-remote work policies not only saved on rent, it also allowed companies to quickly expand their workforces, because they were no longer limited by geography when it came to hiring talent. It has turned out, though, that dispersal creates its own limits. Altruist, a financial technology company founded in 2018, used a work-from-home policy to quickly staff up by hiring people all over the country, only to decide as it grew more established that it needed offices for managerial and regulatory reasons. “All we knew is that the longer we waited, the more difficult this would be,” says Katherine Starros, the company’s head of human resources. In 2023, after health concerns related to COVID relaxed, it told its employees they would have to work in an office in Dallas or Los Angeles, and gave them around six months to relocate within commuting distance, if necessary. Starros said 13 percent of its 250 employees quit, a little less than the opt-out rate the company expected. Altruist has since filled all those positions and more. It is expanding its two offices and has opened an outpost in San Francisco. A New York location is also in the works. “We are really excited about our first ever real internship program this summer,” Starros said. In some cases, corporate decisions made based on the presumption of continuing low office attendance have had expensive consequences. During the pandemic, some New York office tenants decided to make an upgrade in quality, vacating their old buildings when their leases expired and taking smaller but pricier office space in new construction in developments like One Vanderbilt or at Hudson Yards. “Some companies that did that transaction — less space, higher rent — thought they could shimmy down,” says Peter Turchin, a commercial broker at the firm CBRE. “And then they ended up needing more space.” As workers return, companies have had to squeeze in or rent more space. Turchin said that happened to IBM, which in 2022 decided to consolidate its multiple New York office locations in a new building at One Madison Avenue. In January, just a few months after it moved into the completed building, it signed a lease for an additional 93,000 square feet. (An IBM spokesperson said the recent lease decision was “in no way a result of not having enough space for employees currently.”) Last year, Amazon announced it would soon begin requiring full-time attendance from all of its 350,000 corporate employees. “If it’s not for you, then that’s okay. You can go and find another company if you want to,” an unsympathetic Amazon executive said at an industry conference as the company rolled out the corporate decision. Then the unforgiving policy ran up against the laws of physics. When it took effect nationwide, in January, it turned out there were not enough desks, chairs, and parking spaces to go around, creating chaos and embarrassing headlines for corporate America’s supposed logistics experts. In New York, Amazon has been rushing to find additional office space beyond what it has inside its new hub in the Lord & Taylor building, signing leases in three other buildings in the last few months. One of those new Amazon leases, completed just this month, is at 237 Park Avenue, where it is reportedly taking over a 193,000 square foot space that was put on the sublease market in 2022. The former occupant of the space was a subsidiary of WPP, which was relocated into the conglomerate’s headquarters at 3 World Trade Center. When WPP opened its World Trade Center campus in 2018, around 4,000 of its employees worked in the building. After WPP’s consolidation, the office now has a headcount of around 6,500 on paper. Although WPP has leased some additional space over the years, a former WPP employee told me the World Trade Center offices were already short on desks, conference rooms, and anyplace to make a private phone call, and had no idea how the company was possibly going to fit in everyone who is supposed to work there now that Read has told them all to come back 4 days a week. The CEO conceded he wasn’t sure himself. “If everybody follows the rules on day one, we’ll probably have some challenges,” Read told me. Although the current World Trade Center office capacity is considerably smaller than its overall headcount, in reality some percentage of employees will still not use the space. Some are assigned to be embedded with their clients. Some remote workers have been grandfathered in or have been able to negotiate waivers. Still, the office will certainly be more crowded. A WPP spokesman says that the company is not currently looking to sign new leases, but it has directed its individual companies to reassess and if necessary reconfigure their interior spaces. Five years after drawing up its strategic plan, WPP has come to the realization that desks are, in fact, essential to work. Read anticipates WPP will be stronger once its office returns to normal. “When we get through to the other side, it’s going to be better for our culture,” he says. “Our ideas will be better. And actually, our workforce, our people, will be happier.” Now they all just need a place to sit.

Jake Fischer was at a friend’s birthday party when a push notification lit up his phone just after midnight on February 2. His first thought: “That can’t be real.” The incoming tweet from ESPN’s senior NBA insider Shams Charania revealed that the Dallas Mavericks had unexpectedly traded their young superstar Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Dončić trade shocked the basketball world. Why would the Mavericks give away their best player, an ascendant 25-year-old who led them to the NBA Finals last season? BREAKING: The Dallas Mavericks are trading Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and a 2029 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Three-team deal that includes Utah. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 2, 2025 Within minutes, a front office employee involved in the trade texted Fischer about it. Then someone from the Mavericks sent a message confirming the deal was, in fact, real. (As word spread, videos surfaced online showing the stunned reactions of fellow NBA players in the middle of their own games.) Soon, people were reaching out to Fischer, who also reports on the inner workings of the NBA, to verify the news. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] It was an especially big moment for sports journalism, which now devotes as much attention to the high drama of player transactions as it does to the actual competition. Once the story broke, Fischer stayed up until 4 a.m. calling around to investigate what happened and gather intel about other possible deals that could occur before the NBA’s February 6 trade deadline. “The way I cover this stuff, I’m always looking for a throughline and a trend that is connecting everything,” he said. “The Luka trade was the easiest way in. You could call anyone in the league and talk about that.” He spoke to contacts across the country, got a few hours of sleep, then picked up his phone as soon as he woke up to do it all again. When he wasn’t talking, he was writing. In the three days leading up to the trade deadline, he published four bylines about the latest NBA news. The NBA insider is a relatively new role in sports media. In the heyday of print journalism, player transactions were often buried in small font without a byline on the last page of the sports section. Today, however, an insider’s job consists of communicating with sources — such as front office executives and agents — and trying to break news before anyone else. One of the biggest challenges is scrutinizing where the details come from. In the NBA, an exchange of favors, rumors, and leaks goes on between league sources and reporters behind the scenes. Agents want to know how the latest whispers might affect the players and coaches they represent. Front office employees want to probe what other teams are thinking, or maybe mislead the competition if it can give them an edge. It’s the insider’s responsibility to confirm what’s real and convey that to the public. The role gained prominence back around 2010 thanks to Adrian Wojnarowski, an NBA writer for Yahoo Sports, who developed a following by posting his intel as quickly as possible on Twitter from his phone, which cut down on the time needed to edit and publish a traditional news article. His scoops got so popular fans gave them a nickname: Woj bombs. And he became such a household name that people bid up to $5,000 during an auction to buy his old iPhones. “There was a perfect storm of interest in the NBA, and then I think 2010 changed interest in free agency,” Wojnarowski said on a podcast last year. “That became its own thing, the trades, the deals, the buildup to the deals.” RELATED ARTICLECan reporters make bets on sports they cover? We asked a dozen newsrooms.Sarah ScireNovember 2, 2023Over time, breaking news also became big business. As a result, insiders turned into valuable media stars. With sports gambling now legal in 38 states, the public craves immediate updates since any news about a player could shift betting odds. In 2015, Wojnarowski emerged as a coveted free agent in his own right, and eventually left Yahoo for ESPN in 2017 after a bidding war. By the time he retired from sports journalism in 2024, he was in the middle of a three-year, $20 million contract from ESPN, meaning he made more money than many of the players he covered. ESPN hired Shams Charania to fill Wojnarowski’s insider role, reportedly for $3 million per year. While insiders typically work for established media companies like ESPN, where they benefit from substantial resources and access to big audiences, Jake Fischer’s position stands out. He operates out of his Brooklyn apartment and publishes scoops behind a paywall on Substack. It’s not even his own Substack. He contributes to The Stein Line, which was launched in 2021 by veteran reporter Marc Stein, who has covered the NBA for over 30 years at outlets including ESPN and The New York Times. The Stein Line currently ranks as the fifth most-popular sports newsletter on Substack, with over 40,000 subscribers. (Stein wouldn’t disclose how many are paid subscribers, but Substack’s leaderboard reveals it’s in the thousands.) Unlike Wojnarowski, who worked as a beat reporter at local newspapers before becoming an award-winning columnist, and Charania, who started trying to be an insider while still in high school, Fischer began his career hoping to write longform magazine features. “I never wanted to be an insider,” he said. Fischer scored an internship at Sports Illustrated in 2015 and stacked his portfolio with human interest articles. He got coffee with an NBA coach obsessed with Starbucks. He chronicled the rigorous routines that two over-40 players went through to stay on the court near the end of their careers. “I made all these relationships around the NBA by writing these non-threatening stories,” he said. During that stretch at Sports Illustrated, Fischer also became friends with Stein. “He kept reporting stuff that made me say, ‘Damn…I wish I had that.’ It was impossible not to take notice of his work,” Stein told me over email. “Gradually, I became a sounding board for him, to the extent that was possible when we were in direct competition.” In 2019, Fischer was part of mass layoffs at Sports Illustrated. He spent a chunk of time putting together a book, Built to Lose: How the NBA’s Tanking Era Changed the League Forever, which doubled as an audition to become an insider because it required interviewing hundreds of executives, players, scouts, and coaches. Next came a stop at Bleacher Report, which Fischer parlayed into the senior NBA reporter role at Yahoo Sports, the same place Wojnarowski built his reputation. However, in 2024, new management took over the site and declined to pick up Fischer’s contract. Soon after, Stein reached out to see if they could work together. “I was very intrigued by it because of the entrepreneurial aspect of being your own boss,” Fischer said. Insider reporting can be a ruthless, zero-sum game. There are only so many scoops to go around, and journalists can be extremely protective of their sources. That makes Stein and Fischer an interesting team. Fischer refers to Stein as his “work dad” and keeps his contact info pinned to the top of the Messages app on his computer. They share intel and co-byline stories. As Stein says, “We have access to more sources who can help with confirmations if we join forces on a given story.” Most articles containing in-depth reporting sit behind the paywall, but they periodically publish free stories on Substack in addition to revealing scoops on social media. They also have more room to experiment on Substack; for example, they host exclusive chats on the platform, where they take questions from paid subscribers about the latest NBA rumors and theories. In a rare mid-season move, Rip City Remix guard Isaac Nogués Gonzaléz is submitting paperwork to enter the 2025 NBA Draft. “I can defend a lot of positions. Not only the point guard. Not only the best player,” he told me. More here @TheSteinLine: https://t.co/EoT0fxXrq9 pic.twitter.com/rwvqq5xqNp — Jake Fischer (@JakeLFischer) March 3, 2025 Their approach stands out in other ways as well. “We always say we try to be as gentlemanly as possible,” Fischer explained. For example, he tries not to call anyone before 10 a.m. When thinking through the language of scoops, he cares about avoiding certain phrases like “shopping a player,” which can have a negative, almost dehumanizing connotation. Even Fischer’s appearance differs from the typical corporate polish of NBA insiders. He’s scruffy and has long hair that’s smoothed back close to his shoulders. “When a college kid asks me, ‘How do you develop sources?’ I tell them right away, ‘Stop trying to develop sources,’” Fischer said. “Just meet people and treat them as a person.” The attitude sounds both strange and refreshing, but in some ways, it may prevent Fischer from doing whatever is necessary to get a scoop. In the world of insiders, there’s a fine line between source and friend. Wojnarowski, for example, faced criticism for publishing favorable stories about certain sources. However, access isn’t guaranteed, and if a source gets burned with incorrect information, they may never pick up the phone again. “There are so many more walls to smash through today to find that same level of proximity to players, coaches, [and] front offices compared to what I faced for the first two-thirds of my career,” Stein said. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] A few years ago, an agent vowed that his entire agency would never talk to Fischer again after the young reporter relayed bad information. This year, though, that agent called Fischer more than anyone else in the week leading up to the deadline, asking what he’d heard about one client, who ended up getting traded. “I feel like if you treat people well, they always come back,” Fischer said. That mentality may be why he’s managed to carve out a unique role for himself in a constantly evolving sports media landscape. In addition to writing for The Stein Line, Fischer also produces freelance NBA video content for Bleacher Report. Speaking of video, last summer, the NBA agreed to an 11-year, $76 billion new media rights deal that will change how fans can watch games. As part of the deal, streaming services like Amazon and NBC’s Peacock will broadcast some games starting next season. New NBA media partners could also mean new professional opportunities for an insider like Fischer. Fischer told me he had “very cursory conversations” with some of the new media partners back in the fall as they began building out their broadcast teams. Now that the trade deadline is over, those conversations should pick back up. While Fischer could see himself collaborating with Stein for the rest of his career, he’d also welcome the chance to supplement his Substack writing with more on-camera work. “But I would try to do it in my own way,” he said with a grin. “And I’m not cutting my hair.” Jordan Teicher is a freelance writer based in New Jersey.

Venture-capital firm manages $1.5 billion in assets focusing on the video games space By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst The push to utilize generative AI across entertainment isn’t sparing the ever-complex video games industry by any means. With the Game Developers Conference underway this week, Griffin Gaming Partners managing director and co-founder Peter Levin joined Variety Intelligence Platform president Andrew Wallenstein and media analyst Kaare Eriksen on Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast and wasted no breath expressing the urgency with which AI tech is top of mind for the business and development sides of gaming alike. “I think we’re gonna continue to see a bunch of conversations around AI, its impact on games development, its impact on the picks-and-shovels businesses in and around games development,” said Levin. Related Stories VIP+ AI Training – Consent & Content: A Special Report 'Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie' Review: Matt Johnson’s Outrageous Time-Travel Stunt Pays Off Extensive layoffs throughout the global gaming industry are ongoing for more than a year now as major publishers and gaming divisions within larger entertainment companies have gotten aggressive with cost-cutting measures. Concern over AI is mounting among game developers hoping for job prospects to lighten and for stability to come, but Levin sees the embrace of AI as integral to gaming’s future. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: “It’s an optimal time to be a developer or publisher and bake in the AI functionality within your product roadmap,” said Levin. “If they’re not crazy about it, that’s going to happen with or without their sentiment.” “I say this gently and lightly and [am] certainly not celebrating the eradication of anyone’s jobs,” Levin added. “But gaming, traditionally, has been much more akin to enterprise software with respect to recognizing when they need to trim the fat.” AI tech has long been part of the development process and gaming experience across traditional titles, whether for programming enemy NPCs or aiding in procedural generation of player environments, but newer interest in AI in the gaming space has lately revolved around generating content entirely from scratch, utilizing existing assets for UGC purposes and plotting more efficient release strategies. “Some of the ways we’re very excited about the practical application of AI are manifesting in things like customer acquisition, the ability to lever which social media platforms, for example, are the best environments within which to market to a certain customer,” said Levin. Despite the industry’s headwinds, the oncoming launches of Nintendo Switch 2 and “Grand Theft Auto 6” in 2025 have Levin excited, as do emerging markets for games outside of North America and Europe, where smartphone proliferation continues to power the mobile games sector. “You’ve got the telco players, whether that’s the Mittals [Bharti Airtel] or the MTNs or the Vodafones,” said Levin. “They’re looking at what some of the other carriers have done in markets like North America, where they’ve left a lot of money on the table… These carriers really don’t participate in these markets, in the economics, you’ve got Google gobbling up and you’ve got, obviously, Apple and iOS gobbling up their share.” “At some point, these [U.S.] carriers become self-commoditizing big fat pipes, and that’s a mistake that I think in a lot of emerging markets they would like to fix,” Levin said. “So they’re going to invest directly into content. They want more skin in the game. They want a more intimate relationship with that consuming demographic.” Levin continued: “You see a lot of expats in emerging markets, and I think that’s one way to address the opportunity. But at some point you have to have local talent. It’s less expensive. They understand not just the localization of content, but the culturalization of content, which is a much harder needle to thread.” As for Hollywood’s involvement in gaming, Levin praised Remedy Entertainment’s deal with Annapurna Pictures to fund development for “Control 2” in exchange for exclusive film and TV rights to “Control” and “Alan Wake” as a “great example of thinking outside of the box.” Levin is also excited for the prospects of games at Skydance, should its deal to acquire Paramount Global go through. “Hopefully when David Ellison and [Skydance] close on Paramount… I think they’re gonna have a much different orientation towards gaming,” said Levin. “They’re gonna have a longer runway to play with.” “Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

Title: Tech employees are getting the message: Play time's over

For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders. "My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list," he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. "The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so." This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune. "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend," Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a "counter-example" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. "I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of "efficiency" and "intensity" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder. While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them. Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics. Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the "culturally neutered" corporate world had gotten away from "masculine energy." Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic. Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a "country club" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly. Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an "efficiency drive." Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office "at least every weekday." Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022. Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a "pronounced shift" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment. Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs. By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors. As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs. Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new "extremely hardcore" vision and "long hours at a high intensity." At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting. As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting. "People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over," Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. "It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over." By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time. Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc. Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to "do more with less." "There's lots of uncertainty," one longtime Amazon employee said, "and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management." Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls "span of control," tracking the number of reports per manager. Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands. Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to "raise the bar on performance management," as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo. Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what "Googleyness" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being "mission first." "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a longtime Google manager said. "We're being asked to do more for less," said another current longtime Google employee. That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate "gives them the green light to do it openly." Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, "but now the masks are off," the person said. Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's "country club," meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant. One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the "culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same. At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals "unattainable." The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. "You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble," a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. "For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right." The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups. Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the "valley of death," when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable. The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off. "I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money," Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI. Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count. "Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results," said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. "There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory." Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect. "Founders aren't sugarcoating it," said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. "I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real." Have a tip? Contact Ashley Stewart via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Title: Don't call it a recession — but bad vibes are back in a big way

Americans aren't thrilled about the economy. Business Insider has heard from retirees watching their investments fluctuate in the stock market, parents struggling with the high cost of groceries and childcare, and business leaders bracing for a downturn. This comes alongside the Trump administration's roller-coaster tariff announcements and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The US may not be in a recession yet — but we are in a vibecession. This growing distrust could have serious consequences, as a fear-driven pullback in spending is one step toward an actual downturn. Cynical shoppers may avoid nonessential purchases, businesses could pause hiring, and investors might step back from the market. And the slower the economy, the weaker it becomes. "There's a massive amount of uncertainty that's really weighing on people," said Joanne Hsu, who oversees the closely watched University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which in March dropped to its lowest point in three years. "People are really worried that these policies are going to lead to a resurgence in inflation. We're seeing a deterioration in views related to the overall economy, which is related to personal finances, inflation, and most critically, labor markets." The vibecession rears its head whenever Americans are feeling particularly uncertain about the economy. Even if the major economic indicators aren't alarming on paper, rapid changes on Wall Street and in the White House historically make consumers and businesses nervous. Many consumers are worried about how federal policy will shape the cost of essentials such as groceries and housing. The Consumer Sentiment Index — which is based on surveys and interviews with hundreds of US adults by researchers at the University of Michigan — decreased by 16.1 points between December and March. That's the sharpest three-month drop since the pandemic began in 2020. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has climbed over 60 points since December, a much higher-than-typical jump. The measure is based on how often major media outlets are reporting on economic uncertainty, the frequency of disagreement among economic forecasters, and other factors. The research firm Civiqs also found that over a quarter of Americans believe the economy is doing "very bad" right now. Google searches for "recession" have spiked in the past 30 days. Among consumers, Trump is losing ground on what has historically been his — and the GOP's — strongest issue. The majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second-term job performance on the economy (54% disapprove) and how he's handling inflation and cost of living (55% disapprove), per an NBC News poll published March 16. "If people both think the economy is deteriorating and they expect their own incomes to weaken as well, it's hard to imagine how robust consumer spending can really be under those circumstances," Hsu said. Businesses aren't escaping the vibescession either. Many CEOs and executives are worried that the economic uncertainty will put a damper on profits, hiring, and growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that general business conditions, new orders and shipments, employment levels, and financial optimism have all declined among businesses across the state in 2025. "Small businesses have particularly few options and little wiggle room to deal with the sheer size of the tariffs in the pipeline," Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, told BI in an email. "They both squeeze profits margins and prompt cuts to staff, while boosting prices." At the C-Suite level, some companies' plans for hiring and capital investment, as well as sales projections, have decreased since Trump's inauguration, a survey of 150 CEOs by Business Roundtable found. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the March survey report that the downward trends are based on "several factors, including signs of economic headwinds and an atmosphere of uncertainty in Washington." Vibecessions aren't new. Consumer sentiment also dipped during and shortly after the pandemic and again ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Instability in the stock market, high inflation, and job losses often lead to widespread financial anxiety. Still, Americans' current pessimism about the economy is notable. The present vibecession comes in the context of declines in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq in recent weeks. While the markets have shown some signs of recovery, they remain well below their February highs. Trump's steep — and quickly shifting — tariff policies have also left US businesses and consumers expecting a significant jump in prices for things like food, construction materials, electronics, and alcohol. Inflation has eased from its post-pandemic highs, but many shoppers feel like their budgets are stretched thin. The chaos around the availability and cost of eggs, for example, has become a symbol of overall inflation fears. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have added to that uncertainty by firing thousands of federal workers and slashing the budgets of several government programs. Layoffs also hit major companies like Meta, Amazon, Southwest, and others in rapid succession, further fueling the public's perception of economic turmoil. This comes as the white-collar job market has been increasingly difficult to break into, despite overall unemployment rates holding steady. Hsu told BI that consumer sentiment patterns typically fall along party lines — Democrats feel more economically confident when the president is a Democrat, and Republicans more confident under Republican administrations. But in the past few months, consumer sentiment has significantly declined among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. The US isn't in a true recession. Economists and financial analysts told BI that economic downturns are measured on several factors, including long-term labor market and consumer spending data. A few weeks of stock market and policy instability aren't enough to call a recession. Still, even if the US economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession changes consumer behavior. People are likely to tighten their spending on nonessentials and delay major purchases, which could disrupt the travel industry and the housing market. Some small businesses and major corporations have also signaled that they plan to pass the price of Trump's tariffs onto consumers, which could contribute to shoppers buying less. "Moral of the story is that when uncertainty spikes, we tend to err on the side of caution and delay big spending decisions," Swonk said. "We are seeing that base emotion play out in real time in the overall economy." Retirees and hopeful retirees told BI that they are adjusting their stock market and 401(k) investments to be more conservative. Hsu said job seekers may also become less likely to leave their current jobs or seek outside promotions, affecting labor market churn. The stock market has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, but America's latest vibecession isn't over — and the future is hard to predict. "We're in a really unprecedented policy environment," Hsu said. "With policy changing every day, and every hour in some situations, it's really hard for consumers to plan in a meaningful way."

Title: The Wiretap: CISA Staff Are Cautiously Optimistic About Trump’s Pick For Director

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster , Forbes Staff. The Wiretap is your weekly digest of cybersecurity, internet privacy and surveillance news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) President Trump has chosen the new head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Sean Plankey will take the helm, having previously served in the last Trump administration as director of cyber policy at the National Security Council, security positions at the Energy Department and Cyber Command and chief information officer for the Navy. Three employees inside the agency told Forbes they were cautiously optimistic about the new CISA director, who will be looking to steady a ship rocked by swift layoffs that hit a number of key projects, from securing elections to protecting AI systems from cyberattack. Over recent weeks, CISA employees, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, had told Forbes morale was low and concerns were high that important work was being hampered by the cuts. Two staffers and a recently-departed employee pointed to the Secure By Design initiative, which had major tech companies like Amazon and Google agree to implement procedures to ensure security in their products before they’re released to the public. While it remains active, a number of those who led the project have departed, leading to concerns that it is now understaffed, two insiders said. AI and open source security work has also been hit, as Wired recently reported. Plankey will be replacing the interim chief Bridget Bean over the coming weeks, should he pass through Senate confirmation, and two staffers said they’re happy someone with a long history in security is taking over. That Plankey is largely “non-controversial” and has worked across both the Pentagon and DHS should stand him in good stead, said one staffer. “I think most people are optimistic that we got a serious person with experience,” they added. The new director has yet to meet CISA staff. For now, one staffer said programs are getting ready to pitch themselves to Plankey to make sure they survive an “impending reorganization.” Many remain unsure how severe the downsizing will be, another said, only that it is coming this year. Meanwhile, after a restraining order was put on the Trump administration’s firings, CISA is having to re-hire any probationary staff laid off after January 20.

Mamadi Doumbouya for Forbes In some astonishing allegations filed in a northern California court this week, workforce management provider Rippling accused rival Deel of a corporate espionage campaign. The former alleged that the latter co-opted a Rippling employee to spy on its comms channels to look out for signs of customers switching away from Deel. The suit claims that Rippling set a trap to catch the rogue employee, saying it sent a letter detailing a Slack channel of interest to specific Deel execs. Within hours the suspected insider was searching for the make-believe channel. Deel has denied all wrongdoing. Apple has challenged a U.K. order that it open up a backdoor into users’ encrypted iCloud backups, but had to do so in a closed-door meeting at the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal. American lawmakers have raised concerns about the secretive, privacy-invading move. A sonic weapon was allegedly used against Serbian protesters over the weekend, as footage showed crowds fleeing what sounded like a low-flying jet. The government has denied any such anti-protest weaponry was deployed. Such tools have been used to deter demonstrations for years and the best known devices are the Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs), which are manufactured by Genasys. From March 28, Amazon is taking away Alexa users’ ability to prevent voice recordings being sent off to the tech giant’s servers. The reason? It needs to train its Alexa AI, reports Ars Technica. Google announced the acquisition of cloud cybersecurity provider Wiz in a $32 billion deal. A previous attempt to buy the company at $23 billion faltered last year. It’s Google’s biggest acquisition ever by quite a lot– the second largest was its purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2011. Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old Russian and Israeli dual national, has been extradited from Israel to the U.S. to face charges he helped develop the LockBit ransomware. Per a Department of Justice release, “Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States.”

Title: Streaming Viewers Are Willing to Accept Ads, But Not If They're Paying for it, Tubi Finds

As more and more streamers pile into advertising-led subscription services there are signs of a potential backlash among consumers with nearly 80% agreeing that if they’re paying for a streaming service, they expect no ads at all. That’s according to a new survey by Tubi, which also found that nearly half of Gen Z viewers found ads that seem misaligned with their own preferences to “significantly disrupt” their enjoyment of the streaming experience. Worth noting upfront that Tubi’s research, conducted as it is with The Harris Poll, is self-serving. The Fox-owned streamer, which claims more than 97 million monthly active users mostly in the U.S, is a largely free ad supported service. Nonetheless, the warning is there for streamers like Netflix or Amazon Prime as they ramp up ads and charge $6.99 and $8.99 a month for the basic with-ads service respectively. For instance, 81% of consumers told Tubi that watching ads is a fair trade-off for access to free streaming content and encouragingly for ad buyers 59% of viewers say they'd consider taking action after seeing interesting ads while streaming. This figure leaps up to 81% among Gen Z but there’s a catch: most ads miss the mark. 73% of Gen Z viewers though the ads they see when streaming “seem misaligned with my personal preferences.? This highlights a major missed opportunity for brands to create more relevant, impactful advertising. “Overwhelmingly, consumers see paid platforms with ads as a bad deal,” the report states. “Let’s face it, ads can feel disruptive, but they’ll be a more welcome interruption if they are relevant to the viewer and serve as a fair trade-off for free content.” The survey also reinforced the budget concerns of a subscription saturated target audience. Streaming is a sizable chunk of consumers' monthly entertainment budget – On average, consumers are spending $129 per month on streaming + cable which is $20 more than they spend on clothes each month $109. 56% of consumers say they monitor streaming services carefully, so as to not overspend, and Gen Z viewers are particularly cost-sensitive: 76% say they have or would end their streaming subscription over increased price. On average, viewers are juggling nearly 7 streaming services, with a mix of paid streaming services (3.9 on average) and free services (2.6 on average). Other frustrations that cause subscription switch-offs: removal of content (66% agree), irrelevant content (63% agree), tiered memberships (63% agree) and password crackdowns (45%, up 5% YoY). Two-thirds (67%) of Gen Z watchers have ended a streaming subscription because they finished watching the show or movie they were interested in – and there was no other relevant programming on the platform for them. A significant portion of Gen Z are looking to downsize their streaming use: 29% say they use more services now than they plan to in the future. It also found that password sharing is becoming a tricky social dilemma. Seven in 10 viewers told the survey that they wouldn't share their streaming login with a romantic partner unless they were seriously dating. “Why? Because like a toothbrush, once it's shared, there's no going back,” the report states. 44% of Gen Z admit that they've continued using an ex's streaming platform login even after they broke up. The unspoken rules of password sharing haven't got easier. More than half (53%) of Gen Z viewers think that password sharing has made relationships with family & friends more complicated, and 38% confess that they've stopped dating someone because their taste in TV / movies was so different. Tubi's conclusion: “Perhaps the era of the password pass around is over with viewers opting to keep their streaming relationships strictly professional.” In terms of content, Tubi found viewers favoring indies over remakes. 70% of US streamers want to see more TV shows & movies on platforms that are independent or from smaller creators (a 4% increase YoY). 73% of Gen Z says they prefer to watch original content over franchises/remakes; and 72% of Gen Z streamers wish they had more of a say in the type of content that gets made for streaming services. Tubi, the free streaming service owned by Fox, flew under the radar for years, but now the industry has taken note of its surging popularity. At NAB New York, Peter Kafka, Business Insider's chief correspondent about the TV/streaming landscape, talked with Tubi CEO Anjali Sud about the TV/streaming landscape and how her company is changing the ways that people watch. In the pursuit of catalyzing profit, large video streaming companies have been radically altering their approach to growing top-line revenue and curtailing costs for some time now, be it through layoffs, password-sharing crackdowns, licensing of catalog content to rival streamers, and, notably, the introduction of advertising tiers.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: AI likely to claim 14,000 corporate jobs by early this year as firm eyes cost cuts

Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce major Amazon Inc. is set to lay off 14,000 managerial jobs by early 2025 as the trillion-dollar company aims to cut costs. While this may not be a fresh round of firing, it may be recalled that back in September 2024 Amazon's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andy Jassy announced his plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025. A message from CEO Andy Jassy to the employees dated 16 September 2024 noted that he feels that the company can have a better organizational structure to drive the level of ownership and speed it desires. "We want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time," Andy said. LiveMint has reached out to Amazon for an official comment to get an update on any recent changes to this decision. "We’re asking each s-team (senior-team) organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day," he added. Speaking on the issue of improving efficiency, Andy batted for returning to work from office. "To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," the CEO's message read, adding that “having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted.” Reportedly, the company seeks to save between ₹210 crore and ₹360 crore annually after the said workforce reduction. These managerial job cuts will bring down the number of managers in the firm to 91,936 managers, compared to the current level of 1,05,770 managers. As of 2024, 15.5 lakh employees work at Amazon, compared to its previous levels of nearly 15.3 lakh employees, according to Business Insider.

Title: Amazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5B yearly

Amazon is set to cut around 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025, aiming to save between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. This reduction marks a 13% drop in Amazon’s global management workforce, shrinking the number of managers from 105,770 to 91,936. This move follows recent layoffs in Amazon’s communications and sustainability units, as the company pushes to streamline operations and restructure teams. According to Business Insider, the job cut is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s strategy to simplify decision-making and speed up processes. Last month, Jassy announced plans to boost the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. He emphasized that reducing managerial layers would streamline operations and enable Amazon to make faster decisions without getting bogged down by bureaucracy. In a note released Thursday, Morgan Stanley projected that Amazon’s plan could cut around 13,834 managerial roles by early next year, saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion. The estimate is based on the assumption that managers make up 7% of Amazon’s workforce. “Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion,” Business Insider reported. As part of this plan, Amazon has launched a “bureaucracy tipline,” encouraging employees to flag inefficient procedures that slow down work. Managers have also been instructed to increase their direct reports, limit senior hires, and review pay structures to support the shift toward a leaner management model. This layoff wave continues Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts that saw over 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The company has also pulled back on projects that didn’t yield profits, including its “Try Before You Buy” clothing initiative and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service. Amazon’s workforce saw significant growth during the pandemic, swelling to over 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in late 2019. Although numbers have dipped since then, the company is still recalibrating its staffing needs. Earlier this year, Amazon mandated that corporate employees return to the office five days a week. Some staff were asked to relocate to designated office hubs, prompting some to leave rather than move. Management restructuring is another key part of Jassy’s approach, with efforts to reduce layers between employees and leadership. This move places Amazon alongside other tech companies trimming their workforce.

Title: You can't split a payment on Airbnb directly — here's what you can do instead

Time Published: 2025-03-17T16:46:37Z

Up until 2018, Airbnb offered a feature that was a favorite among users: split rental fees. With a few extra clicks of your mouse or taps on your phone, you could invite everyone staying at a rental to pay their share of the fee and avoid those awkward conversations about who owed who how much cash or who already sent money through Venmo. However, you can no longer split payments on Airbnb. So, if you want to split the cost of an Airbnb rental, you have to do it the old-fashioned way — with a few exceptions. The simplest way to split the cost of an Airbnb is for one person to handle the entire payment via the Airbnb site or app and then have everyone else pay their fair share through Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, or any other preferred payment app. Most rentals will also allow you to pay a down payment when booking and then pay the rest in installments, giving you time to collect payments from everyone else staying at the Airbnb. If you choose to pay in installments, you can use a different credit card for each payment, which may be a good option if there are just two of you splitting the bill. If you're renting a long-term Airbnb, you also have the option of using a different payment method for each recurring monthly charge. If you're the one to lay down your credit card, you can also collect a large number of points, especially if you use a travel credit card. Unfortunately, Airbnb doesn't make it easy to split payments for a reservation if you're traveling with a group. Your best option is for one person to pay and then use an electronic payment service like Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, or Apple Pay to collect reimbursements from the other travelers.

Title: BI spoke with federal workers who voted for Trump — some have come to regret it

Good morning. The backlash Tesla owners are facing over Elon Musk has crossed the pond. Here in London, a man says he was aghast when he was confronted about his vehicle in a parking lot.In today's big story, BI spoke with 10 federal workers who voted for Trump. Months later, some of them now regret it. What's on deck Markets: Rob Arnott thinks the market's tech stock sell-off isn't over. Tech: BI reviewed a leaked ByteDance document showing TikTok staff being evaluated on their "ByteStyle" and more. Business: Needy hospitals are trapped in a cycle of corporate plunder, Bethany McLean writes. But first, some voters feel hoodwinked. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I feel betrayed. This is not what I wanted, to let everybody lose their job." That's what a two-time Trump voter who works for Veterans Affairs told BI. "You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. This is not 'The Apprentice.'" So far, tens of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs as a result of DOGE's efforts to reshape the federal workforce. With Elon Musk as de facto leader, the DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs — some of which have been reversed by court order. Just a few months ago, some of the workers impacted by the cuts may have been celebrating Trump's election victory. They voted for a better economy, lower prices, or more stringent border controls. What they didn't expect was an existential threat to their careers. BI spoke to current and former federal workers who voted for Trump — and some have come to regret it. "If I knew I was going to lose my job because Trump became president, no, I would not vote for him," one worker said. Betrayal. Anger. Regret. You can read what all the workers told BI here. For federal workers hoping to now pivot to the private sector, things might be tricky. Lackluster corporate hiring, a shrinking middle-management job market, and pullbacks by universities are making the route to employment beyond federal agencies trickier to navigate, BI's Tim Paradis writes. Federal workers also face a unique hurdle. Recruiters and career coaches told BI that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear. Adopting a key new skill might help them: translation. 1. Rob Arnott says the sell-off in tech stocks isn't over. "We're seeing the unwinding of a bubble," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told BI. He compared the current market to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and warned that the Magnificent Seven stocks are set to slide further. 2. Why China looks investible again. Just a year ago, investors fled the country in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, with the CSI 300 dropping over 45%. Now, the country's stocks are rallying, thanks to a pro-tech shift from Beijing — and analysts are paying attention. 3. Follow these leaders for sharp insights on recessions. Leading economists are bracing for a recession, although there's been no official call yet. BI compiled a list of the best commentators on recessions, and the warning signs they're watching. 1. Amazon's DeepSeek scramble. When DeepSeek debuted in January, customer demand was so high Amazon rushed to add the AI to its development tool Bedrock. Now, Amazon wants to promote its products as an alternative to DeepSeek and is telling employees to point out its privacy and security issues, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. 2. Meet the Palantir Mafia. The software company's alumni have collectively raised more than $6 billion for their own startups, which include the social-gathering app Partiful and the defense-tech company Anduril. See BI's list of 30 Palantir alums who struck out on their own. 3. How TikTok scores employees. It's performance review season for TikTok employees, and BI viewed a rubric to see how they're scored. Workers are measured on Output, Leadership Principles, and ByteStyles — i.e. a set of workplace values. If an employee receives a low rating, though, they could end up on a PIP. 1. How wealthy investors keep bankrupting needy hospitals. As Steward Health Care closed hospitals and cut corners on care, its top officers got richer, and the profits kept flowing to its private-equity owner Cerberus. Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure: Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes. 2. Older Americans on the shifting job market. Some are taking blue- collar jobs, while others are navigating unemployment. Many told BI that ageism, technology changes, and economic shifts have affected their retirement plans. 3. The ghosted generation. College app rejections. No-show dates. Job apps sent into the void. No one has been more rejected in both their personal and professional lives than Gen Z, writes Delia Cai. It's led young people to adopt a blasé attitude in order to protect themselves — and it could turn them into a generation of incredibly risk-averse adults. It's St. Patrick's Day. Don't forget to wear green. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave). Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Developing the future workforce

Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said.

"The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said.

(photo credit: Chanat Katanyu) Pun Paniangvait, general manager of Thai President Foods Plc, the manufacturer of Mama instant noodles, said the company expects to expand its workforce in line with the growth of its manufacturing operations. The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.
