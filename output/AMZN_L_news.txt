Δ These cuts will be part of the second round of a broader plan to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs, and they will follow the first round that involved 14,000 layoffs in October, Reuters reported Thursday (Jan. 22), citing unnamed sources. The latest round is likely to impact four Amazon business units: Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, which is the firm’s human resources division, according to the report. The full scope of the layoffs is not known, and the plans could change, per the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. According to the Reuters report, the 30,000 jobs that Amazon plans to cut under this plan would amount to only a small portion of the company’s 1.58 million employees but 10% of its corporate workforce. It would also follow Amazon’s elimination of 27,000 jobs in 2022. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue It was reported in October, just before the first round of the latest wave of layoffs, that Amazon planned to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs as part of an effort to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and the number of managers at the company. About a year earlier, in September 2024, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online. When the company began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said Amazon had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Thousands of corporate jobs on chopping block as giant seeks to trim workforce by 30,000 — All we know

American tech and e-commerce giant Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week, as part of its plan to trim its workforce by 30,000, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two sources familiar with the matter. These layoffs — among the company's largest — are likely to impact white-collar roles across divisions, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video and retail, it added. Sources added that the plans could change. In October last year, Amazon culled 14,000 white-collar jobs (around half of its target of 30,000), and is expected to do the same this year, as per the sources. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment, the report added. According to a Bloomberg report, as of September 2025, Amazon had around 1.57 million employees — a majority of whom worked in its warehouses. Its corporate workforce comprised around 3,50,000 people, it added. The Reuters report added that 30,000 cuts would be 10% of the company's corporate workforce. Notably, this would be Amazon's largest layoff in 30 years, after it cut 27,000 roles in 2022. Those laid off in October were given 90 days on payroll to either seek jobs externally or find other roles internally. This period expires on 26 January 2026 (Monday), it added. The Reuters report added that the Seattle-based online retailer's job cuts in October were tied to increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. It cited an internal memo which stated: “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” However, later during the company's Q3 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts that the cuts were not AI-driven or financially driven, but rather due to “culture”. He added, “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers”. In 2025, Jassy said he expected the company's corporate workforce to reduce as AI efficiencies increase. The Reuters report added that to save costs, corporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks. Amazon's AWS itself touted its latest AI models during its annual cloud computing conference in December.

Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000. The latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture. Amazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters earlier reported this latest round of cuts could come as early as next week. Have a tip?

Title: Despite promises that AI will create more jobs, 1.2 million jobs were actually slashed last year

Tech leaders like Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have described AI as a win-win for society; they make ambitious promises that the advanced tech will allow us to turbocharge the labor force, cure cancers, and create new “super well-paid, super interesting jobs” that didn’t exist before. But instead of feeling empowered, many workers fear their jobs are at risk of being automated—and the flood of layoffs in 2025 confirmed their suspicions. A staggering 1.2 million job cuts were announced last year, up 58% from the roughly 760,000 layoffs in 2024, according to a recent report from employment consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In fact, 2025 had the highest level of workforce reductions since 2020, and was neck-and-neck with the 2008 financial crisis, when 1.22 million roles were slashed. The biggest victims of last year’s headcount reduction bloodbath were federal workers. Extreme cost-cutting efforts from Elon Musk’s DOGE crippled entire agencies, including USAID, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In total, about 308,000 government jobs were cut last year. However, the tech industry took the heaviest blow in the private sector. Last year, tech announced that about 154,000 roles would be slashed, a 15% increase from nearly 134,000 job cuts in 2024. The culprit? Rapid AI implementation—and the industry self-correcting from pandemic-era overhiring. In 2025, AI was responsible for 54,836 layoff plans overall; since 2023, the tech has been connected to 71,825 job cut announcements. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry,” the report noted. “This coupled with over-hiring over the last decade created a wave of job loss in the industry.” In a time where the tech industry is growing fast and companies are vying to win the AI race, it might sound counterintuitive for trillion-dollar innovators to be offloading their talent. But CEOs have been open about how AI tools are taking over human skills, and they’re gearing up for more workforce changes. Microsoft let go of 6,000 employees last May, dishing out another round of 9,000 cuts in July. Meanwhile, its CEO Satya Nadella announced AI now writes 20% to 30% of the company’s code; technology that has proven to be so powerful, that the business is funding a $80 billion AI infrastructure drive. At the start of this past year, Meta also announced a 5% workforce reduction—impacting around 3,600 staffers—in an attempt to “move out low-performers faster,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. This came as the tech billionaire admitted AI was on the precipice of “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer.” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy also admitted in a memo sent out to staffers last year that the business “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” Just a few months later, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 roles. While tech layoffs are nothing new, entry-level staffers—who are already facing challenges getting their careers off the ground—will likely feel the sting of AI-related workforce changes more than others. The percentage of employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to 2025 data from compensation management software business Pave. These Gen Z workers accounted for 15% of the workforce at large public tech firms in January 2023; but by August 2025, they only represented 6.8%. The situation isn’t pretty at big private tech companies, either—during that same time period, the proportion of early-career Gen Z employees dwindled from 9.3% to 6.8%. “If you’re 35 or 40 years old, you’re pretty established in your career, you have skills that you know cannot yet be disrupted by AI,” Matt Schulman, founder and CEO of Pave, told Fortune last year. “There’s still a lot of human judgment when you’re operating at the more senior level…If you’re a 22-year-old that used to be an Excel junkie or something, then that can be disrupted. So it’s almost a tale of two cities.”

Title: US applications for jobless benefits inch up last week to a still-low 200,000

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. The Labor Department also recently reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed officials meet again next week, with most analysts and traders expecting central bank officials to keep the benchmark lending rate where it is. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,750 to 201,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 10 declined by 26,000 to 1.85 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Good morning. Bumping into a leading European chief executive as he left the Congress Centre in Davos last night, I asked for a take on President Donald Trump’s speech. “I think we are just tuning out of all that noise a little. Did he say anything we didn’t expect? Was there anything new?” He continued: “We are focusing on our investments, on the AI transition, on security, on our three-to-five-year plans.” He had been at a dinner the night before and that was also “the mood of the table,” American and European. There is only so long you can maintain your risk antenna at 11 on the dial—even as a chief executive. I sense the mood here at Davos was respectful of Trump but resolute in its sense that there are other pressing issues to consider. Fortune hosted a series of panels at USA House, America’s “home base” for the duration of the World Economic Forum. We heard from Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan; Robin Vince, chief executive of BNY; Kellyanne Conway, former counsellor to the president; Mark Penn, CEO of Stagwell; and Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Dalio, leaning on his decades of investment experience, urged business leaders to step back from the day-to-day and focus on the trends—conflict, indebted western governments, and major technology shifts. Trump may be playing in some of those lanes, but not in all of them. “But when you have the president of France saying that we are flirting with a world without rules, surely that will strike fear into leadership teams?” I asked him. Businesses need to sharpen up, he responded, and realize that change is with us for good. On the global stage, Europe can often appear to speak with one voice. But it is more nuanced than that. At our event at USA House, Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform party in the U.K., spoke about the reaction against globalization—a reaction he supports—and said that Trump was a success. Farage’s party is ahead in the polls. Yes, Farage did urge the president to remember the sacrifices of NATO members such as Denmark in U.S.-led conflicts in, for example, Afghanistan. And that self-determination for Greenland was the same as the American desire for freedom from Britain 250 years ago. Davos is about the nuances. It can be easy to ridicule. But for that CEO I bumped into, off to yet another dinner to discuss the transformational nature of AI, the hunt for the signal over the noise continues.—Kamal AhmedContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com President Trump, the dealmaker President Trump has taken a strong business approach to his second term, making unprecedented deals with private-sector leaders like Nvidia and institutions like Columbia University.

Title: Don't call it a layoff: Ubisoft issues a full return-to-office order for all employees as it confirms more studio closures are coming

I can't help wondering if maybe there's a connection. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Stuffed away in a corner of Ubisoft's latest high-speed skid off a cliff is a note for employees: "To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams." Employees who have been working remotely in any capacity, in other words, will no longer have that option: It's back to conventional office time for everyone. "This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams," Ubisoft said, explaining the decision. "In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market." In lieu of regular remote work, employees will be given "an annual allowance of working-from-home days." It seems like a small thing amidst yet another Ubisoft catastrophe, but the reaction to the announcement is strongly negative, and rightly so. Remote work, by and large, works, and after years of doing so effectively and adjusting their lives accordingly, being ordered back to the office on a full-time basis is incredibly disruptive for employees suddenly find themselves faced with a need to find childcare, pay commuting costs, and absorb other related expenses, all with no compensating increase in pay—which is to say nothing of the massive and often unnecessary pain in the ass it is. Because of that, some employees, and possibly many, simply won't do it. Which is the point: It's an effect companies have wielded strategically as a form of "soft layoffs," in which employees aren't actually laid off, but are instead presented with onerous conditions for continued employment that effectively coerces them into resigning. The term can also be applied to, for example, a "voluntary career transition program" in which employees are given the choice to either quit now with some benefits, or risk getting shitcanned later with nothing. Ring a bell? It happened recently at Ubisoft Massive, which in October 2025 offered employees "the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms," and then dropped the hammer earlier this month when not enough of them did so. And yes, more such cuts are coming: Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said today that as part of the company's latest bid to keep the lights on, it will "selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Does a return-to-office mandate fit well with a need to close studios and cut jobs? You bet it does, and we've seen it happen in the past. In 2023, for instance, a World of Warcraft producer said "Blizzard is losing amazing talent" because of Activision-Blizzard's RTO policy, and in April 2025, amidst contract negotiations with Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 member Zachary Armstrong said "underpayment and costly RTO [return to office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment." Ubisoft has done it too. In September 2024 the Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJTV) union called for a strike when Ubisoft told workers that they'd have to come into the office at least three days a week. The RTO mandate (and everything else) has sparked renewed ire from unions. Carmel Smyth, president of CWA Canada—the union representing the recently closed Ubisoft Halifax studio—said it is waiting for proof that the Halifax shutdown "was not to keep out the union," and added pointedly, "as much as the company cries poor, it did just buy a studio from Amazon in Montreal a month ago." Ubisoft is also facing an entirely predictable strike action over what the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique called a "disastrous" restructuring announcement. The union's demands include "maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions." UBISOFT - Call for strike Following the disastrous announcements made by Mr. Yves Guillemot (cost-cutting plan, projects scrapped, end of remote working, etc.), the Solidaires Informatique union is calling for a strike on Thursday, January 22, in the morning. Of course, I can't say that this is an intentional effort to shed hundreds of workers. But I can say that Ubisoft is eager—maybe even desperate—to do so, and as much as it tries to mask the maneuver in terms of collaboration and efficiency, it is what it is: Some employees will leave rather than return to the office, and that's what Ubisoft wants.

Title: Ubisoft Shake-Up: Layoffs, Studio Closures Begin in Major Reorg; Six Games Canceled, Including ‘Prince of Persia’ Remake

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer After weeks of speculation following reported studio closures and rounds of layoffs, French video game publisher Ubisoft announced Wednesday it is launching a reorganization of the company that will see operations divided into five “Creative Houses,” each focused on a specific creative genre. As a result, six games in the works at Ubisoft, including the upcoming “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, have been scrapped. Related Stories Disney Sees Brisk Ad Sales for Oscars While Spotlighting Live Shows (EXCLUSIVE) Disney Ups Jimmy Zasowski to President of Platform Distribution for Disney Entertainment, ESPN The five decentralized houses part of the new model “will combine game development and go-to-market functions with a gamer-centric approach, and be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy as well as editorial direction;” “will be shaped by distinct creative ‘genres’ led by dedicated high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres;” and “have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.” Popular on Variety During a media call Wednesday, Ubisoft leadership would not confirm how many more layoffs (the Halifax and Stockholm studios have now been shuttered) will be coming as the 17,000-employee company is restructured, but noted details on work force reduction will be shared at a later date. Per Ubisoft, the five new creative houses include the following, the first being Ubisoft’s new subsidiary, Vantage Studios, which began operations last year: Along with the “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” remake, Ubisoft has discontinued four unannounced games and one mobile title that “do not meet the new enhanced quality aswell as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.” Ubisoft says it will allocate additional development time to seven unnamed games in order to “ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation,” including an unannounced title initially planned to release in fiscal year 2026 that has now been delayed to fiscal year 2027. According to Ubisoft, four new IPs are currently in development, including the game “March of Giants,” which it recently required from Amazon, and the creative houses where those games will be allocated will be announced at a later date. As part of the restructuring, Ubisoft will return to a five-days-per-week in office policy for all teams, which will include an annual allowance of working-from-home days. Amid the news Wednesday, Ubisoft shared early results for its latest quarter, reporting €330 million in sales, which it says are “primarily driven by an overperformance linked to partnerships and reflecting a robust back-catalog.” The full earnings will be reported Feb. 12 as previously announced. “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” Yves Guillemot, Founder and CEO of Ubisoft, said in a statement Wednesday. “On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences. At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.” Guillemot’s statement continues: “To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization. We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term. Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term. The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

The American empire of Trump’s investment pledges: Heavily weighted on AI data centers and pharma. Neither of which produce economic growth on behalf of consumers. Data centers add cost to every business, including utilities and water which are heavily weighted. Water; one data center can use upwards of a million gallons daily. Electricity; one data center can use the same amount of electricity as an entire town. Pharma does not add to growth – they add to injury and death. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. These are not economic boosters – they are nightmares. Data centers are like banks – nonproducing economic drains. Defense spending needs to be cut by 70%. It does NOT add to the economy – it is a toilet emptying into a sewer. We need unimpeded trade. Manufacturing is a dying art in America. Revitalizing it without ‘workers’ is a dead fish stinking up the sewer. Trump is focusing on elites which in the long term is simply another toilet. Elites don’t produce, they don’t work. The $18 trillion in investments has been redefined as $9.7 trillion weighted between Middle East pledges with the exclusion of Israel which produces IDF mercenaries. Somehow, Japan’s initial ten-year pledge of $490 billion has ratcheted up to $1 trillion per the White House. Does Japan know? Because Japan’s government/economy is heavily indebted – ranking number one in the world at over 250% of GDP. Meta has pledged $600 billion on net equity of $182 billion. Its pledge is based on AI and ‘workforce expansion’ which has so far resulted in 4,600 layoffs and an announcement that 10% more are forthcoming. Apple has also announced major restructuring. Its balance sheet reveals current assets short roughly $20 billion compared to current assets. Net equity of $73 billion. Pledges are only as good as the air we breathe – remastered by chemtrails and toxins. The fact that Trump desperately needs adulation is indicative of a man whose façade is deception. Having been married to a psychologically diagnosed narcissist – I have become intimately aware of the traits. Pathological lying is ALWAYS one of the prominent symptoms. Middle East pledges are typically defense- and pharma-related. Like defense, pharma does not add to economic growth because it creates disease and disease means death. The White House is either grossly deluded or grossly deluding when it purports to state that these ‘investments’ have ANY positive effect on the standard of living for Americans. The biggest drivers of a good economy for consumers are built on wage growth, stable prices, low interest rates, and rising asset values – particularly housing. Wage growth has been artificially linked to false inflation numbers. Prices have risen 50% when inflation is clocked at 2%. Trump called for a 10% interest cap on credit cards to which not ONE has agreed to the ‘suggestion’. Why? Because it is not a law. It is merely a superficial request. Like a pledge. Like a pinky swear. Like – when my ship rolls in. Trump is simply Biden with a different AI projection. An illusion. Delusions of grandeur have consumed politicians and bankers and we need to extricate these human imposters before The Georgia Guidestones become our reality. Of course, the $1.598 question is – How? History answers the question. But it also reveals that the sewage has never been fully cleansed of its putrid toxins and instead humanity bought time. Before the cycle was reborn. Each time, more evil than the last. As though Hell itself was opened upon earth. This concept is being played out between Russia and Ukraine as Putin slowly comes to the realization that a peace deal on a piece of paper is meaningless. The only answer to the elimination of evil is its complete eradication. While various journalists including Seymour Hersh radically denounce Russia for not being more formidable in their destruction of humanity, Putin’s deterrence was rooted in humanity – and unless you have been assigned this military command you can’t possibly understand. Zelenskyy, Trump, Netanyahu are aligned in a psychological Babylonian construct. Killing innocent persons – for the greater good – would be Hersh’s means of ending conflict; a decision that for a true Christian is untenable in the sight of God. Hindsight is always the greatest insight. As I have stated before – when you do as they do, you become the enemy you fight.

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Δ Seven snapshots reveal how climate rollbacks altered the trajectory of U.S. energy, environmental protection, and economic security. In just one year, President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed the arc of federal climate and environmental policy. Upon returning to office 12 months ago, Trump immediately declared an “energy emergency” and promised to “unleash American energy.” He packed his cabinet with oil executives and climate skeptics who have since rolled back the climate initiatives and protections of presidents Obama and Biden while accelerating fossil fuel development. From dismantling regulations designed to cut emissions and tame pollution to repealing the country’s most ambitious climate action, Trump has reveled in reversing years of progress. He has withdrawn from both the Paris Agreement and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and undercut scientific research at every opportunity. This retrenchment came even as much of the world moved forward in 2025. Worldwide, renewables provided 40 percent of all electricity. Coal-fired power generation declined in India and China for the first time in two generations. Global clean energy investment was 50 percent higher than fossil fuel investment. Still, the United States has clearly ceded leadership in the climate fight. These seven charts reflect a year with implications that will be felt for a long time to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The first year of Trump 2.0 brought sweeping changes to Washington’s view of electric vehicles, and American automakers felt the squeeze. President Donald Trump and Congress took several steps to eliminate federal support for it, including eliminating the $7,500 consumer tax credit. The administration also slashed fuel-economy targets — from about 50 mpg by 2031 to roughly 35 — and eliminated penalties for automakers that miss efficiency standards. The combined effect: higher prices for many electric vehicles built in the United States, uncertainty around battery and manufacturing investments, and a weaker regulatory push that now favors hybrids and conventional vehicles. EV market share in the country, which briefly topped 10 percent in the third quarter as buyers rushed to claim the expiring credit, has since fallen to single digits. Meanwhile, the global EV industry continues to accelerate, making the U.S. retreat look like a concession to China — and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Chinese industrial policy continues driving down costs, with industry giants CATL and BYD now supplying more than half of the world’s batteries. BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV manufacturer, selling 2.26 million cars in 2025 compared to Tesla’s 1.64 million. In the United States, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down, killed the F-150 Lightning pickup, and planned a pivot toward hybrids, citing federal policy changes as the primary driver. There was one bright spot in the data, though: The price gap between used internal combustion and electric vehicles is rapidly narrowing, and as of August it reached a record low of just $897. A glut of used EVs are also expected to hit the market over the next few years, which could drive prices down even further. So: The first year of Trump’s second term hasn’t exactly decimated the American EV industry, but it has transformed what might have been a sustained industrial policy push into a landscape of slow growth, rapid market shifts, and further consolidation of China’s manufacturing and battery supply chains. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How – Clayton Aldern, senior data reporter One of the more counterintuitive aspects of climate change is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions often requires more energy, not less. That’s because of electrification: Technologies like induction stoves, heat pumps for homes and factories, and electric cars all draw the grid. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence requires ever more power-hungry data centers, further straining the electrical system. Yet in the first year of its second term, the Trump administration did everything in its power to slow the rollout of renewables like wind and solar, and even stalled several offshore wind projects already under development — even as rising electricity demand made them increasingly necessary. But even against these political headwinds, green energy continued to surge. States like California and Texas kept expanding solar, wind, and storage capacity, showing that market economics outweigh federal roadblocks. Electricity demand in the United States grew 3.1 percent last year, according to energy think tank Ember. At the same time, solar generation rose by 27 percent, meeting nearly two-thirds of that extra demand. Utilities have also been building huge battery banks to store that juice for use when the sun isn’t shining: California added nearly 70 percent more storage capacity in 2024 than the year before. While it will take time to suss out the Trump administration’s impact on this energy transition, it’s clear that market forces remain a powerful driver for states that understand that a cleaner grid is a cheaper, more reliable grid. – Matt Simon, senior staff writer The Federal Emergency Management Agency often makes headlines during disasters, but in recent years it also has spent billions helping hundreds of communities prepare for future catastrophes. The agency has long doled out grants to alleviate floods in low-lying areas and weatherize against storms, and under the Biden administration it launched new programs to build resilience against climate-fueled threats like wildfires and extreme heat. These programs have provided money to elevate thousands of homes in low-lying areas, manage flammable vegetation, and upgrade sewers to handle runoff from freak storms. That effort came to a stop earlier this year after Trump vowed to shrink federal spending. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced all FEMA payments above $100,000 would require her approval, reportedly creating a billion-dollar backlog of transactions. Quarterly spending on the program fell from a peak of around $500 million under Biden to less than zero last year as FEMA clawed back money from some recipients. The agency also has halted all new approvals for resilience projects. FEMA has continued to endorse new projects that don’t have an explicit climate focus, like installing backup generators and drafting disaster response plans, but it has shut down the Biden-era Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which funded long-term investments to reduce climate-related risks. FEMA does not appear to have approved a single project under that program since Trump’s inauguration, despite a federal court ruling in December ordering it to continue the program. – Jake Bittle, staff writer The country’s bedrock environmental laws are only as strong as their enforcement. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, working alongside their state counterparts, are responsible for protecting the public and holding polluters accountable. But over the past year, the Trump administration has dismantled those agencies with sweeping layoffs and budget cuts, undercutting their ability to fulfill their missions. More than 11,500 employees of the two agencies have been laid off or resigned, including dozens from enforcement divisions. That’s left fewer federal inspectors to track pollution and fewer attorneys to pursue violators. That pullback is already reshaping how often — and how forcefully — the government goes after polluters. Over the first nine months of both Trump’s first term and the Biden presidency, the Justice Department launched roughly 40 civil enforcement cases against polluters. During the same stretch last year, it initiated just 11. The slowdown extends to prosecutions as well. Under the previous two administrations, the number of consent decrees resulting from federal cases typically hovered around 50. Last year, that figure fell to just 24, weakening one of the federal government’s most effective tools for forcing cleanup and compliance. The retreat deepens a decades-long erosion in regulatory oversight. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, many state environmental agencies — which carry out much of the day-to-day enforcement of such laws — have seen their funding for that work slashed. Between 2010 and 2024, those budgets declined in more than half of all U.S. states, and by more than one-third in at least seven. With federal enforcement budgets also being reduced, oversight is shrinking at every level of government. – Naveena Sadasivam, senior staff writer Delivering on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” President Trump, during his inaugural address, signaled a sweeping overhaul of federal land management. Later that day, he declared a national energy emergency and promised to fast-track domestic energy production and infrastructure “from coast to coast.” The directive marked a profound shift in the management of public land and coastal waters, with the goal of rapidly expanding fossil fuel development. In the year since, the Trump administration has targeted roughly 88 million acres that were once set aside for recreation and conservation, opening them for oil and gas development and logging. At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management, responsible for managing public lands for multiple uses and long-term sustainability, has held 22 lease sales and approved 6,027 new oil and gas permits, the highest number since 2010, according to the Center for American Progress. Some of the nation’s most sensitive landscapes are now at risk of development. The administration has, for example, moved to end protections for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which covers 19 million acres. Other threatened areas include forestland in the Boundary Waters region of Minnesota, the high desert mesas and canyons surrounding New Mexico’s Chaco Culture National Historical Park, approximately 58 million acres of roadless wilderness throughout the national forest system, and roughly 87 million acres of unique habitat for threatened and endangered species. These moves put ecosystems, wildlife, cultural sites, and communities at risk, transforming land once preserved for the public good into resources to be exploited by industry. – Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco, Midwest regional climate reporter The Inflation Reduction Act set aside about $2 billion to underwrite clean energy and climate resilience projects for tribal nations. The Trump administration has slashed funding for such work, leaving communities scrambling for alternatives and undermining progress toward their energy sovereignty. The federal grants and incentives helped tribes build solar farms, develop microgrids, expand battery storage, and advance climate-adaptation projects on their lands. For many communities, these initiatives weren’t just about clean energy, but providing a service people elsewhere take for granted. Tribal households face 6.5 times more outages than the U.S. average and a 28 percent higher energy burden. Roughly 54,000 residents of tribal lands lack electricity entirely. Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed or frozen programs, including a $20 million grant to an Alaska village fighting coastal erosion, and, among other actions, threatened the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that had promised $3 billion to 350 recipients. Without that backing, projects have stalled or teetered on collapse, leaving communities scrambling for private funding, philanthropic support, or loans to keep them moving forward. These cuts do more than slow the clean energy transition. They threaten Indigenous sovereignty, economic opportunity, and resilience to climate change. Tribal nations are having to reconsider their plans, seek new financing, and defend projects that were years in the making. As Washington pulls back, they are pushing forward, but the stakes for their communities, their lands, and their self-determination could not be higher. — Miacel Spotted Elk, Indigenous Affairs fellow For the nation’s farmers, 2025 was defined by uncertainty and mounting expenses as President Trump’s trade war reshaped agricultural markets. A protectionist agenda that his administration said would protect workers and lower costs instead left growers — particularly those who raise commodities like soybeans — with fewer buyers, higher bills, and an uncertain labor market. In February, Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China, along with 25 percent levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico. Further duties followed in April. China retaliated with a 34 percent tax on products from the United States; in May, it stopped buying U.S. soybeans altogether. The escalating trade war with one of the country’s biggest markets for agricultural exports hit soybean and other commodity farmers hard. It didn’t help that Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum led to higher prices for farm equipment. China resumed purchasing U.S. soybeans in October, shortly before Trump announced the two countries had reached a trade deal. But prior to that, the Asian superpower had turned to other soybean producers, including Brazil and Argentina. That move has grave environmental implications. Production of the legume is a major contributor to deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado, a biodiverse savannah in central Brazil. Last month, Trump announced $12 billion in bridge payments to help farmers recover from the financial losses they’ve incurred. However, U.S. agricultural trade groups say it doesn’t go far enough to compensate farmers and reassure them that their livelihoods won’t rocked by future trade scuffles. — Frida Garza, staff writer A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Six things to know about Germany's job market in 2026

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Headlines about job cuts, the struggling economy and layoffs sparked by AI are common at the moment. But how is the German job market faring and what can we expect in 2026? Whether you are looking for a job, want to change industries or have your eye on Germany as a place to find new career opportunities, we've rounded up some trends affecting the job market this year. Workers want job security It's fair to say that Germany's labour market hasn't exactly been thriving of late – and unfortunately, this is expected to continue. The number of job vacancies has almost halved since its peak in 2022, and is even lower than pre-Covid times. "What is particularly dramatic is that fewer new jobs are being advertised than ever before," Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), told German business newspaper Handelsblatt in a report earlier in January. This makes it a difficult market and means that many people are prioritising stable positions rather than giving up a job they don't like to or going freelance. "Employees are looking for reliable conditions," said labour market expert Julius Probst from recruitment portal Stepstone. Jobs that offer security are therefore likely to remain highly competitive in 2026, especially if they come with a decent salary and the opportunity to work flexibly. READ ALSO: Five hard truths foreign jobseekers need to know Remote/flexible working is not as easy When it comes to flexible working, employees may have to take a step back in 2026. The range of remote work options is declining slightly, studies by the job portal Indeed suggest, with employers having the upper hand. According to the latest data, flexible arrangements are only offered in around 14.1 percent of all job advertisements at the moment, with flexible working hours only offered in 19 percent. At the beginning of 2025, the proportion of jobs offering 'home office' options was 14.7 percent, while 20.2 percent of ads mentioned flexible working hours. It may be because more roles where in-person attendance is required are being advertised. These include sectors like construction, health, care and defence, where remote work and flexibility are difficult to implement. The takeaway is: it's not impossible but remote working isn't as accessible. "Working from home is changing from the norm to a negotiable benefit," said Virginia Sondergeld, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. This is a tend seen across the world as many managers have implemented mandatory office attendance following relaxed rules during the pandemic era. READ ALSO: Where most jobs are expected to be cut in 2026 AI is important – but it's not wiping out all jobs in Germany Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll be aware that everyone is talking about generative AI, known as KI (Künstliche Intelligenz) in German. So how is AI affecting the labour market in Germany? Several companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, which employ people in Germany, have cited AI as the main reason for recent redundancies. But it's not all bad news. "While the number of job ads is declining overall in areas such as marketing, HR and project management, the demand for AI skills in these very professions is exploding," said Sondergeld. Importantly, we're not seeing mass layoffs across the board. A recent study by the IAB found that AI could see 800,000 jobs lost by 2040, but the same study said AI will create around 800,000 new jobs during the same period. The IAB study authors said the technology could even help increase Germany's GDP by 0.8 percentage points annually. Enzo Weber described AI as "the technology of our time that can be used across all areas". He added: "It will take on more and more tasks, but there will be a transformation in the job market, not a collapse.” Meanwhile, economist Julius Probst said jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills will not be affected. It essentially means an understanding of AI will be important in 2026, but it's not needed everywhere. Career changers are in demand as worker shortage grows If you've been looking to take on new skills or move to a different sector altogether, now is the time. As The Local has reported, Quereinsteiger (career-changers) are in demand. These people enter a new profession without the traditional qualifications and experience from that field. READ ALSO: Why demand for 'career changers' is rising sharply in Germany But that's exactly why they are sought after. HR managers like that they bring their experience and perspectives from other industries. With Germany facing an ever-growing shortage of skilled workers, there are plenty of opportunities out there for those willing to be flexible. Many companies are moving toward skills-based hiring: hiring practices that value practical skills over formal qualifications. "In 2026, for the first time, fewer people will be entering the labour market in Germany than leaving it," said economist Probst. "This is another reason why skills are becoming more important than formal qualifications." International workers are needed Speaking of the labour shortage, 2026 will also see red tape eased in a bid to attract foreigners with in-demand skills to Germany. The new Work and Stay Agency, due to launch this year and be implemented over the coming years, is expected to offer faster procedures, clearer guidance and a single point of contact for people looking to live and work in the country. Billed as a “one-stop government”, it will link visa offices, the Federal Employment Agency and local immigration authorities. The coalition government initiative is a response to Germany’s shifting demographics, as a wave of retirements shrinks the workforce and deepens pressure on the economy and social security system. READ ALSO: The planned changes to immigration and citizenship in Germany in 2026 Wages are rising and becoming more transparent In January, Germany's minimum wage rose by 8.4 percent. "This is having a particular impact in low-wage sectors such as catering and agriculture," said Weber. And even employees who earn more can expect an increase, albeit a small one. "Wages have recently risen by almost five percent. However, the increase will be smaller because the economic situation is difficult and the days of high inflation compensation are over," added Weber. Wage transparency will also be an important issue in 2026. EU member states must implement the EU Pay Transparency Directive into national law by June 7th, 2026. German companies need to catch up. Employers will soon have to tell applicants the starting salary or salary range either in the job ad or before the first interview. Employees can also request information about their individual pay and the average pay for comparable jobs (broken down by gender).

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years. The AI boom hasn’t quite managed that—it has experienced a gain of around 130 percent over the past three years—but three years is already longer than most of these historic booms. If AI is a bubble that’s going to bust, then it’s almost past due going by historic trends. All the major AI companies have announced their deals and are starting to make them reality. We aren’t going to see new rounds of trillion-dollar deals from even the major tech firms, as even they have limits on the capital they have available to them. But scaling up to these grandiose goals of AI data centers all over the world is proving difficult. After buying up all the GPUs and memory they can, some of these companies are still struggling to bring them online. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in November that the company now had a power problem, meaning it had GPUs that couldn’t physically plug in because it lacked the power to run them. And then you have Elon Musk’s xAI trying to import a power station (no, really) and supersonic jet company Boom Supersonic converting its jet engines into gas generators (no, really!). AI needs power, but power is at a premium. Power stations and their associated grid infrastructures take years or even decades to build. When power supply fails to catch up to their ambitions, it’s going to slam the brakes on expansion. A slowdown like that is the last thing the AI industry needs to keep its hype train rolling. No one likes Grok’s deepfakes and child exploitation images. Fake frames in Nvidia-run games are making gamers feel like they’re not really playing their games. AI-driven memory shortages and associated price spikes for everyday tech products are driving people crazy. Dell Companies are noticing and already pivoting, too. The most stark example so far this year is Dell relaunching its XPS brand at CES 2026. Sure, it’s still a “Copilot+ PC,” but you’d never know it from the marketing. AI is gone from the forefront and back is the focus on longevity, everyday performance, and lightweight design—you know, the things that consumers actually care about. If no one’s even interested in buying AI, how are these companies ever going to make it profitable? That’s not something investors are going to want to see or hear this year. On top of all the internal AI industry factors that could bring about its fall, there’s also global instability that could just as likely to deal a death blow. The US administration’s volatile leadership keeps throwing up (and tearing down) trade barriers. Hardware nationalization and nationalism are driving secular investments rather than global branch-outs. TSMC And as the superpowers keep eyeing up what their neighbors have, there’s the risk of war stalling out the world economy. Just China closing off Taiwan’s access to global markets would be enough to collapse just about everything in the tech sphere. Hopefully nothing like that comes to pass, but the prospect of it is one more Sword of Damocles hanging over the AI industry. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft won’t collapse. OpenAI probably won’t collapse. But the AI hype train of today could be heavily derailed. The smaller and medium AI companies, and all the firms promising agentic revolutions for your business? They’ll be gone. Stock prices will collapse, and global recession could be the medium-term fallout that eventually corrects everything back to some semblance of normalcy. Long term, though, even the companies that remain will have to contend with hardware deprecation that’ll see them scurrying back to Nvidia every 2 to 3 years. Even with all that hardware power, none of these companies are going to reach AGI (or even super-intelligence) with large language models that can’t functionally understand anything. AI is here to stay, but the industry as it is can’t last much longer. The signs are there that 2026 could be the year it all changes—again.

Macy's will close two fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, eliminating nearly 1,000 jobs by August 2026. The closures are part of a broader corporate strategy to streamline operations and centralize functions.

Local and state agencies are coordinating job fairs and transition resources for displaced workers.

The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. In a significant restructuring of its logistics network, the iconic American retailer Macyâs Inc. will shutter two major fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, resulting in the permanent elimination of nearly 1,000 jobs. The phased layoffs, set to begin in March and conclude by late August 2026, deliver a severe economic blow to a community where the department store chain has been a cornerstone employer for four decades. This decision underscores the persistent pressures on traditional retail as companies aggressively streamline supply chains to improve profitability in an era dominated by e-commerce and shifting consumer habits. The scope of the Cheshire closure According to official notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the closures will affect 993 employees at facilities on Knotter Drive and West Johnson Avenue. The job cuts will occur in waves, starting with night operations and talent acquisition personnel on March 14, 2026. Subsequent rounds will impact part-time and full-time weekend and day-shift workers through the spring and summer, with a final group, including maintenance staff, ending employment on Aug. 29, 2026. A small maintenance team will remain until spring 2027 to manage the decommissioning process. Macyâs stated it will offer severance, benefits information and the possibility of transfers to other locations for affected workers. A decades-long community anchor is removed The human and economic impact extends far beyond the corporate balance sheet. Town officials expressed profound disappointment, noting Macyâs has been one of Cheshireâs top ten employers since it opened the fulfillment center in 1986. The town is collaborating with the Northwest Regional Workforce Board and the Connecticut Department of Labor to organize a job fair and provide transition resources for the displaced workforce. The ripple effect is already felt by local businesses, such as nearby restaurants and shops that have relied on Macyâs employees as regular customers for generations. Part of a broader corporate contraction The Cheshire shutdown is not an isolated event. It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition. The evolution of retail logistics The consolidation of distribution networks reflects a pivotal moment in retail history. For decades, large department stores like Macyâs operated extensive networks of regional fulfillment and distribution centers to stock physical stores efficiently. The rise of e-commerce giants, led by Amazon, revolutionized consumer expectations for delivery speed, forcing traditional retailers to overhaul their logistics models. Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities. Navigating the transition As the layoffs proceed, the focus in Connecticut turns to mitigation. The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement. The planned job fair and access to retraining programs will be vital for workers whose skills are specialized to warehouse and logistics operations. The outcome in Cheshire will serve as a case study for how regional economies can respond to the ongoing structural changes in the retail and logistics sectors. An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept. Few are going to miss it. As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices. In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more. Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets. Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well. The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers. Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending. Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate. That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments. Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores. “This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.” He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030. Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size. Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity. From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta. For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.) But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more. Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely. In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior. At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached. These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.” Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!) Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.) With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, said Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in 2025. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The health care sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create among the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, told Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson said. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

Title: Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicks off reelection campaign

Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicked off a 2026 reelection bid in Charlestown on Sunday — defending his record, speaking to the future and warning his opponent that Teamsters politics are a “full contact sport.” “We need a full court press going into Las Vegas in June,” said O’Brien to a lively packed crowd of supporters. “We’re going to send a message. Send a message that we are united, and we are ready to fight. And our opponents need to understand, it’s a full contact sport. They need to put the helmets on and buckle the chinstraps. It’s gonna be a long game.” O’Brien, who was elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a five year term in 2022, is running for reelection along with Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. The incumbents face a challenge from Philadelphia-based head of Teamsters local 623 Richard Hooker Jr., and his “Fearless 2026” slate. Candidates need at least 5% of delegates at a Teamsters convention in June to advance to the November election. O’Brien held his kick-off rally at the Knights of Columbus in Charlestown at noon Sunday, cheered on by a hometown crowd. The president highlighted his accomplishments over his five years in office, including organizing over 90,000 new members — noting he hopes to hit 100,000 by the end of 2026 — securing financial stability for members on strike, making sure no contract can be implemented that members vote down and ensuring rank and file members a seat at bargaining tables. “There is no union that is doing what we’re doing,” O’Brien said. “We negotiated the largest settlement and the largest collective bargaining agreement in the entire country. When people didn’t think we could do it, we got a $30 million deal. We negotiated the strongest contracts in the food service, in the rubbish, in the airline, in every single every single division we represent.” O’Brien also came at Hooker directly, saying “if you listen to him, you think he’s running against Donald Trump, not Sean O’Brien.” Hooker has been a vocal critic of the relationship between Trump and O’Brien, who met privately with the president and spoke at the Republican national convention ahead of his election. “He has not discussed one platform of what he’s going to do to improve this union,” O’Brien said, accusing the challenger of only organizing two contracts. In response to the rally, the Hooker campaign contended the candidate has negotiated five contracts, with two being first time contracts, since being elected in 2020. “Our campaign has explicitly talked about member power and how plan on giving it to them,” the Hooker campaign said. … “One of the campaign platforms is to lower the per capita revenue the international union receives so local unions can survive. With so many layoffs and building closures happening in our ranks, local union will lose resources to fight against employers. Without the resources, local unions will have a difficult time to organize new workers.” O’Brien noted the goal is to make sure the opposition does not even advance to the November ballot. “Of course, why wouldn’t you want to run when the pensions are fixed, when the strike benefit at its highest, when membership continues to grow,” said O’Brien. “F—, that’s pretty easy, isn’t it, to walk in, but we’re not going to look back. We’re going to look forward.” The president spoke to continued “trials and tribulations” ahead of the union, calling Amazon the “largest white collar crime syndicate in the world.” “They’re represented in every single division we represent,” said O’Brien. “They’re our biggest threat. And by us getting the strongest contracts in each in all divisions, we are empowering the non-union to look at what we’re achieving.” The crowd was enthusiastically supportive of O’Brien and Zuckerman Sunday, packing into the event space and cheering loudly. O’Brien called the rally the largest attended union meeting in five years. “We’re going to keep going to every state, every city,” said O’Brien. “Make sure that we’re getting our message out there, make sure we’re talking to members, make sure they’re included and make sure we’re transparent about what our agenda is moving forward for the next five years, and just execute it.”

Title: Fortune 100 companies are back in the office — but 'work from home dark matter' is thriving under the radar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows. Think of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies. As of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL. However, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Bloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as "work-from-home dark matter" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar. "We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data," he said. For companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize.

Bloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up. Bloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers. Additionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are "off the record" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval. Bloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility. "Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs," he said, adding, "Managers ultimately care about their team performance." One of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an "off-the-record" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Not every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey. Loewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported. Bloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital. The survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility. A report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Leslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," said Snipes, who's in her 30s. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." In addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices. Some employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to "coffee badging," the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements. If a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility. Amid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work. "Work from home is here to stay," he said. "But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record." Juliana Kaplan contributed to this story. Jump to
