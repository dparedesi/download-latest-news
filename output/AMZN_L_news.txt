Title: Dear CTO: it's not 2015 anymore

Engineers have been spoiled rotten for the last two decades. It’s the harsh - but objective - truth. Pre-2022, twenty-somethings regularly landed 6-figure jobs with nothing but a boot camp on their resumes. Big Tech employers offered unlimited PTO, ‘20% time’, and lavish benefits - ex: private gyms, gourmet cafeterias, and on-campus childcare. Job security was a given; recruiters constantly swarmed engineers with offers of more: better benefits, bigger salaries, and higher titles. If you were lucky enough to be considered tech talent, there was virtually no way to fail. You could get fired for your own incompetence and find a new role within weeks - with a better title and salary to boot. There was an ulterior motive behind all this. Engineers fueled the software boom. It was an advantage for Google to hoard 60,000 ICs. The point was not to put them all to work, but just to have them; it bought optionality while keeping critical resourcing away from their competitors. The downstream effect of this would transform engineering as a function. If you (like most companies) couldn’t afford the $350k price tag of a senior dev, you only had one option to attract top talent: Build a ‘great engineering culture’ In other words, a culture where engineers don’t need to do anything that they don’t want to do. Engineers don’t like politics, so product management transforms into a glorified mouthpiece, running interference and smoothing things over with unhappy stakeholders. Dev time is precious, so bureaucracy is put in place to ensure that requests are screened before engineers ever need to lift a finger. Developer sentiment surveys are distributed regularly to make sure that the tech team knows their feelings very, very important. No other function is run this way, but it’s business as usual for engineering. It was for good reason - retention was critically important; losing your ICs (who were constantly solicited by Big Tech recruiters offering them bigger and better) meant you might not be able to keep the lights on. Two decades of this arms race has birthed an extraordinary phenomenon: we have an entire generation of engineering leaders who think that hiring and retention is the point. They coddle rather than manage, disdain and avoid corporate politics, and fail to prioritize the bottom line. This isn’t universally true of all engineering leaders, but these norms pervade engineering culture. Engineering has operated under unique circumstances for so long that most CTOs have never experienced a ‘normal’ business environment. They think priorities can be set on trust and good faith. They mistake developer experience metrics for ‘productivity’ indicators. They think that the product team sharing a roadmap should be enough to explain what engineering is working on. They’ve been so hyper-focused on retaining their teams and staying alive that they’ve never had to justify their existence. But these leaders don’t realize that the days of focusing on retention are over. Software ate the world, and there’s no longer a point for Google to hoard 60,000 engineers. In 2023, Big Tech unceremoniously laid off 250,000+ workers and slashed benefits left and right. The promise of AI put the nail on the coffin: the party is over, and it’s not coming back. This transition is gearing up to be a painful one for CTOs and their teams. Their C-Suite peers are looking at the massive cuts organizations like Google and Amazon were able to successfully make and wondering if they could do the same. This wouldn’t be a problem in any other function; you don’t read about JetBlue making cuts to their marketing budget and immediately wonder if you could also cut your ad spend. But engineering has a unique problem because no one really knows what engineers actually do all day. I'm including this in a pull quote to re-emphasize how weird this is: most leaders have little to no visibility into one of their business's most expensive and important core functions. There are a couple of compounding factors that got us to this point. To start, engineering just isn’t widely understood as a function. In business school, you learn about product positioning and operations, but nothing about maintaining InfoSec as strategic infrastructure. There’s just no good way for non-technical leaders to build even a basic mental model of how enterprise engineering works. This makes conversations between technical and non-technical leaders uniquely painful. Virtually every conversation requires explaining foundational principles. Imagine if the CMO, before, during, and after a proposal on a routine ad campaign, needed to explain the concept of brand, why demand generation is important, and why we run ads. It’s so bad that most engineering leaders quietly handle routine engineering tasks behind the scenes. It’s much easier to just get their team through a major update than explain [common example of maintenance that non-tech person is likely to have never heard of]. This creates an us vs. them schism between engineering and virtually every other part of the business. Engineering feels (rightly) that they aren’t understood and appreciated. The rest of the business feels (rightly) that they’re dealing with a withholding, black box. Their conversations become increasingly hostile, to the point where engineering leaders - who were often raised in environments where it was perfectly okay to avoid things they didn’t like - stop trying to explain themselves at all. In many orgs, it’s product management that ends up picking up the slack. They act as a soothing balm - building bridges on engineering’s behalf and helping explain the what, why, and how behind engineering decisions. It’s no wonder that, when someone asks what engineering is doing, the answer is usually the product roadmap. This has become the norm for many companies. And this is why it’s going to hurt like hell for engineering leaders as they navigate this era of streamlining: Engineering leaders have never had control over their own narrative. Owning your narrative is essential to playing politics. Good narratives make goals feel natural and inevitable. They help leaders get everyone - not just those they manage - excited about achieving them. They provide air cover when things get tough and kudos when things go right. Engineering teams don’t have this. At best, they have a roadmap—a literal wishlist of things that product management would like them to do. This is why most CEOs have no concept of the life-preserving maintenance activities their engineering teams do every day. They don’t know when refactors happen and why. They don’t understand when bottlenecks occur because they don’t know where critical institutional knowledge is held. In short, they can’t see the work that engineers do. Engineering feels like an expensive, entitled black box that magically delivers features. This would be bad on its own, but nature abhors a vacuum. Engineering isn’t in the driver’s seat, but it still has a narrative. Engineers are socially inept nerds. Their work is cold, sterile, and binary. They don’t understand business and have no place in the boardroom. We can’t put them in front of investors and customers. They play foosball and drink beer all day. This is how people have come to see engineers. Imagine a head of support (who brings home $120k a year after two decades of leading call centers), watching a bunch of twenty-somethings play ping-pong at 4 p.m. Engineers might have been needed, but they were only barely tolerated. This is why FAANG making cuts has been such a galvanizing force for completely unrelated companies to begin layoffs of their own. People just can’t wait to believe that engineers aren’t so damn precious anymore. Enter the fierce debates we now see on ‘developer productivity’; they’re chomping at the bit to rightsize their engineering teams. This is the existential threat that CTOs now face. The scary thing is that most of them don’t even realize it - they’re still operating like it’s 2015, where the goal is hiring and retention. They’re strolling into conversations with their CFOs on ‘productivity’ with developer sentiment surveys in hand. Their teams are sitting ducks. It’s painful to watch. The irony of it all is that most engineering organizations outside of big-tech are already lean. Tech talent has been so expensive that most leaders outside of FAANG have learned to do a lot with very little. When over-eager business stakeholders make misguided cuts, they inadvertently put business continuity at risk by cutting core infrastructure. This infrastructure - and the developers who built it - enabled the prosperity of the software boom. Software engineers might have enjoyed extraordinary privilege along the way, but it was for a job well done. Take a look at Big Tech’s stock performance over the last two decades; you could easily argue that these workers deserved even more. Other functions would do well to bring the same kind of focus on enabling productivity, happiness, and autonomy to their workers. In fact, CTOs-turned-CEOs I know tend to be some of the most kind, creative, and abundance-minded leaders I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. They have an inherent understanding on the importance of culture and making people feel valued. But they - and their teams - won’t survive if they keep their heads in the sand. Just in this article, I probably made you feel all sorts of emotions about engineers. I did nothing to change your lived experiences; I just organized my thoughts, chose words carefully, and added necessary context. That’s the power of narrative. Good ones ring as truth because they help explain and reinforce our own experiences. That’s why it’s so important for engineering leaders to acknowledge that times have changed. If they don’t, it’s not just their teams and careers at stake - but the very continuity of the businesses they worked so hard to build. Are engineers a bunch of spoiled, overpaid geeks who were long overdue for a reckoning? Or are they the core infrastructure of revenue & innovation that we could all learn from? Whether or not CTOs choose to step up will make all the difference. After all, if you won’t write your story, someone else will. Godfrey helps CTO write their stories and bring people together. It tells the full story of what engineering teams do every day by visualizing maintenance, resourcing, and architecture in an easy, intuitive way. It’s Learn More A huge thank you to Matthew Casey, Sofia Hou, Mike Morreale, and Evan Kozliner for reading and proofing versions of this. I agree with a lot of what your article mentions. It does seem though that you think that the entire engineering population are just a bunch of spoiled overpaid 20 years-old with no developed communication skills since they didn't "need it". If this is the core point you are making then I am not sure if you are better than the average engineer that seems to think that everyone is stupid and not doing enough. Some great points in this article, which I'm sure will unfortunately not be read by the people who most need to read it. Two notes: 1) The system will bounce back. It always does, except for the collapse of an industry, which despite the AI boom, this is not. Engineers are still needed, but as noted in the article, this is not fully recognized. When engineers are fired en masse and stability starts to tank in 1 - 5 years, industry will reverse course. The engineer's duty is to weather the storm, and the team lead / technical manager's duty is to attempt (possibly futilely) to make the case to the top leadership, as discussed in the article somewhat. 2) Some engineers are, or become, dead weight. This is not denigration towards engineering -- it's true in all sectors. It just happens to be more true in areas where hiring, and protection from firing, has been above par. In other words, industry has stocked many engineers, many of whom have been more or less coveted. It is inevitable that some will be more "competent" than others (using that term loosely, since it is very context dependent, and changes across jobs, cultures, and more). In a meritocracy, we hope that we can do the work of keeping the ones who "deserve" it in their jobs (again, using that term loosely and without intent to inaccurately ascribe incompetence to those who simply struggle in a particular context).

Title: Why and How Lenovo Is Outpacing the Competition in AI
URL: https://www.technewsworld.com/story/why-and-how-lenovo-is-outpacing-the-competition-in-ai-179428.html
Time Published: 2024-10-21T12:00:13Z
Full Content:
On paper, Lenovo Group and Dell Technologies are remarkably alike, but the two companies are organized and run differently. That will become clear to most who compare last week’s Lenovo Tech World 2024 event to Dell’s similar event next month. At the heart of the difference is the nature of both companies’ acquisitions and executive leadership. Lenovo’s leadership is geographically diverse, making it a truly global company, while Dell’s is primarily centralized in the U.S. Although Michael Dell was instrumental in the company’s growth, he appears to have almost retired in place. Meanwhile, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, known as YY, is still a vibrant part of the company’s management. This difference allows Lenovo to move much more decisively on industry changes, while Dell appears unable to make big moves and has to undergo massive layoffs to make the same pivot to AI that Lenovo has already made. Another difference is the extent to which Lenovo is using AI. It’s already using AI operationally and selling mature AI solutions, while Dell still appears stuck on trying to sell a concept that the firm does not seem to know how to use yet. Dell’s marketing is doing a decent job of covering for these shortcomings, but the layoffs imply most customers are not fooled. Let’s discuss some of the highlights from Lenovo Tech World 2024. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, an interesting, mechanized laptop that Lenovo highlighted at the event. In the opening moments of an event like this, you can often see where a company’s heart and focus are. It might do something humorous or feature the leading offering, but occasionally, I am surprised, and this was one of those times. Lenovo opened with a demonstration featuring an individual with advanced ALS who cannot speak and can only move her eyes. But Lenovo had fashioned an AI solution for her so that, using AI, she could talk again. This breakthrough is monumental for individuals with ALS, enabling both speech and online interaction. This demonstration was incredibly powerful, and Lenovo followed up by covering what it’s doing for education with AI. Education is interesting because while it enormously impacts the world, the segment is not very profitable. Personalized learning for students using AI could be a massive benefit, as it should better engage those students and significantly increase the effectiveness of education across all demographics. Automated AI quizzes coupled with classes that teach using multiple AIs to create more compelling documents and reports should far better prepare students for the AI future than any other existing curriculum. Both things told me that Lenovo is more about making a difference than making a profit, which is incredibly important when talking about a technology that could eliminate many jobs. Lenovo made it clear that it is not working on AI to replace people but as a tool that would make students, people with disabilities, and employees more valuable rather than redundant over time. This approach stands in stark contrast to Dell’s recent AI-related layoffs. One of the more interesting offerings at the event was the Lenovo AI Library. Most companies are nowhere near as advanced as Lenovo in using AI. However, Lenovo’s journey to AI has created a massive amount of information. The company has now placed it in a library that can help its customers gain the insights they need to make informed AI solutions. Too many vendors are marketing AI as if it were an end in itself, similar to how digital transformation was once promoted rather than a tool to achieve specific business goals. This should ensure that Lenovo’s customers succeed while most other efforts are still, unfortunately, incurring significant failures. Where Lenovo stands out when it comes to these efforts is the blending of multiple AIs into a solution. Like people, AIs are not all equal and are best suited for the tasks they were designed to handle. However, many projects require diverse skills, often necessitating using multiple AI systems for successful completion. Lenovo’s hybrid AI approach is unique in recognizing this, offering greater real-world benefits and a higher likelihood of success. One example of this was the Lenovo AI paralegal. My wife and I are watching the old TV show “Suits,” which does a surprisingly excellent job of pointing out the critical nature of paralegals. These people are overworked, and much of what they do requires massive amounts of research, where a mistake can make the difference between winning and losing a case. Another powerful example was using AI for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy. Qualified ABA practitioners are expensive, and only relatively wealthy children have access to this type of therapy, which is increasingly critical given how much damage social media tools like TikTok are doing to them. The use of AI in this context could tremendously reduce the growing depression and behavioral problems today’s kids are suffering. Lenovo has long had a robust partnering culture. Most OEMs are at arm’s length from their technology suppliers, and our industry is famous for vendor conflict. Lenovo collaborates surprisingly closely with its suppliers, which has paid dividends in the past with workstations. Lenovo uniquely adopted AMD’s Threadripper and almost immediately took workstation leadership. Today, Lenovo’s closeness with Nvidia is what has paid off. Lenovo showcased what is arguably the best Nvidia Blackwell solution, which is cooled with Lenovo’s 6th-generation warm-water cooling technology, Neptune. Blackwell is incredibly powerful but also uses a lot of power and generates a great deal of heat. Neptune cools the part cost-effectively, which addresses two of the shortcomings associated with a part in this class. Neptune is today’s most widely used and efficient cooling technology for data centers. Over a decade ago, Dell predicted at Dell World that robotics would become the next big thing for enterprises. Autonomous vehicles have since emerged as the leading class of autonomous robots, with other types of robots also developing. This year, Lenovo reinforced this idea by showcasing current solutions, while Dell has yet to follow through on its prediction. Working with Nvidia, Lenovo showcased a Blackwell-based drive solution for cars with 2000 TOPS (Trillions or Tera Operations per Second). High-performance AI PCs have only 40 TOPS. Dell looked at doing this over five years ago but never executed a growing problem with that company due to a lack of clear leadership and willingness to take critical risks. Lenovo also highlighted its version of the autonomous robotic dog. Other firms have advanced robotic dogs, but Lenovo is the first in its class to do this. Lenovo’s 6-legged robot displayed at Tech World 2024 (Photo by Author) In addition, while Lenovo is not yet using Nvidia’s Omniverse for simulation training (it tends to leave training up to the customer), Lenovo is already anticipating that use, moving it toward the front of the line for automobile and autonomous robotic training. Occasionally, an OEM surprises me, but I’ve been disappointed by how companies like Dell have approached AI sales and deployment to date. Many are not yet using AI extensively themselves and, as a result, lack the understanding needed to drive successful implementations. Lenovo, however, isn’t just pushing AI; it’s offering complete AI solutions — from education to robotics — positioning itself and its customers for the future of AI. For me, it was the work in education that I found to be the most compelling. Technology is doing massive harm to kids now, and we need to prioritize technological solutions to address this critical problem. I found a kindred heart in Lenovo; its focus here could save many kids from uncertain futures. (Photo by Author) I typically put products you can buy in this section, but I was so impressed with this concept that I am making an exception this week. I have an expensive automotive hobby, and I often watch videos on how to do this while working on my cars. The problem is that seeing the screen as I move around the vehicle usually requires that I reposition the tablet or PC several times, but my hands are greasy and can make a mess of that hardware, not to mention that there are times when my hands are otherwise engaged. The ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept looks like a regular laptop, but the screen rotates to follow you around the room. So, if you are cooking, working on a project (like a car), or otherwise moving around, the screen automatically moves to follow you. This demo video is pretty cool: One of the Amazon Alexa versions did this a few years ago, and I found it incredibly useful, but the device always had to be plugged in. Plus, Alexa’s capabilities limited it, and since Alexa isn’t a PC, it couldn’t access the videos I wanted to watch. The PC that Nvidia is secretly working on will take this concept further (and may not even need an OS like Windows), but the ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept comes closer to what I think it will be than anything else I have seen. This thing is awesome, so it’s my Product of the Week. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

Canada needs rigorous, deeply reported independent journalism now more than ever. Go to canadaland.com/join to become a yearly Canadaland Supporter today and get three months of perks and benefits for free. You can't really call Regina a news desert. They still have a newspaper. But if you actually look under the hood you’ll discover that they stopped printing the newspaper in Regina. They stopped editing it in Regina. The editor lives somewhere else. And as far the CBC goes, well, that acronym is now synonymous with layoffs. Everyone from the legacy media who purports to be telling people in Regina what is going on in their own community is doing so with less resources than ever before. These are zombie news organizations. That creates a news vacuum. A place for someone new to step in. And somebody did. And that somebody peddles garbage. That's not a value judgment of this new news source in Regina. It's just the objective truth. They're a garbage company called Just Bins. They provide dumpsters and news to the people of Regina. And they may be providing news to more people in Regina than anyone else.

Title: Amazon employees gripe about their work culture on social media
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/amazon-employees-complaints-work-culture-return-to-office-mandate-andy-jassy/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T14:32:34Z

Amazon.com Inc. workers’ complaints about company culture — a frequent sight on anonymous and internal forums — turned public this week with a popular LinkedIn post that struck a chord with current employees. The post, by former Amazon worker Stephanie Ramos, criticized bureaucracy at the company. “Instead of the exciting, fast-paced environment I remember, I experienced a place bogged down in pointless meetings and middling middle managers,” wrote Ramos, explaining why she quit her job less than three months after being rehired by Amazon. Ramos posted her thoughts Monday afternoon. By the end of the week, more than 100,000 people had viewed it, she said in an interview. Of the more than 200 people who commented on her post, about 20 are currently employed by Amazon in various departments around the world – and many were critical of the company. Some lambasted Amazon’s direction under Andy Jassy, who assumed the chief executive officer role from co-founder Jeff Bezos three years ago. “Love him or hate him, Bezos had courage and a vision — he had real all-hands meetings that weren’t prerecorded with hard questions,” wrote Todd Leonhardt, whose LinkedIn profile describes him as an Amazon Web Services software developer in Virginia. Another person, Laura Barry, whose LinkedIn profile says she’s worked at Amazon for nearly 20 years, wrote that the company today reminded her of a bank. She pointed to the new policy of requiring workers to be in the office five days a week. “I’m waiting for a dress code to be implemented after 5 days a week starts,” she commented on the post. “Hide those tattoos!” Employee complaints are common at any company, but the public forum made this week’s outpouring on LinkedIn unusual. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan declined to address the specific criticisms lobbed by employees. She noted that Amazon ranked second this year in LinkedIn’s Top Companies list, a ranking of the 50 best large workplaces compiled using LinkedIn data on such things as promotions. JPMorgan Chase & Co. topped the list. Jassy’s tenure has been defined by layoffs and cost cutting — moves that pleased Wall Street investors but rankled some staff. The executive also openly criticized the company culture himself in a memo to employees in September, when he announced that the five-day policy would begin in January. Jassy said he intended to cut management layers that were slowing the company down and the return-to-office plan would help Amazon rekindle its defining culture. The announcement prompted backlash, but much of it was contained to anonymous forums such as Blind, where employees can complain under pseudonyms. Ramos, the original poster, previously worked for the company for six years as a logistics project manager before getting laid off in 2023. This year, she was rehired, but decided to quit. She didn’t mind the return to the office, she wrote, but was frustrated by the culture. She was initially nervous about posting her thoughts, but felt a sense of solidarity with her former colleagues when she saw the reactions accumulate, Ramos said. “I’m not alone,” she said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: ‘Pointless meetings, middling middle managers’: Amazon employees air workplace complaints in viral LinkedIn post

Employee frustrations with Amazon’s culture, usually confined to internal forums, spilled into the public eye this week through a viral LinkedIn post that struck a chord with many current and former employees. Stephanie Ramos, a former Amazon employee, criticised the company’s growing bureaucracy in her post. "Instead of the exciting, fast-paced environment I remember, I experienced a place bogged down in pointless meetings and middling middle managers,” Ramos wrote, explaining why she quit just three months after being rehired. The post, shared on Monday, quickly gained traction. By the end of the week, it had attracted over 100,000 views and more than 200 comments. Around 20 commenters identified as current Amazon employees from various departments, many expressing similar frustrations. Some criticisms were directed at CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021. “Love him or hate him, Bezos had courage and a vision — he had real all-hands meetings that weren’t prerecorded with hard questions,” wrote Todd Leonhardt, an Amazon Web Services developer based in Virginia. Laura Barry, a nearly 20-year Amazon employee, compared the current work environment to that of a bank, citing the new policy requiring employees to return to the office five days a week. “I’m waiting for a dress code to be implemented after 5 days a week starts,” she joked. “Hide those tattoos!," as quoted by Bloomberg. While employee gripes are common at large companies, the public nature of this week’s LinkedIn discussions stood out. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan declined to comment on specific criticisms but noted that Amazon placed second in LinkedIn’s 2024 Top Companies list, trailing JPMorgan Chase, as per a report by Bloomberg. Jassy’s leadership has been marked by cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, which have pleased investors but upset some employees. In a September memo, Jassy himself criticized the company’s structure, saying that additional management layers had slowed progress. He argued that the five-day office return policy, starting in January 2024, would help restore Amazon’s fast-paced culture, the report added. Most employee backlash to the return-to-office mandate had previously remained on anonymous platforms like Blind. Ramos, however, decided to go public. Ramos, who worked at Amazon for six years before being laid off in 2023, was rehired earlier this year but left after finding the culture frustrating. Although she didn’t oppose the return-to-office requirement, the internal environment made her decide to quit, as per the report. Initially hesitant to post her thoughts, Ramos said she felt relieved when others responded to her post. "I’m not alone,” she said.

Title: Jeff Shultz, Paramount’s Streaming Strategy Chief, Is Exiting
URL: https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/jeff-shultz-paramount-streaming-out-1236182626/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Jeff Shultz, who has served as chief strategy officer and chief business development officer of Paramount Global‘s streaming division, is leaving the company at the end of the year. Shultz joined Paramount in 2019 as part of the acquisition of Pluto TV and was a key executive on the leadership team that launched and grew the Paramount+ subscription service. He has overseen strategy, distribution and business development for both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Shultz announced that he will leave Paramount Global in a post Friday on LinkedIn. “To my colleagues at Paramount Streaming, writing this incredible story with you has been the honor of my career,” he wrote. “I’m sorry I won’t be with you for the next chapter, but I can’t wait to see where you go from here.” Related Stories VIP+ ‘Hacks’ Post-Emmys Boost Highlights Max’s HBO Problem Disney World, Universal Orlando Theme Park to Close as Florida Braces for Hurricane Milton Paramount is expanding the role of Ray Hopkins, president of U.S. networks distribution, to now include streaming and linear partners/distribution, the company’s three co-CEOs — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — announced in an internal memo Friday. As a result of this shift, Shultz “will be departing the organization and the Streaming [distribution and business development] team will now transition under Ray,” the execs said in the memo. Popular on Variety In July, Paramount Global and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone clinched a deal to merge Paramount with Skydance Media, a transaction expected to close in the first half of 2025. In the meantime, Paramount has engaged in layoffs and restructuring in its U.S. workforce aimed at slashing 15% of its domestic headcount. Separately Friday, Paramount disclosed that Charles Phillips Jr., who led the board’s special committee on M&A that ultimately reached a deal to merge the company with Skydance, is exiting the board of directors. Shultz joined Pluto TV as chief business officer in early 2018, after serving as an adviser to the free, ad-supported streaming startup for three years. A year later, Viacom acquired the free, ad-supported streaming startup for $340 million. Tom Ryan, former CEO of Pluto TV, is now CEO of Paramount Streaming. Ryan, in a comment on Shultz’s LinkedIn post, said: “Jeff, thank you for everything you have done for Paramount Streaming. Pluto TV and Paramount+ would never have come so far so fast without your talent, drive, optimism and collaboration. We will be forever grateful for your immense contributions and you will be sorely missed.” “Six and a half years ago, celebrating the acquisition of Pluto TV by Viacom with the team in Santa Barbara, I gave a toast recognizing the moment that concluded: ‘We’re just getting started,'” Shultz wrote in the LinkedIn post. “Despite all we have accomplished since then, I still feel the same way. So with mixed emotions I share that I will be leaving Paramount later this year.” Shultz touted deals that he cut for Pluto TV’s service, including with the NFL, Major League Baseball, Warner Bros. Discovery, A+E Networks, AMC Networks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, MGM, Fremantle and Banijay Entertainment. Under his leadership, Pluto TV also inked partnership deals with Amazon, Roku, Google, Apple, T-Mobile, Verizon, Comcast, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Vizio and more. In 2019, the year Viacom acquired Pluto TV, the free streamer generated about $70 million in revenue; three years later, “Pluto TV was a billion-dollar business,” according to Shultz. In 2021, the company rebranded CBS All Access as Paramount+ to create the Paramount Streaming division. In the second quarter of 2024, the division reported revenue of $1.9 billion, representing one-fourth of Paramount Global revenue. Prior to Pluto TV, Shultz held senior leadership roles in digital business development at media companies including NBC and CBS, and internet TV startups Clicker and Concert TV, which he co-founded. In 2022, Shultz was named to Variety’s Dealmaker Impact Report. He began his career as a lawyer for Linklaters in London after earning a law degree from Georgetown University. In his LinkedIn post, Shultz said he was “deeply grateful for the leadership and friendship of Tom Ryan, and the partnership and excellence of the Paramount Streaming leadership team Elizabeth Wright, Domenic DiMeglio, Jeff Grossman, Amy Kuessner, Olivier Jollet, Marco Nobili, Erin Calhoun, and Abhinav Chopra.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Data centers try to cool it as AI explodes, and Big Tech goes nuclear
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/18/data-centers-try-cool-ai-explodes-big-tech-goes-nuclear/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:55:05Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 10:55 EDT / OCTOBER 18 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof What a turnaround for nuclear power — and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. This week two more Big Tech companies bet on nukes as Google and Amazon joined the party Microsoft started a few weeks ago. All that training of AI models takes a lot of power. And that’s despite, or because of, the fact that AI models are getting smaller and easier to use, as a raft of announcements this week made apparent. AI is also exploding the data center, as all the talk at the Open Compute Project’s Global Summit this week was about accommodating AI workloads — such as Crusoe’s plans for building an AI megafactory in Texas — and the massive increase in power, heat and networking needs they require. Indeed, as a result, networking is the not-so-new but now critical bottleneck in the data center. Companies such as Lightmatter and xScape Photonics are betting big on the opportunity. Paul Gillin lays out the very public Snowflake-Databricks clash in detail in the definitive story of the latest battle of the AI era. Ironically, given all the heat AI is producing, it’s about Apache Iceberg, the management layer that sits atop data files in cloud storage. Google shook up its management team, in particular in search and ads, as well as Gemini AI. It looks like DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has finally consolidated his hold on all things AI at Google. Down is up and up is down in the chip industry. In a hell-freezes-over moment, Intel and AMD decided to cooperate on standardizing the x86 chip instruction set. Meanwhile, TSMC and ASML issued widely different earnings results — chipmaker TSMC benefiting from roaring AI chip sales and equipment maker ASML suffering from a drop in sales to China and Samsung. Next week’s events include UiPath Forward and Celonis’ Celosphere, and we’ll have news and interviews on theCUBE from both. The enterprise earnings season kicks off with IBM, Seagate, SAP, ServiceNow, Pegasystems, Western Digital and Tesla, ahead of a much large number of reports the following two weeks from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and many others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend for some lean-back reading. Meantime, check out this past week’s installment, zeroing in on Microsoft’s much-debated Azure revenue and what it means for the overall cloud market. Here’s all of this week’s top news, newsy topics and analysis from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Big-data dust-up: Why two AI giants are at war over who is more open Accel says generative AI startups get 40% of VC investment in cloud OpenAI, Microsoft reportedly hire banks to renegotiate partnership terms Generative AI churns the waters at European NoCode Summit The next phase of AI: Unlocking explainability with causal intelligence Mistral introduces Ministral 3B and 8B AI computing models for phones and laptops AWS and Databricks to deliver more affordable generative AI for joint customers H2O.ai releases small language models for multimodal processing tasks LatticeFlow releases framework for checking LLMs’ compliance with the EU AI Act Google looks to spearhead AI adoption in the public sector DataStax merges its data stack with Nvidia’s development tools to simplify AI development and fine-tuning Adobe introduces new generative AI features for its creative applications Domino Data Lab seeks to embed governance in AI development Cognizant enhances Neuro AI platform for faster AI use case deployment OutSystems integrates generative AI with low-code to accelerate and simplify app development Big data startup UltiHash unveils advanced deduplication to boost AI storage efficiency Terray Therapeutics rakes in $120M for AI-powered small molecule drug development AI startups Decagon and Neuron7 raise millions to transform customer service and repairs AI observability firm Galileo raises $45M to improve AI model accuracy Omnea raises $25M to streamline procurement with AI French AI startup Gladia raises $16M and launches multilingual real-time transcription engine Data science and AI development platform Zerve raises $7.6M Simplismart raises $7M to help enterprises run their own AI models with rapid inference and full control Amplitude buys Command AI to help companies integrate AI-assisted onboarding and product tours into software There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Completing the cloud nuclear trifecta after Microsoft last month announced it will tap into a reopened Three Mile Island: Google to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactor startup Kairos Power and Amazon to invest in three nuclear energy projects But these are all going to take years to produce energy, so it’s not going to solve the data center energy crunch anytime soon. At the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, which focuses on new technologies and standards for data centers, the talk was all about how AI is changing everything in the data center, and creating new problems to solve: * Does it seem hot in here?: If there’s one thing everyone’s freaking out about, it’s heat — specifically the heat generated by servers full of chips from Nvidia and other AI accelerator chipmakers. There were dozens of companies offering liquid-cooling solutions, considerably more than last year if I remember correctly. “You can no longer air-cool these servers,” said Saurabh Dighe, corporate VP for Microsoft Azure strategic planning and architecture. They need to be liquid-cooled.” * But AI chips aren’t the only source of heat. Copper wire works fine in individual data center racks, but with AI forcing more racks to be connected to tackle training of huge AI models, optical interconnects are becoming more and more critical — and those interconnects currently also take a lot of power and produce a lot of heat. “We need to get the power down,” said Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder and chief architect of Arista Networks. “We cannot change the laws of physics, but we can come up with better connectors.” That’s something established companies and startups such as Lightspeed are working hard to do. * Sustainability was the other, closely related byword at the summit. One standard being mulled is how to use “all that warm water from [cooling] data centers for more than just letting it evaporate in the air,” said Supermicro VP of Solutions Thomas Garvens. * But the problem with standards is that they take a lot of meetings and back-and-forth to establish. “Standards can take more time than we have in the era of AI,” said Google Principal Engineer Amber Huffman. * By the way, if it weren’t apparent already, networking looks to be the biggest bottleneck in the AI era. “The networking is essentially becoming the computer,” said Sameh Boujelgene of market researcher Dell’Oro Group. * ”Pigs can fly”: AMD EVP Forrest Norrod used that phrase to describe a deal between AMD and Intel to create an x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, which although not an OCP project was revealed onstage at the summit by Norrod and Intel EVP Justin Hotard. If Intel weren’t in such a hole, this never would have happened, given the decades of legal and market battles between the two. But if either of them wants to challenge Arm, whose designs are now powering data center chips for cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft, they need an instruction set as unified as Arm’s to ensure software compatibility among Intel and AMD chips and keep developers on the x86 train. Our story: Intel and AMD team up to improve the x86 processor architecture There was lots of other news, honestly a lot of pretty arcane stuff, but no surprise that Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang insists all data centers must become “AI factories,” captured so much attention: Nvidia aims to boost Blackwell GPUs by donating platform design to the Open Compute Project And this startup is betting big on one ginormous factory: Crusoe’s $3.4B joint venture to build AI data center campus with up to 100,000 GPUs Breaking Analysis: What Microsoft’s financial disclosures reveal about Azure’s market position And it may force other big companies to reveal more about their AI revenue.

Title: AWS CEO Matt Garman says employees could quit if they don't want to come into office

Amazon AWS CEO Matt Garman has said that employees who don't want to abide by the new rules coming into force next year, which will see workers come in for five days a week, can resign. Garman didn't seem to be saying it in an antagonistic way, just that some people may not work well in the new environment, and if not, there are always other companies around that will let you work from home. Garman made the remarks yesterday during an all-hands meeting. He said that 90% of employees he had spoken to were on board with the new policy, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. He was quoted as saying: "If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around. By the way, I don't mean that in a bad way, we want to be in an environment where we're working together. When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in person." As you'd expect, not everyone at the company is thrilled about the idea of spending extra time commuting. Some people point to the fact that the benefits of working in the office aren't supported by independent data. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has been running a three-day-in-the-office policy where workers go into work for just three days a week. Garman said that the switch to being in the office five days a week will eliminate the issue of missing colleagues if they choose to work on different days. Going into the office five days a week is pretty much a return to the situation before the pandemic. Amazon believes that workers will get more done in the office so it's eager to get back to that. As many tech firms are doing layoffs, it will be unlikely that many people quit their Amazon jobs over this issue as it may be hard to get another job.

Title: Amazon boss has a brutal response to staffers who don’t like 5-day RTO mandate: Leave
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/amazon-matt-garman-return-to-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don’t like it, they can work elsewhere. At an all-hands meeting for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn’t like the controversial policy, they should leave. The tech giant’s push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn’t been simple. In February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy’s call to return to the office for “the majority of the week.” In February 2023, that meant only three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025. In an internal call this week—first reported by Reuters—Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn’t want employees who couldn’t handle being in the office that frequently. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said, per Reuters. “By the way, I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he continued. He said he wanted staff to be “in an environment where we’re working together.” Garman said he isn’t seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos–founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: “When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we’re not in-person.” Given the fact that teams were in for three days—and not necessarily the same three days—“we didn’t really accomplish anything, like, we didn’t get to work together and learn from each other,” Garman reportedly added. Amazon did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. According to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, “nine out of 10” are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced. Perhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing—impacting their commute and family dynamics. “Amazon has announced 5-day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,” the staffer continued. “Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face uncertain prospects, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure. Meta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Google has a similar policy. Microsoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high. Amazon’s culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm. Current CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person and full-time, is getting in the way of these guiding ideas. Speaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: “You can’t internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.” Along with well-known ideas like Amazon’s “customer obsession,” there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree. “I don’t know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,” Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. “It’s very hard.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta layoffs are the latest sign that constant job cuts are the new Big Tech normal
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-indicate-tech-companies-like-recurring-layoffs-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:12:02Z
Full Content:
The hashtag affixed to Andy Welfle's LinkedIn photo says it all: #sickofthisshit. Welfle wrote earlier this month that he was laid off from Microsoft after only nine months. He'd previously spent nine months at Cruise before being laid off. His dual layoffs might have been worse than what many others experienced, but Welfle is hardly alone in getting hit by what appears to be some employers' penchant for regular layoffs, particularly in Silicon Valley. One of the latest examples is Meta, which said on Wednesday that it was rejiggering some of its biggest businesses, resulting in lost jobs at Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp. It wasn't clear how many roles were eliminated. A Meta spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday that the company was looking for other positions for affected workers. After shedding workers in sweeping layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, many tech companies are taking a more methodical, department-by-department approach to making cuts. Major firms including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced sizable reductions followed by more modest trimming. Take Google. The tech giant's parent company, Alphabet, began 2023 by cutting some 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its workforce. It followed that with smaller reductions this year. Art Zeile, the CEO of the tech-career marketplace Dice, told BI that some of the biggest companies in the industry had determined that certain departments were no longer sufficiently profitable and that they needed to redirect resources to growth areas like artificial intelligence. "It is a shifting of bets," he said, adding that this routine trimming of jobs here and there is the new normal — for now. Unsurprisingly, even with growth in some areas, the drip-drip of reductions in the past couple of years appears to be making some tech workers nervous. In a June survey from Indeed that involved more than 1,100 US tech workers, 40% of respondents said they expected to be affected if their company conducted layoffs. Seven in 10 said they'd start looking to other employers if their company laid off workers. Linsey Fagan, a senior talent strategy advisor at Indeed, told BI that most of the recurring layoffs were in tech. That's likely because many companies in the industry grew quickly during the pandemic and are still adjusting. But those recurring cuts don't come without costs, Fagan said. "It's definitely not a sustainable strategy," she added. Fagan said employee sentiment starts to drop before a layoff as workers suspect cuts are coming. After the layoffs, workers' feelings about the company — and a CEO's acumen — take "a long-term dive," she said. "When you look at a business trying to come back from that — if they're continuously laying off, it simply can't happen," Fagan said. Even smaller-scale layoffs can make workers jittery, she said. Fagan added that the rise of technologies like generative AI and the threat of layoffs were pushing many in tech to build their skills. Tech workers looking for jobs on Indeed, she said, are now more likely to apply to staffing firms, which might offer temporary gigs, or to roles in areas like healthcare than to tech firms. Fagan said that while some tech workers are drawn to the flexibility that contingent or part-time roles can offer, tech has historically been the No. 1 industry tech workers want to work in. "They're just not feeling that stability right now," Fagan said. Some companies' penchant for regular nips and tucks could be a result of Wall Street's celebration of that type of trimming. At Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was "beautifully rewarded" by the market for making cuts, Zeile said, noting a rise in the company's stock price. Beyond what investors might cheer, the tech giants are getting older and no longer in growth mode, when their aim was often to snap up workers. Hence, many companies made cuts following the rush of hiring during the pandemic. Since then, some bosses have been looking to trim the size of their organization and otherwise make improvements. Zuckerberg famously declared that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency." He also said the directive would become a feature, not a bug. Zeile predicted that investors would eventually look to tech companies to do more than boost profits by trimming costs and would want to see a return to growth. He said hiring would pick up broadly as companies find they have many areas in need of workers. A company like Meta might be cutting in some areas, but it's growing elsewhere, Zeile said. "Meta is actually on a tear right now," he said. "They're just no longer hiring VR engineers. They are hiring AI engineers, so they've actually boosted their hiring." Fagan said a sign that the tech industry might be closer to stabilizing was that, after declining for several years, job postings in areas like software development had remained flat in recent months, though they're still 30% below 2020 levels. Of course, that means there are fewer opportunities for laid-off workers. Still, she said, it's an indication that companies are being careful not to hire too many people. "It's not like they're going out and massively hiring and then doing layoffs," Fagan said. Welfle, who was laid off from Microsoft, wrote on LinkedIn that he was looking for a content-design role — maybe with a smaller company. He also said some of his feelings were similar to those he experienced after his layoff in December. "I'm having a hard time disentangling my sense of value and self-worth from my identity as a corporate worker," he said. "But I'll definitely be reflecting on that, and finding gentler, more sustainable ways to exist in a capitalist society."

Title: Learning to love nuclear power

Time Published: 2024-10-18T09:42:39Z

Good morning. It’s been an encouraging week for fans of nuclear power. Amazon announced investments in three “innovative nuclear energy projects,” alongside Citadel’s Ken Griffin, that should deliver five gigawatts of zero-carbon energy over the next 15 years. Google announced a partnership with Kairos Power, which it described as “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors.” And that’s just this week. Microsoft last month announced a partnership with the energy firm Constellation to reopen a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island—yes, that Three Mile Island—to come online in 2028. Why the sudden nuclear renaissance? The energy needed to power data centers for AI is one reason. The need to reduce carbon emissions amid climate change is another. Public support for nuclear energy has been growing in recent years. While nuclear power is clean, nuclear fission, the process to produce it, uses radioactive materials that can cause deadly levels of radiation if released into the environment in an accident. I recently spoke with Patti Poppe, the CEO of California’s Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for the Leadership Next podcast that’s sponsored by Deloitte, which also supports this newsletter. Poppe has been focused on turning around the company’s operations, safety record, and culture, after PG&E’s culpability in the 2018 Camp wildfire put the utility into bankruptcy. Poppe believes the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is “an important part of the mix.” “The conversation has changed globally and here in the United States,” says Poppe. ‘I think the nation has realized that we can operate nuclear units safely, that, yes, it was scary in the seventies, but that is a long time ago. And we have realized that there are ways, just like with wildfire prevention, where we have a risk mitigation system in place at our nuclear power plant where we can fail safely.” What’s different is the emergence of small modular reactors or SMRs. Although versions have been around for years, the U.S. government and private corporations began making serious investments in developing them over the past decade. With their smaller and more flexible size, they can be quickly scaled up and adapted to a range of needs. But none are yet online in the U.S. and will need to clear regulatory approval. Bob Nardelli, the former Chrysler and Home Depot CEO, understands the landscape from his days at GE Power. Through his private-equity investment firm, X-LR8, Nardelli is now invested in BWX Technologies (BWXT), which makes a range of nuclear components and services. “I think it’s the solution for the future,” says Nardelli. “You don’t get line sag (sudden voltage drops), distribution loss, fires due to lightning hitting electrical lines and the life cycle is extradordinary.” More news below.

Title: Vice Bosses Talk Next Steps Following Bankruptcy And Tease New Production Finance Facility That Will Make It A “One-Stop Studio Shop”
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/10/vice-business-model-production-finance-facility-1236117304/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T18:27:52Z
Full Content:
By Diana Lodderhose International Features Editor EXCLUSIVE: This year has seen a swath of global production and distribution entities in film and television impacted by layoffs and cuts, and Vice Media Group has been no exception. Following the company’s much-publicized bankruptcy in 2022, when it was sold for $350 million to hedge fund and former investor Fortress, the group underwent a raft of layoffs and restructuring earlier this year, with its production business, Vice Studios Group, now being led by Jamie Hall in London and Danny Gabai in Los Angeles. But Hollywood loves a comeback, and Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon tells Deadline in a rare interview that Vice is back from the brink in a smaller capacity but with a clear vision and money to spend — the latter in the form of an imminent production finance facility, which it hopes to launch before the year end. Watch on Deadline “There’s no doubt that the business is far healthier than it was a year ago,” says Dixon. “One of the things I want to focus on is obviously culture and morale – it’s a tough industry to be in at the moment but we’re feeling positive because we have become a far more agile company.” The Vice chief says he expects the company to be in profit in Q1 2025. “We’re smaller, we take opportunities where we can now and, more importantly, we’re backed by our investors and our board in terms of looking for opportunities for growth and exciting projects.” Today, the company is operating at 30% of its size compared to the beginning of the year. Dixon says this leaner operation – and particularly its global production entity Vice Studios Group, which is behind projects such as Gangs of London, the Saoirse Ronan feature film Bad Apples, Netflix doc Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now and upcoming hybrid musical/doc Pavements – means it can better adapt to the changing market. Key to this, Dixon says, will be the introduction of a production finance facility, which it is currently at the “advanced stages” of securing. The London-based exec says he was recently in LA working on securing the production facility which will, he says, help propel the company’s strategy to move its studio business into a “more IP-based” content business and will enable it to be a “one-stop studio shop.” “We were forced to be a camera for hire for so long and that had more to do with our corporate resources than anything else,” says Dixon. “So, being able to break through what we went through in a much-publicized bankruptcy, we’re now focusing on the positives of being in the content business.” He continues: “We’re recognizing that we’ve always had that skillset, but we’ve just never had the financial capability to go out and be the super studio – which we have all the skills for, but we’ve never been able to put something up front on projects and get involved at earlier stages. That’s somewhat hindered us. It hasn’t hindered our creativity, but it’s hindered our output and our ability to improve margins and be a more successful financial business.” Vice Studios Group co-president Gabai notes that with streaming services and many premium cablers “moving away from a world where they do all-rights buyouts,” the introduction of a facility will better enable Vice to compete on a global scale for content via co-financing agreements or co-productions. “We do so much global production in the UK and other territories that, for us, it feels like there are more opportunities for windowing,” he says. “There’s an opportunity for a studio player out there who can really step into that role and fill the gap on productions that may be launching out of the UK, or other territories, and we can give them that extra piece of resource that they would need to go into production.” While Dixon couldn’t reveal any more details about numbers or timing on the finance facility, he did indicate that he was hopeful it will launch “before the end of the year.” “It’s something that is a priority for us and we hope to close it soon,” he says. “But it will allow us to have more possibilities as a company and allows us to be a little more opportunistic in our ideas, while also bringing more certainty around the projects we are doing.” Vice Media Group, which moved out of the online news game earlier this year, has trimmed down to focus on its Virtue ad agency and Vice TV, a joint venture with A&E, in addition to its studio business. Meanwhile, Vice Digital, a culture hub publishing content on and around Vice’s platforms, which Dixon notes was a “massive financial burden for us,” has since relaunched under a new joint venture with Nashville-based Savage Ventures. In the company’s tumultuous 18 months, one bright spot has been its global production business Vice Studios Group, which has a distribution catalogue of more than 1,000 hours and oversees five premium production entities: Pulse Films, UnTypical, Vice Studios LatAm, Vice Studios Canada and a news documentary unit. By the end of 2024, the group expects to have produced 21 projects including Pulse Films-produced Pavements, from director Alex Ross Perry, and Sky Original and Pulse Films series Atomic, starring Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif, the latter of which wrapped in Morocco last summer. The company is currently shooting the third season of British crime drama Gangs of London (seasons 1 & 2 launched on Netflix in September as part of a wide-ranging deal with AMC Networks) and also premiered Jason Pollard-directed doc Ol’Dirty Bastard: A Tale of Two Dirtys at the UK’s Doc’n Roll Film Festival. Vice Studios and Viral Nation recently announced the development of unscripted series Montana Boyz (working title), about TikTok cowboys Kaleb Winterbrun, Mark Estes and Kade Wilcox. “This will be the largest production year we’ve ever had, which is crazy when we are coming out of a bankruptcy,” says Gabai. “We’ve had this happen with all of the headwinds going on around us and a really tough marketplace, but now those headwinds are behind us.” Gabai notes that he and fellow Co-President Hall had previously restructured the studio business when Vice Studios and Pulse merged a few years prior to the bankruptcy. “I think, to some extent, the studio has been operating with the benefit of a very tightly knit group of people for a couple of years,” he says. The manifesto for the studios business is to focus on director-driven talent: “We tend to work with really great filmmakers and, oftentimes, if they’re not already huge household names when we start working with them, they tend to grow into big names off the back of doing projects with us.” This year, Vice reunited with its Fyre documentary director Chris Smith for Devo, a doc about the band of the same name which launched in Sundance earlier this year. It is also producing Hollywood Ending, from Tiger King director Rebecca Chaiklin, via its UnTypical strand, which follows the downfall of Zach Horwitz, the charismatic “midwestern, millennial Madoff” who ran a $690M Ponzi scheme under the noses of those closest to him. The latter was picked up by Amazon MGM. “I used to say in my agent days that talented people are always talented,” says Gabai. “Whether somebody’s having a hot moment or a cold moment or they’re making a million things at once, or they haven’t worked for a couple of years – if someone is really talented and attacks their projects in an interesting way, that’s somebody we want to bet on.” It was this vision that ultimately led Vice Studios to bringing aboard Listen Up Philip director Ross Perry to helm Pavements, a documentary/fiction hybrid about the venerable U.S. indie rock band Pavement fronted by Stephen Malkmus. Pavement is best known for songs such as “Cut Your Hair” and “Stereo,” which they released through Matador Records. The Pulse Films-produced project, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and is having its UK premiere at the London Film Festival today, intimately shows the band preparing for their sold-out 2022 reunion tour, while simultaneously taking the audience behind the scenes of the making of a musical, a museum and a spoof Hollywood biopic, featuring Jason Schwarzman as Matador Records founder Chris Lombardi and Joe Keery as Malkmus. Matador Records and Pavement were keen to do something “totally different” says Gabai, and he says that “this felt like a good opportunity to take the piss out of a standard music documentary.” “Alex was the top director on my list and Stephen seems like the character that Alex would have written about and created,” says Gabai. For Ross Perry, he was drawn to the “big, structural conceit of the film: “I just thought this movie should take place in a world where Pavement are as worthy of every form of tribute as say, the Rolling Stones, The Beatles or David Bowie because, for a few 100,000 people, that’s true,” he says. “In the spirit of the band, we wanted to put this whole endeavor in quotation marks, in the way they put the idea of being a successful band in quotations.” Pavements, says Gabai, is a prime example of the kinds of projects Vice Studios will aim to back going forward. “It’s always filmmaker first for us. Everything we do is driven by the filmmaker or the showrunner or the core creative on any project, what they want to do with the material on that project and what they want to say about this crazy world that we live in while doing it in a way that is fun and entertaining.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: From Tariffs to Taxes to Tyranny, Hollywood Braces for the Possibility of a Donald Trump Victory

Director Ali Abbasi basked in the applause, confident that the eight-minute standing ovation “The Apprentice” was enjoying in Cannes last May meant that his six-year gamble to bring the film to the screen was about to pay off. The movie, a look at Donald Trump’s early years as a real estate developer and his friendship with Roy Cohn, was scouting for distribution. Armed with this kind of reception, Abbasi believed he would soon have Netflix, or one of the prominent indie studios, knocking on his door. But though “The Apprentice” drew interest from the usual suspects, there were no offers — not even a lowball one. The film, which depicts Trump getting liposuction, abusing amphetamines, running his casino into the ground and raping his first wife, Ivana, was simply too hot to handle. With Trump locked in a tight race for the White House, major studios, indie labels and streamers, or at least their corporate parents, couldn’t risk alienating the once and possibly future king.

So he can come after you with all these regulations and taxes.” he adds, “But it still upsets me.” Popular on Variety Abbasi’s experience says a lot about the anxiety gripping the entertainment world as it watches a tumultuous, enormously consequential election unfold. From corporate suites to studio lots, Hollywood is bracing for a possible Trump return, one that could bring chaos and deepen political divisions in a polarized country. “There’s a lot of nervousness,” says Schuyler M. Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker, who practices entertainment, corporate and tax law. “They don’t know exactly what he would do if he got back in power.” The actors, writers and directors who make most of what Hollywood exports are overwhelmingly supportive of Kamala Harris and view Trump as an existential threat to their freedoms. They speak at rallies for the Democratic nominee, host fundraisers and make personal contributions. And they’re terrified about what Trump would mean for everything from abortion access to environmental protections — to say nothing of the frontal assault on the rule of law he seems hell-bent on waging. “Everything’s at stake,” says Sarah Paulson, the Emmy- and Tony-winning actress and a Harris supporter. “Democracy is on the ballot.” But the people who sign Paulson and other artists’ checks have complicated loyalties — they seem more worried about making money than maintaining democratic norms. For them, a second Trump term would mean lower taxes and less antitrust enforcement, a key attraction for a debt-ridden industry looking to consolidate. They are banking on Trump behaving like a generic Republican by embracing a pro-business agenda. But Trump has been less interested in ideology and more attracted to a politics of personal grievance, one that rewards sycophants and punishes critics. Trump’s erratic behavior in his first term made it difficult for companies to figure out how to navigate his administration without offending him. Despite that challenge, his policies were often good for corporate bottom lines. In 2017, Trump signed a massive tax cut, lowering corporate rates from 35% to 21%. The bill included benefits that were especially helpful to Hollywood, including a lowered rate on overseas income and the ability to immediately write off the full cost of film and TV productions. Disney and Comcast each saved more than $6 billion in the following four years, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. If elected to a second term, Trump has vowed to cut the corporate rate even further — to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. Harris, in contrast, wants to hike the rate to 28% and increase the tax on overseas income. Regardless of who wins, the Motion Picture Association, which represents seven Hollywood studios, is already seeking to influence the next tax law. In a Sept. 25 letter, the lobbying group urged Congress to preserve the benefits of the Trump tax cut, arguing that it “led to a profound increase in film and television production and ownership in the U.S.” On the other hand, Trump has targeted companies that own news operations, sometimes in performative ways, but sometimes with genuine consequences. In the last month, he has threatened to pull the broadcast licenses of CBS and Disney’s ABC over their coverage, and he is currently suing ABC. He has threatened to investigate Comcast for “treason” over NBC’s coverage of the Russia scandal. And in 2017, his Justice Department sued to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, which some saw as retaliation against CNN for its coverage of his campaign and presidency. Looking ahead, Trump has pledged to use his office to prosecute opponents. Since many media conglomerates operate news divisions and produce late-night shows that investigate, criticize or lampoon Trump, that could make them a legal and political target for a president obsessed with personal retribution. “I could see him asking Republicans to pass a law saying anything anti-government is treasonous,” says Moore. “And I could also see him trying to upend current defamation law, so it becomes much easier to go after people. That could have a chilling effect on free speech.” Moore faults companies for being too enamored of the tax cuts that Trump is proposing and insufficiently fearful of his authoritarian impulses. “He’s not kidding around,” he says. “I’m not sure how great it would be for them to live in a country without a functional democracy.” Those darker predictions may not come to pass, but whoever wins the Oval Office will have to deal with a media industry that’s desperate to keep merging. And since the next president’s administration will be tasked with enforcing antitrust law, that will give either Trump or Harris enormous power over Hollywood’s future. The Biden administration has antagonized Wall Street by appointing enforcers — Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, anti-trust division chief at the Justice Department — who have targeted corporate power, especially in tech. Critics argue that has had a chilling effect. “They created an environment that made dealmaking more difficult,” says Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. “They’ve scared away deals.” It’s not obvious which administration would be better for companies. Kovacic assumes that Trump would back off on the Biden approach, though he adds, “if you’re a company he hates, he’s not beyond revenge.” Harris, meanwhile, sued several companies on antitrust grounds when she was California attorney general. But she was reluctant to take big swings at the tech industry, according to a memoir by Kathleen Foote, the longtime chief of the AG’s antitrust section. Kovacic says Harris might go a little easier than Biden, but in a subtle way, so as not to rile her left flank. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently urged the Justice Department to scrutinize Venu, the new sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, saying it would raise subscription prices across the industry. If Harris is elected, Sanders and Warren are likely to keep up the pressure on her administration on that and similar issues. Warner Bros. Discovery is struggling under a massive debt load, and another merger may be its only means of survival. At the Allen & Co. conference in July, CEO David Zaslav didn’t endorse a candidate, but said he hoped the next administration will see the benefits of consolidation. “We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,” he said. The Hollywood unions have supported the Biden approach, arguing that media consolidation suppresses wages and results in layoffs. “The Biden administration has been the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” says Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 65,000 Hollywood workers and has endorsed Harris. “It was an easy call for us,” Loeb says. Entertainment companies also face the risk of an all-out trade war. Hollywood is an export business, but many studios belong to companies such as Sony and Apple that also import electronics and other goods to the U.S. Trump has promised a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods coming from China. That would unleash “chaos” in a global marketplace, says Ed Brzytwa, the VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. “All the agreements, rules and norms will start to unravel,” he says. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, most of which Biden retained. They amounted to a $32 billion levy on electronic goods through 2021, according to Brzytwa’s group. The Consumer Technology Association — whose members include Sony, Disney, Amazon and Comcast — argues that the tariffs failed to revive U.S. manufacturing, but did push production to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and Taiwan. In 2022, Sony Electronics moved much of its camera production to Thailand. Harris would likely maintain the Biden approach, using targeted tariffs more aggressively than under previous Democratic administrations. Trump’s overall tariff rates would be seven times higher than the current level, according to the Tax Foundation. If he follows through, prices would rise, and the resulting drop in demand, for many companies, would outweigh any gains from lower tax rates, Brzytwa says. “I think there is a lot of interest in the corporate world in preserving what was accomplished in the [Trump tax bill],” he says. “But they don’t want a situation where the U.S. is a fortress and is closed off from the world.” Brzytwa warns that other countries would likely retaliate, making life more difficult for exporters — even entertainment producers. Media giants shoot all over the world, taking advantage of foreign subsidies. They employ creative talent overseas, and release movies and television shows to vast international regions, where they hope to drive future growth. Trump’s protectionist policies could disrupt that. They would threaten to reframe America’s role in the global economy, straining alliances and fracturing trade partnerships. The consequences of those actions would be felt in almost every sector of the economy. “You have someone in Trump with the potential to blow it all up,” says Tina Fordham, the founder of Fordham Global Foresight and an expert on geopolitical risk. “If the rules of the game and international norms aren’t respected, then the U.S. will no longer be treated as a reliable global trading partner. That means all the advantages that America has enjoyed in the post-World War II era could erode. I’m not sure people appreciate how destabilizing this could be.” Some of that impact is already being felt. A decade ago, Hollywood was still focused on opening the Chinese market to American films. But that initiative faded away as the relationship soured. “That ship has sailed,” says Greg Frazier, who worked on the issue while at the MPA. “Whether it’s Harris or Trump, I don’t see any great opening in China, on either side.” As for “The Apprentice,” after months in limbo, the producers finally signed a deal with Briarcliff Entertainment, a tiny distribution company that has handled politically charged fare such as “The Dissident,” a 2020 documentary about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that also scared off major media outlets. “It was such a relief to get into theaters,” Abbasi says. “I spent the summer clinically depressed and thinking, ‘We did all this work, and nobody is ever going to see our film.’” Instead, “The Apprentice” opened in theaters on Oct. 11, a month before a presidential election that could return Trump to the pinnacle of power. Abbasi is glad that someone had the courage to release his movie, but he won’t forget the fear he encountered while trying to get “The Apprentice” in front of audiences. “The big story for me is how one human being is intimidating the 300 million or so people who live in America,” Abbasi says. “How can an entire country let that happen?” Jack Dunn contributed to this report.
