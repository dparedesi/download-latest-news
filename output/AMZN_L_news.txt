The American information space is not merely changing; it is undergoing a hostile takeover. It is a deliberate, coordinated campaign by a new class of oligarchs out of Silicon Valley that includes Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg acting in concert with a Trump-led authoritarian political project. Their goal is singular: to systematically dismantle the free press and rebuild it as a network of propaganda organs designed to protect and uphold the regime and the oligarchs. The gutting of The Washington Post is not a separate event from the algorithmic manipulation of X. The defunding of PBS is not disconnected from the weaponization of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These are interconnected fronts in a single, undeclared war on the very concept of an informed public. To understand the nature of this war you must turn to Hannah Arendt and her concept of “a fool’s freedom.”[1] The modern deprivation of rights comes not from the overt censorship of opinion, but from the construction of an ecosystem where that opinion is rendered impotent. It is the freedom to speak into the abyss. What good is the right to an opinion if that opinion can never gain traction, never reach a critical mass, and therefore never matter? The oligarchs’ total control over the means of distribution (the algorithms of Google, Tiktok, Meta, and X) is the silent, brutally effective mechanism for enforcing this new, more insidious form of authoritarianism. The first front in this war is the capture and neutering of the legacy press from within. The billionaire owners of media, acting more as a political ideologue than a business custodian, have seized direct control of the nation’s most storied newsrooms. The narrative of financial necessity has become the perfect camouflage for an ideological purge. The language of “reinvention” and “transformation” is a smokescreen, obscuring a systematic effort to install loyalists, enforce regime-friendly editorial lines, and drive out any journalist who dares to uphold the quaint notion of holding power to account. This is a coordinated purge executed by a new class of authoritarian oligarchs who see a free press not as a pillar of democracy, but as an obstacle to their regime. The Press Has Been Systematically Dismantled by the Highest Bidder The Washington Post’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” now reads like a grim epitaph carved on its own tombstone. Democracy died and Jeff Bezos helped take it out back to shoot it and bury it for good measure. When Jeff Bezos bought the paper, many in the media hoped for a savior. Instead, it got an executioner and undertaker. The veneer of benevolent, hands-off ownership fell away as the prospect of a second Trump administration loomed, and the Amazon kingpin began his work: systematically gutting the institution and bending it to his will. The purge that followed was brutal. Under the watch of CEO Will Lewis, a political hatchet man brought over from the Murdoch empire, a wave of talent was driven out. Veterans with decades of experience were shown the door. A Pulitzer-winning cartoonist was silenced for satirizing the new power structure. Those who weren't fired were encouraged to take buyouts, fleeing a newsroom consumed by a crisis of purpose. What remains is a hollowed-out shell, a once-great institution forced into dutiful submission. On the West Coast, the same playbook is running its course at the Los Angeles Times. Billionaire owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has presided over a slow-motion demolition, using the cudgel of financial crisis to carry out a political hit. Under the cover of staggering financial losses that have only mounted under his ownership, Soon-Shiong has unleashed a relentless series of layoffs, gutting over 20% of the newsroom and leaving it, in the words of its own union, “a shadow of its former self.”[2] But the carnage isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about silencing a powerful, critical voice. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong personally intervened to kill a presidential endorsement that would have angered Trump. He has since been explicit about his goal of imposing a “more balanced ideological approach,” and to do so, he has brought in Republican operatives, including the former head of a pro-Trump PAC, to help reshape the paper’s editorial board. The strategy is clear: starve the newsroom, then restaff it with loyalists. The capture of individual newspapers is only phase one. The next is to weaken any remaining progressive outposts, leaving them vulnerable. MSNBC, long a bastion of liberal politics under its headline star, Rachel Maddow, is being led to the slaughter. Parent company Comcast is spinning the network off, severing it from the newsroom of NBC News and the broader protection of NBCUniversal. This isn't a business decision; it’s an abandonment. MSNBC is being left on the side of the road, an isolated and weakened target ripe for a takeover. The "jokes" by Elon Musk about buying the network and firing its stars are not jokes at all. They are the vultures circling, a public declaration of intent from the oligarch class. And their ambition doesn’t stop at the news. It extends to the very fabric of culture. The persistent rumors that Jeff Bezos plans to acquire Condé Nast (Vogue, Wired, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair) as a wedding gift for his wife, Lauren Sanchez, reveals the endgame.[3] This is the terminal stage of oligarchic conquest where the power to shape global culture is reduced to a personal trinket. It is the ultimate expression of contempt for the public sphere, a world where the means of mass communication become just another luxury good, molded to the whims of our new feudal lords. The Algorithmic Coup: Seizing the Means of Reality Production While the oligarchs have been conducting a hostile takeover of legacy media, they have also been slowly amping up their control of the algorithms that curate reality itself to the vast majority of the population. It’s a hostile takeover of the digital public square by a handful of oligarchs acting in service to an authoritarian regime. The "For You" page and the News Feed have been weaponized, turned from sorting tools into active instruments of political power, used to manufacture consent and crush dissent on a scale that makes old-world propaganda look primitive. Elon Musk’s seizure of Twitter and its rebranding as X is the playbook’s most brazen chapter. Under the fraudulent banner of “free speech absolutism,” he gutted the platform and began the real work: transforming a global communication tool into his personal propaganda megaphone. His philosophy of “Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom of Reach” was a lie from the start, a pretext for a system where his allies are amplified and his critics are shadow banned into oblivion. After his endorsement of Donald Trump, the political agenda became undeniable. Researchers identified a "structural break" in the algorithm, a point where the code was rewritten to systematically favor Republican accounts.[4] The system is now so blatantly biased that it has triggered investigations by the European Commission. The final piece of this ideological propaganda project is Grok, his AI chatbot that called itself “MechaHitler” just last week is being aligned to avoid being "woke," creating a model that reflects his own paranoid worldview back at him.[5] While Musk’s takeover was a frontal assault, Mark Zuckerberg’s at Meta is a strategic surrender. Facing the threat of a vengeful Trump administration, Zuckerberg has preemptively neutered his platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to appease the ascendant right. This is not principle; it is appeasement from a man who was seemingly birthed without a spine or personality of his own. In a sweeping act of capitulation dressed in gaudy chains and baggy t-shirts, Zuckerberg dismantled Meta's third-party fact-checking program, a system long despised by conservatives, and replacing it with a manipulated "Community Notes" model imported from Musk's X. He has opened the floodgates for inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and gender, especially transgender people, ensuring the regime's talking points will flow freely. Zuckerberg has seen which way the wind is blowing and is ensuring his platforms will serve as a hospitable environment for the new power. The final and biggest prize in this digital war is TikTok, the dominant cultural artery for an entire generation. The forced sale of the platform from its Chinese parent company, justified under the pretext of "national security," is a blatant lie. The true objective is not to protect American data, which could be done by passing meaningful data protections, but rather, to seize control of the world's most powerful algorithm for influencing youth culture.[6] The leading proposed buyer is a consortium led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of Donald Trump's most powerful and loyal allies in Silicon Valley and whose son, David Ellison, is currently finalizing his own takeover of Paramount and plans on repurposing CBS News into a propaganda organ by placing Bari Weiss in charge.[7] Placing TikTok in the hands of a regime loyalist is the strategic masterstroke. It would give them direct control over the primary information channel for a generation that has been historically resistant to their message. It is the power to decide what trends, what is cool, and what is thinkable. The forced sale of TikTok is nothing less than a state-orchestrated hostile takeover of the youth's collective consciousness. The State’s Assault on Truth The oligarchs' private capture of the media is but one arm of a pincer movement. The other is a direct, state led assault by the Trump administration and its allies on any remaining sources of independent information. This demonstrates a core tenet of modern authoritarianism: there is no distinction between the state and the party. All levers of government, from regulatory agencies to the justice system and the federal budget are seen not as instruments of public service, but rather as legitimate weapons to be used to reward allies and punish enemies. From this perspective, these actions are not an abuse of the system; they are the system's intended purpose. The campaign to destroy public broadcasting in America is a long-term, strategic priority for the Trump movement, laid bare in the pages of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's comprehensive playbook for a second Trump term. The plan is not merely to reform public media but to annihilate it. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the complete defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides essential funding for NPR and PBS stations across the country. The blueprint goes further, advocating for stripping these outlets of their non-commercial educational status and even moving them off their desirable FM radio frequencies to make way for religious and Christian nationalist broadcasting. The justification is that public media is a "liberal disinformation machine" that must be dismantled.[8] The rescission package expected to pass Congress this week will zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and claw back $1.1 billion in funding already allocated to the CPB.[9] This effort to starve public media would be devastating, particularly for rural and underserved communities that rely on these stations as their primary source of local news and emergency information, effectively creating vast "news deserts" across the country. That’s entirely the point. They need to ensure that those living in rural areas become hopelessly dependent on propaganda in order to access even basic information about the world around them. The final weapon in the state's arsenal is the legal and regulatory system itself, which is being wielded to intimidate, extort, and co-opt media organizations into submission. The Trump administration is increasingly using every aspect of government to intimidate and coerce media organizations into yielding to its narrative. The most chilling precedent is the $16 million settlement paid by Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, to end a frivolous lawsuit brought by Donald Trump.[10] Paramount has an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media pending before the Trump-controlled FCC. The FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, had already reopened a dubious "news distortion" investigation into the very same interview, placing the merger in jeopardy. Facing this immense pressure, Paramount capitulated. This case is part of a broader pattern of using various federal agencies as a sword of Damocles. Trump and his appointees have repeatedly threatened to use the power of the FCC and FTC to punish their perceived enemies. This includes threats to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like NBC and ABC for "Country Threatening Treason," launching politically motivated investigations into news outlets, and promising to bring these supposedly independent agencies under direct presidential authority. This strategy of direct state coercion creates a pervasive climate of fear, encouraging self-censorship and ensuring that media owners think twice before publishing anything that might anger the regime. The Fool's Freedom The sum total of these actions by the oligarchs to capture legacy media, manipulate the algorithmic control of digital platforms, and use the state to assault any remaining independent voices has created a terrifyingly effective new model of information control. It is a system that maintains the outward appearance of a free and diverse media landscape. We still have websites to browse, podcasts to download, and newsletters to subscribe to. Many will even be harshly critical of the oligarchs and the Trump administration. We still possess, in the narrowest legal sense, the right to an opinion. But this is a fool’s freedom. As Hannah Arendt noted, the most profound deprivation of rights occurs not when you are forbidden to have an opinion, but when your opinion is rendered meaningless. The oligarchs’ control over the critical infrastructure of information distribution is the ultimate choke point. They are the gatekeepers of relevance, the silent arbiters of what is seen and what is buried, what is amplified and what is ignored. This new reality destroys the very possibility of public accountability. An independent journalist can break a world-changing story, a citizen can voice powerful dissent, but if these are algorithmically suppressed, they cannot reach a critical mass. They cannot generate public outrage. They cannot hold power to account. This is speech without consequence, opinion without impact. Arendt’s concept of “action,” meaning the speech and deeds through which we appear to one another and create a shared public world, is rendered impossible. We are witnessing the construction of a sophisticated, 21st-century propaganda state. It is a state that doesn’t need to burn books when it can simply change the algorithm. It maintains the illusion of choice while ensuring, through a seamless integration of private ownership, state intimidation, and algorithmic control, that only one narrative prevails. The choice we are left with is not between different news sources, but between different flavors of state and oligarch approved information. This is the grim reality of the fool’s freedom in which we now live. Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (Expanded edition. ed. 2025) at p. 315. (“The same is true even to an ironical extent with regard to the right of freedom which is sometimes considered to be the very essence of human rights. There is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have more freedom of movement than a lawfully imprisoned criminal or that they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a totalitarian country. But neither physical safety—being fed by some state or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool’s freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow. These last points are crucial. The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of choice, or when one is placed in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion.”) ↩︎ Farley Elliott, ‘Devastated’: New Layoffs Hit California’s Biggest Newspaper, SFGATE (May 2, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/la-times-layoffs-latest-20307200.php. ↩︎ Jeff Bezos Rumored To Buy Vogue as Wedding Gift to Lauren Sanchez, ‘Source’ Claims, Yahoo Entertainment (Jul. 7, 2025), https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/jeff-bezos-rumored-buy-vogue-120000915.html. ↩︎ Wes Davis, A Study Found That X’s Algorithm Now Loves Two Things: Republicans and Elon Musk, The Verge (Nov. 17, 2024), https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change. ↩︎ Alejandra Caraballo, The Algorithmic Unmasking: How Grok’s “MechaHitler” Turn Revealed the Inevitable Collapse of “Anti-Woke” AI, The Dissident (Jul. 9, 2025), https://www.thedissident.news/the-algorithmic-unmasking-how-groks-mechahitler-turn-revealed-the-inevitable-collapse-of-anti-woke-ai/. ↩︎ Mike Masnick, Once More With Feeling: Banning TikTok Is Unconstitutional & Won’t Do Shit To Deal With Any Actual Threats, Techdirt (Mar. 14, 2024), https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/14/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-is-unconstitutional-wont-do-shit-to-deal-with-any-actual-threats/. ↩︎ Brian Stelter, CBS’ Likely New Owner Is in Talks with Bari Weiss to Buy The Free Press | CNN Business, CNN (Jul. 11, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/media/free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-paramount. ↩︎ Project 2025: What a Second Trump Term Could Mean for Media and Technology Policies, Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/ (last visited Jul. 17, 2025). ↩︎ Scott Neuman, Senate Approves Cuts to NPR, PBS and Foreign Aid Programs, NPR, Jul. 17, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote. ↩︎ Benjamin Mullin Michael M.

Title: Trump considers changes to H-1B visa program

By WND Staff July 19, 2025 The often-controversial H-1B visa foreign-worker program may be getting updated under President Trump’s Homeland Security Department. The program was meant to provide American firms more options to hire qualified workers, including those from foreign countries. However, as WND has covered extensively, the H-1B system has been used countless times to replace Americans with less expensive immigrants. For example, while U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a recent round targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut more than 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs.

As reported at the National Pulse, Thursday DHS filed a notice of a possible change in H-1B requirements with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to the report, the proposal includes a “weighted selection process” for applicants under the capped portion of the program. The filing, however, provides no further details as to how the new system would function. The statutory cap for H-1B visas is set at 85,000 per year. During the 2024 presidential campaign, prominent supporters of Donald Trump publicly disagreed about the value of the H-1B program, with both Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy expressing support. Opinion polls on the program, however, have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the visa program. Trump had previously argued that H-1B visas are “unfair” to American workers, saying in 2016, “I know the H-1B very well. And it’s something that I frankly use, and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it.” As the National Pulse points out, critics of the program argue that the current lottery system disproportionately benefits larger companies such as Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and leaves American workers at a disadvantage, having to compete with cheap foreign labor. A weighted system could potentially replace the random lottery system as a means to prioritize better qualified visa applicants.

Title: ₹1 crore savings and life is set? It is high time to relook at your age old middle class dream
URL: https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/1-crore-savings-and-life-is-set-it-is-high-time-to-relook-at-your-age-old-middle-class-dream-inflation-savings-11752901876041.html

“Ek crore ho gaya toh life set hai” -- This sentence has echoed across drawing rooms, chai stalls, the LIC agent brochures for decades and not to mention Amitabh Bachchan’s deep voice emphasising the importance of “ek crore” in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in early 2000s. It was the ultimate middle-class milestone — the surefire way of making it big in life. But in 2025, that one-crore dream does not hold much water? It’s more of a mirage than a milestone. Because by the time you say “I’ve made it”, inflation, EMIs, and real-life curveballs have already gatecrashed the party. Let’s unmask the myth that ₹1 crore is enough and see why financial “settling down” has become a moving goalpost. 1. Inflation is eating your money faster than you think: In the early 2000s, ₹1 crore could buy you a house, a car, and still leave enough for FD interest to run your household. But not today. In a city like Bangalore or Mumbai, this won’t even get you a decent 2BHK house. Add to that 4-6% inflation, and your one crore will feel like ₹30–40 lakh in no time. Reality: The same ₹30 dosa is now ₹120, and that’s just breakfast. 2. One medical emergency can wipe out your savings: Middle-class families are just one health scare away from financial turmoil. A decent cancer treatment, bypass surgery, or organ transplant costs ₹15–30 lakh. If your health cover is the standard ₹5 lakh from years ago, your savings become collateral damage. One ICU bill = Goodbye one crore. 3. Lifestyle inflation is real: Your lifestyle has levelled up, but have your savings kept pace? From iPhones to impulse Zomato orders, your crore can vanish without warning. 4. Job security is an illusion: And sadly, no private sector job is permanent anymore, not even in MNCs, IT, or startups. One recession, one restructuring, or one AI tool and boom – layoffs, pay cuts, or upskilling pressure. Ask any techie in their 40s — they’ve seen the axe fall. So if your plan was: “Retire early, start a homestay in Goa” with that crore, it is better to rework the spreadsheet. 5. Children’s education costs a fortune: Think ₹1 crore will help you chill post-retirement? Think again. A decent Indian private university will cost you ₹30–40 lakh. Foreign education? ₹1–1.5 crore easily. And this doesn’t even include coaching fees, laptops, or hostel charges. So basically: one child = one crore. Why do we still worship this ₹1 crore figure? Because it feels big. It’s a round, shiny number. But feelings don’t beat facts. And in today’s India, facts are brutal. Financial stability is no longer a destination. It’s a continuous journey and ₹1 crore is just the petrol pump, not the finish line. Multiple income sources: Don’t just rely on one job. Freelance, invest, rent out property — hustle smart, not just hard. Large emergency reserve: It is recommended to keep 6 to 12 months of expenses ready. One job loss shouldn’t lead to moving into your parents’ house. Health and life insurance: Get real coverage ₹25–50 lakh minimum for health. And no, your office insurance doesn’t count when you’re between the jobs. Smart investing: FDs won’t save you. SIPs in mutual funds, index funds, NPS — that’s where your money should be working overtime. Financial literacy: You don’t need a full-fledged chartered accountancy qualification but you definitely must understand inflation, taxation, and compounding. Your financial future relies on it. Most middle-class Indians aren’t financially stable, they’re just financially suspended. One layoff, one surgery, one market crash and the whole “life set hai" illusion collapses like a pack of cards. Ask yourself:If your income had stopped today, for how long would you live your current lifestyle?If your answer is less than 10–12 years — you’re not “settled.” You’re playing financial Jenga, hoping the next brick doesn’t topple everything. “Life is stable only when money works for you in your sleep and your survival doesn’t depend on active income.” So, the ₹one crore dream isn’t dead, it just needs an upgrade – perhaps to a bigger number. Add hustle, protection, awareness, and growth to it and then you’re getting close to “settled.” Catch all the Instant Personal Loan, Business Loan, Business News, Money news, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. economy has been surprisingly resilient while the tariff wars rage even though prices may go up as inventories dwindle, consumers are becoming more value conscious, and investors are by turns sanguine and skittish. (Witness their reaction to the specter of President Trump potentially firing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as my colleague Jim Edwards noted in this piece.) I had a chance to speak with several business leaders at a roundtable convened by Edward Jones Managing Partner Penny Pennington recently at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Her concern was, “how do we help future generations build wealth in this uncertain economy?” With challenges like high home prices and an uncertain job market, she takes a holistic view of the customer. “We’re a wealth and wellbeing company.” The theme of investing took many forms. Bev Anderson, CEO of BECU credit union, focused on creating financial opportunities, while Gallup CEO Jon Clifton talked about the need for better global indicators of how we feel amid a rise in negative emotions. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack is expanding his energy infrastructure amid surging demand at the country’s second-largest utility. Optimism about the power of technology and innovation was mixed with worries about geopolitics and the state of civil society. In an era of growing complexity and rapid change, face-to-face conversations have become even more important for sharing ideas and building trusted relationships. That’s why the dinners hosted by CEO Initiative members around the country have been so valuable. It’s why I’m excited by our upcoming Fortune Global Forum on October 26 and 27 in Riyadh.

This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. On social media, he added, “I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.” He also asked the attorney general to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” on Epstein. Here is a timeline of the relationship between Trump and Epstein. How Sam Altman became Trump’s best AI buddy Initially cut out of the president’s circle by Elon Musk, Altman has been quietly cultivating his relationship with the president, the WSJ reports. With Musk out of the way, Altman is now more influential in the White House. The maneuvering required Altman to renounce his former public dislike of Trump. Trump vs. corn syrup President Trump’s announcement Wednesday claiming that Coca-Cola would substitute corn syrup for raw sugar in their products “cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs … all with no nutritional benefit,” the CEO of the Corn Refiners Association said on Wednesday. The announcement also caused significant dips in the stock prices of some corn syrup manufacturers between Wednesday and Thursday. Morgan Stanley on tariffs Morgan Stanley’s head of US policy, Monica Guerra, describes President Trump’s tariffs as a “mosaic” and “idiosyncratic.” Here’s how much she thinks they’ll bring to the U.S. Treasury—and how they could fuel higher inflation. Europe tightens sanctions on Russia The EU will impose a new set of sanctions on Russia targeting its oil, gas and banking sectors. Twenty more banks will be cut from the SWIFT payments system and there will be new restrictions on Russian oil refined outside of Russia. Meta poaches more AI talent from Apple Former Apple employees Mark Lee and Tom Gunter will join Meta’s Superintelligence Labs, according to Bloomberg. They will join Ruoming Pang, the former head of Apple’s large language model unit, who joined Meta a few weeks ago. Pang was reportedly offered $200 million in compensation to make the move. Deep dive on the growth of private credit JPMorgan recently dedicated $50 billion to debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals. Apollo, Ares, and KKR are extending credit that they originate independently to lock in borrowers for years. In exchange for tying up that long-term money, borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates than they would get from banks.

Time Published: 2025-07-17T22:56:17Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon Web Services joined the agentic AI frenzy in a big way this week, revealing at a New York City event Wednesday a host of services and tools dubbed Agentcore that let technologists build and deploy so-called AI agents capable of automating internal tasks while potentially overhauling the way consumers interact with online businesses too. These agents, to many in the tech industry, are the next evolution in our new AI-powered future, where artificial intelligence not only acts as an assistant, but can autonomously complete complex multi-step actions with just some human intervention in sensitive sectors like healthcare, and no human intervention in lower-risk areas. But at least in the short term, the real battle between AWS and agentic AI competitors may depend less on technology differentiation, and more on who employs the most quality talent to help guide large corporations on where to even begin with AI agents. Businesses “are frustrated because they want someone to tell them what to do and how to do it,” Dave Nicholson, chief technology advisor at The Futurum Group, told Fortune. “There isn’t enough [talent] to go around. Humans are the bottleneck.” Nicholson added that AWS and other cloud and large tech companies will need to heavily lean on partner companies to assist with customer education and implementation too. The business case for agents was pushed into the forefront last year by Salesforce, with the announcement of a new division it calls Agentforce. Google, OpenAI and other cloud and technology players have since rushed to announce AI agent tools and services geared toward corporations. On Thursday, a day after AWS’s showed off its agent tools, OpenAI announced a new, general purpose agent for users of its ChatGPT product. With just about every CEO these days under pressure to craft an AI strategy, the incoming AI agents may be poised to capitalize on the situation. “This is the highest level of ‘fear of missing out’ ever among behemoths in the IT industry right now,” Nicholson said. “These are existential decisions being made at Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.” In an interview with Fortune after his keynote presentation announcing a new in-house collection of agent-building services dubbed AgentCore as well as a marketplace for agents, AWS VP of agentic AI, Swami Sivasubramanian said that Fortune 500 execs whose companies don’t start experimenting with the technology risk missing out on a transformational moment as pivotal as the creation of the internet. “Agents are fundamentally going to change how we work and how we live,” Sivasubramanian said when asked how execs at Fortune 500 companies can be sure that their investments in building or deploying AI agents isn’t supplanted by a new shiny technology of the moment next year. The executive provided an example of how AI technologies will make it feasible for an agent to, for example, not only plan an itinerary for a trip, but do all of the bookings too. “You can give it a high level objective, like, ‘Hey, create me a 10 day itinerary in December to visit Australia,'” he said. “It actually understands the objective. Breaks it down into…I need a flight, I need activities to go see in these cities, and then, based on my preferences, it creates a customized itinerary, and actually also secures reservations by calling APIs.” That’s the type of personal, tangible, example that gives this AWS executive and other proponents of AI agents, the belief that many customer experiences can be overhauled, or created from scratch, with this technology — in ways that might even be hard to envision now. Slick as some of these scenarios may sound however, the reality is that there are currently few examples of corporations using agents at massive scale. The green field of opportunity is sure to be attractive for some, but it’s also a big challenge for the companies selling agentic products and tools since there are not many real-world examples to guide or inspire. Amazon Web Services’ market leadership in cloud computing should serve as some advantage, providing a large existing customer base to sell to. And because those companies’ operations are already dependent on AWS, they have more patience for any bumps Amazon experiences as it refines its AI agent business. “They’re more likely to get two or three strikes,” Nicholson said of AWS and its AI agent rollout. But it’s an open question whether AWS’ initial focus on heavily marketing its new agentic tools to software developers versus the executives with the purse strings will prove problematic. “They have disjointed messaging,” Mark Beccue, an analyst at the research firm Omdia, told TechTarget. “When talking about agents, you must have the complete story.” AWS’ Sivasubramanian said that most C-suite customers that he meets with naturally look inward to how their own organization runs when considering where and how to deploy AI agents first to help automate, or reduce the time to complete, boring, repetitive tasks. This, of course, raises the question of when and how AI agents will disrupt or displace jobs and in which areas. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently weighed in on the overall AI boom in an employee memo, saying that while these technologies will both eliminate current roles while creating new ones, “we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce [over the next few years] as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” On Thursday, a day after AWS’ agent-focused summit, the company carried out layoffs of at least hundreds of employees. A day earlier, Sivasubramanian, perhaps not surprisingly, struck an optimistic tone when discussing a new world full of AI agents that now Amazon — and many rivals — are rushing to bring to fruition. “Yes, in the short term, if you look at [past] transformations, there were actually changes on the specific job categories [in which people worked], “but then we as humans have really adapted to these changes and then started working on different things. You don’t find people who are doing Y2K engineering anymore.” Are you a current or former AWS employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Title: Is AI Coming For Your Team Next? How AI Hype Is Becoming The Hot Layoff Excuse
URL: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/is-ai-coming-for-your-team-next-how-ai-hype-is-becoming-the-hot-layoff-excuse/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T22:27:56Z

Rani Salehi, Principal Analyst If headlines are any indication, AI-driven downsizing is accelerating across B2B organizations. It seems that many senior executives have found “the perfect justification” for the workforce optimization they’ve been contemplating. The AI revolution isn’t only changing how work gets done — it’s providing cover for workforce reductions that may have little to do with actual capabilities. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO, indicated that “[with AI, we] will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in a note to employees. Meanwhile, AI is enabling Hewlett Packard Enterprise to reduce staff that it once needed. For example, the company has deployed AI agents in finance that are already displacing workers. Marie Myers, the company’s finance chief, recently spoke to investors as she justified eliminating 2,500 jobs (or 5% of HPE’s workforce): “Our ambition is clear: a leaner, faster, and more competitive organization. Nothing is off limits.” IBM’s CEO has also gone on record, stating that the company has laid off 8,000 workers already, mostly in HR, in favor of using AI agents. These and other job reduction numbers expose the growing scope of the AI-justified downsizing wave. US public companies have slashed professional staff by 3.5% over the past three years, and the recent AI-justified reductions are poised to balloon this figure further, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis of Live Data Technologies’ tracking across the labor market. Yes, we’ve also been operating in a volatile economic market, but here’s what makes this different from typical recession-driven layoffs: This isn’t about cuts for economic survival — it’s about workforce optimization disguised as technological inevitability. The high-profile examples at Amazon, HPE, and IBM aren’t isolated incidents. They’re part of a growing trend where AI hype is fueling permanent staffing decisions based on limited pilots and, mostly, theoretical technological promises rather than full-fledged implementation realities. The heart of the problem? Most executives can’t actually distinguish between what AI can do and what requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship management. Here’s the twist: The executives making these cuts often don’t believe that AI is a replacement for employees. According to Forrester’s State Of AI Survey, 2025, 75% of business leaders agree that AI isn’t a replacement for employees, and 80% agree that AI will mostly augment capabilities rather than replace them. Yet paradoxically, 58% have slowed their hiring until they know more about how AI will impact their operations. This disconnect between stated beliefs and actual decisions reveals the real motivation for AI-driven downsizing — it’s not solely about AI capabilities; it’s about AI as cover for workforce optimization, too. This contradiction highlights why organizations need to ground their workforce AI strategy in human experience rather than chasing theoretical efficiency gains that are likely to fail to materialize or backfire. But let me be clear: AI is delivering value today. In B2B marketing, we see it being used for content development, competitive intelligence, routine task automation, mining customer data insights, and other use cases. But it is far too early to justify major across-the-board headcount changes based on nascent efforts. Organizations and individuals who want to survive this shift must move beyond reactive thinking. Here’s what you should do in the next 30–90 days: Ready to future-proof your marketing organization against the next wave of workforce optimization? Contact me to discuss data-driven strategies for navigating the AI personnel and automation revolution in B2B marketing. Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.

Δ Those cuts happened Thursday (July 17), Reuters reported, citing two sources. A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the cuts in a statement to PYMNTS. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the statement said. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” The company also pointed out that it is continuing to hire in other areas, including within AWS. While the Reuters report notes that the layoffs came one month after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence AI would lead to job cuts, the company insisted to PYMNTS that these cuts were not related to AI, but rather the results of a review on areas that could be streamlined. Several workers told Reuters they had gotten emails on Thursday morning that notified them they had been let go and their computers were being deactivated. Reuters said it could not determine the full scope of the layoffs but added at least one group, known as “specialists,” was impacted. These employees work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. The report noted that the cuts put Amazon in the company of a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike to announce job cuts this year. Jassy on June 17 had sent a message to employees telling them that workers who have learned to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. He added that the company’s corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company embraces AI, which he described as the most transformative technology to come along since the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Other executives have offered starker warnings, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who told the Aspen Ideas Festival that “artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, as seen in the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” shows that 54% of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The research also found that 38% were worried the technology could eventually bring about the elimination of their specific jobs.

Amazon.com Inc. has begun cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as the tech giant recalibrates its priorities in the face of growing artificial intelligence-related expenses, as per a report. According to a statement provided to Bloomberg by company spokesperson Brad Glasser on Thursday, the layoffs are affecting several teams within AWS, the world's largest cloud services provider. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” Glasser said via email, as per the news outlet. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition.” The job cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations while continuing to invest in innovation. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Glasser added, as per the news publication. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had signaled this direction earlier. In June, he stated that the company expects a reduction in its workforce over the coming years as it leverages artificial intelligence to automate a growing number of internal tasks. Amazon is the latest among major tech companies to trim headcount in response to the shifting cost dynamics of AI development and deployment, underscoring the complex tradeoffs between automation, innovation, and human capital. As of the end of March, Amazon reportedly was the second-largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with a total workforce of 1.56 million. While the majority are warehouse employees handling packing and shipping, over 350,000 hold corporate positions. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp. — another tech giant heavily investing in AI — initiated a new round of layoffs affecting approximately 9,000 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction this year.

Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday, two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” AWS sales rose 17% in the first quarter to $29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23% to $11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers.

Amazon.com Inc. is cutting jobs in its cloud-computing division, the latest big tech company to pare its headcount amid rising costs for artificial intelligence. The firings affected various teams at Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing service, company spokesperson Brad Glasser said Thursday. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS” he said in an emailed statement. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition. These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in June that he expected Amazon’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the company uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp., which has also been spending lavishly on AI, began job cuts that will impact about 9,000 workers, its second major wave of layoffs this year. Reuters, citing people familiar with the situation, earlier reported that the Amazon job cuts will affect hundreds of people. The company declined to say how many positions are being eliminated. Amazon is the largest private employer in the US after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most of those people work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but more than 350,000 of them worked in corporate jobs.

Amazon laid off employees in its cloud-computing unit, the company confirmed on Thursday, and employees are trying to piece together the details in internal messages. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the company is laying off employees in AWS, but did not specify which teams were affected or how many employees were cut. Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest the affected teams include frontline support, training and certification, and the AWS Worldwide Specialist Organization, which works with customers and product teams. Some of the employees who wrote on Slack that they were laid off said their roles included work on marketing, analytics, and even generative AI. Amazon did not respond to a request to confirm. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS," Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said. "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." The cuts come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains." Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, said the cuts aren't primarily due to AI and the company has thousands of job listings posted in areas it deems more strategic. Glasser also said U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, and will be eligible for a severance payment. The company has yet to respond to a request about what makes an employee eligible. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Luckily, according to billionaire Daniel Lubetzky, there remains plenty of opportunity for Gen Z—if they look in the right places. “For those people that have great ideas or great opportunities and don’t want to go to college, I don’t think college is an end all, be all or required thing,” Lubetzky the newest judge on Shark Tank, tells Fortune. Despite making a name for himself in entrepreneurship by selling his snack company KIND to Mars in 2020 for $5 billion, Lubetzky says young people could make a killing going down the skilled trade route. “Vocational training and learning how to be a carpenter or a mechanic or any of those jobs is a huge field with huge opportunities that pays really, really well,” he adds. Lubetzky is on the money: While jobs like software engineer or graphic designer may be harder to come by in the coming years thanks to AI job replacements, fields in the skilled trade space are thriving in part off an increased demand for data centers. Plus, with often only an apprenticeship or on-the-job training required, it could be an accessible way for professionals to transition their careers and gain six-figure salaries. While the skilled trade industry isn’t foolproof—and is still plagued with seasonality and safety hazards—job openings remain high. The U.S. construction industry alone had 245,000 job openings in May 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The manufacturing sector had over 414,000 jobs. While Gen Z may have grown up with aspirations to attend an Ivy League and then land a top Silicon Valley job, that reality may have been a disservice to young people—and many have felt this the hard way. So far this year, over 80,000 tech workers have experienced layoffs. To rub salt in the wound, leaders such as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have been transparent that AI is making it easier than ever to reduce corporate ranks. “We’ve made a mistake in society in not sufficiently celebrating builders, not just builders of schools and of KIND bars, but builders of physical bridges and builders of gears,” Lubetzky says. “We in society need to start celebrating those professionals more.” The 56-year-old adds that universities have “failed us” over the last 20 to 30 years by neglecting to teach young people how to be critical thinkers and listeners—or in his words, a “builder’s mindset,” meaning prioritizing curiosity, creativity, compassion and courage. “Having a builder’s mindset is so essential to our society and under curiosity fits critical thinking, critical listening, all of those things,” Lubetzky stresses. The skilled trade industry has the potential to be a safe haven from AI’s revolution on white-collar work. In fact, many young people have already seen the writing on the wall, with enrollment at trade-focused institutions increasing almost 20% since the spring of 2020, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. However, the career path may not be as lucrative as some promise it to be. Trade roles are among the worst entry-level U.S. jobs, according to a new WalletHub study. Welders, automotive mechanics, boilermakers bottomed out on the list, thanks in part to their lack of growth potential and high job hazard. Trade industries also have high unemployment levels due to their seasonal nature, as well as reportedly lower levels of happiness. But either way, Lubetzky says trying something out and deciding you don’t like it—or failing—can be critical to advancing through your career. “Sometimes a failure is more valuable than a success,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Business A logo for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen at the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France on Jun 12, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Benoit Tessier) SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon cut at least hundreds of jobs in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit on Thursday (Jul 17), two sources said, just a month after CEO Andy Jassy warned that adoption of generative AI tools would trigger a workforce reduction. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed it had cut jobs but did not provide a number. Amazon, which employed 1.6 million full- and part-time workers globally as of the end of March, has joined a growing list of firms, including Microsoft, Meta, and CrowdStrike in announcing layoffs this year. Many corporations are increasingly using artificial intelligence to write code for their software and adopting AI agents to automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people.

Loading “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable". "Wherever possible, we’ve worked hard to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are impacted," it added. AWS sales rose 17 per cent in the first quarter to US$29.3 billion compared to a year earlier and operating income rose 23 per cent to US$11.5 billion. Several employees told Reuters they had received emails on Thursday morning that told them they had been terminated and their computers were being deactivated. While Reuters could not determine the full scope of the layoffs, at least one group, known as “specialists,” was affected. Specialists work with customers to help create new product ideas and sell existing services. Several groups within AWS were part of the layoffs, Amazon said. Amazon has been making piecemeal job cuts, most recently in its books, devices and services unit, as well as its Wondery podcast division. Jassy is reducing what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by eliminating managers. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” the Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” In response to CNA queries, Amazon said on Friday it is "following local processes and regulations, including consultation processes, in countries where applicable".

Title: Microsoft is on track to become the second $4 trillion company by market cap, following NVIDIA — and mass layoffs

Microsoft's share price rose over 19% this year so far, vastly outperforming the overall market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA might have clinched the world-first $4 trillion crown, but Microsoft could be hot on its heels. As stock performance goes, Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella has been a shining star, for better or worse. Microsoft's market capitalization as of writing is $3.758 trillion, putting it just shy of NVIDIA's $4.179 trillion. Microsoft has comfortably began to outpace Apple, at $3.1 trillion, as investors get nervous about Apple's position (or lack thereof) in a world increasingly dominated by AI. Indeed, NVIDIA and Microsoft's market position in recent times has been driven by cloud services. NVIDIA providing the hardware, and Microsoft providing the software, in essence. NVIDIA's server technology is powering the global artificial intelligence goldrush. Microsoft's Azure data center operations, in combination with its OpenAI partnership, is powering the back end for hundreds of thousands of Azure customer — and millions of their customers by extension. Indeed, Apple itself is reportedly leveraging Azure and OpenAI's models to power some of its platform features, showing the virtue of Satya Nadella's big cloud investment strategy. Microsoft's share price has risen by over 15% this year as of writing, which has beaten the S&P 500 index by a comfortable amount. Microsoft's stock has become a hot ticket in recent years owing to big dividend payouts and stock buyback programs. Those who invested back at the start of the cloud goldrush have made mountains of profits with Microsoft stock, and that looks set to continue as cloud underpins practically every new technological leap. Without cloud, there's no AI, there's no Netflix, no Amazon, no web services, apps, online games, and so on — and its this that has driven Microsoft to market capitalization dominance in recent years. Microsoft has also invested heavily in subscription-based services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure platforms, and even Xbox Game Pass — giving it reliable and steady revenue that outperforms retail trends and provides resilience against consumer confidence, to a degree. But there's still risk factors involved. Some analysts regard Microsoft stock as overly expensive right now, which is probably partially why Microsoft has had so many layoffs this past year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Boosting margins and increasing profits-per-employee is a short-term way to grow into its valuation, but as I wrote last week, the chilling effect its layoffs has on employee morale and product quality could do long-term harm. Windows, Xbox, Surface, and other consumer-facing Microsoft products have stagnated in some ways, some more than others — leaving the diversification of Microsoft's business vulnerable. One has to wonder just how much of Microsoft's current strategy revolves around boosting the stock price, given exec pay packets are often tied to stock, rather than actually providing high-quality products. You'd think the stock price would go hand in hand with high-quality products, but many of Microsoft's existing offerings, particularly in the consumer segment, leave a lot to be desired. Its enviable second place position in cloud isn't guaranteed either, as Google and others rapidly invest in catching up. Google also doesn't need to rely on OpenAI for its AI models either, potentially giving it an advantage when it comes to innovating new products. There's also been jitters that agentic AI, that is, AI that can basically fully replace humans, might paradoxically impact some of Microsoft's enterprise software businesses. Microsoft has shown itself to be adaptable and versatile when navigating new technological paradigms, but this rapid shifting of priorities has often been viewed as presenting inconsistent and unreliable to consumers. Microsoft's business to business operations remain its core strength, regardless, and it's likely this fact that will drive its market capitalization above $4 trillion in the coming weeks or months ahead. But things can change rapidly in tech, even for big players like Microsoft. Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Title: Retail sales rebound in June after 2 straight months of declines
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/retail-sales-june-increase-0-6-percent-tariffs-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T13:44:42Z
Full Content:
Consumers picked up their spending in June after an earlier pullback, despite anxiety over tariffs and the state of the U.S. economy. Retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after two consecutive months of spending declines, a 0.1% pullback in April and a 0.9% slowdown in May. Retail was buoyed earlier in the year by car sales as Americans attempted to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. The erratic consumer spending is taking place during a period of mixed signals about the economy as well. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, but the U.S. job market is proving to be very resilient, and major tariffs keep getting postponed. Healthy spending continues, with a heavy focus on necessities, rather than electronics or new appliances. Yet consumers haven’t completely cut out spending on nonessential goods. Sales at restaurants, the lone services component within the Census Bureau report and a barometer of discretionary spending, rose moderately. “Consumers are only feeling a modest amount of pressure from tariffs, and any weakness here is not having much of an effect in forcing them to pull back on more discretionary areas of spending such as restaurants and bars,” wrote William Blair’s macro analyst Richard de Chazal. Yet Chazal fears that the administration may be picking up false assurances from strong consumer spending. Consumer sentiment and markets have tumbled after aggressive tariff announcements, and many economist expect rising prices will have a greater impact on consumers before the year is over. Retail sales in June included a 1.2% gain in sales of autos and auto parts. Spending expanded across most major categories including clothing and personal care. Excluding autos and automotive parts, sales rose 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department Clothing and accessories sales rose 0.9%, while health and personal care sales saw a 0.5% bump. Online retailers recorded a 0.4% gain. Electronics and appliance retailers, furniture stores and department stores all saw sales declines. The products sold in these sectors are heavily imported. A category of sales that excludes volatile sectors such as gas, cars, and restaurants rose last month by 0.5% from the previous month. The figure feeds into the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s consumption estimate and is sign that consumers are still spending on some discretionary items. Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that layoffs remain low and consumers are still confident enough that the economy is chugging along. “Don’t count the American consumer out yet,” said Long in a statement. “There’s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal. The word of the summer for the economy is resilient.” The retail sales report arrives amid a whipsaw frenzy of on and off again tariffs have that jolted businesses and households. Business owners say it’s become very difficult to manage supplies and inventories. Americans, when they do shop, are generally steering clear of the things they don’t absolutely need. The latest government report showed that inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump’s sweeping tariffs push up the costs of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into reducing short-term interest rates. Yet the new inflation data makes it increasingly likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are for at least a bit longer. Powell has said that he wants to measure the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs on prices before reducing borrowing costs. A notable litmus test about the state of the consumer was Amazon’s four-day Prime event along with competing retail sales from the likes of Walmart and Target that kicked off last week. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online sales, reported that the sales events drove $24.1 billion in online spending, a 30.3% increase compared with the same period last year. And again, those who were spending prioritized essentials like dish soap and paper products over big-ticket purchases, according to consumer data provider Numerator, based on its analysis of Amazon Prime orders. Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research, said she’s becoming more optimistic about the financial health of the consumer after the big retail events. She said inventories are at a healthy level, and she didn’t see big fire sales. ”People aren’t buying things that they don’t need,” she said. “I think it’s a healthier retail environment.” Retailers are now turning their attention to the back-to-school shopping season, which is the second largest consumer rush after the winter holidays. Coresight Research estimates that total U.S. back-to-school spending will increase by 3.3% year compared with the year-ago period, to $33.3 billion. And it predicts that shoppers will do a big chunk of their shopping before August to get ahead of tariffs. Economists will also dissect quarterly financial reports next month from major retailers like Walmart, Target and Macy’s, both for consumer behavior and to gauge how businesses are navigating a chaotic period of global trade due to fluid U.S. policies. Levi Strauss & Co. said last week that it was cutting back on making styles that aren’t selling and making targeted price increases as it moves production away from China due to tariffs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: You’re Not Imagining It: AI Is Already Taking Tech Jobs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/07/17/ai-tech-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-07-17T10:30:00Z

ByRichard Nieva ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Between meetings in April, Micha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn’t mince words: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too,” he wrote. “This is a wakeup call.” The memo detailed Kaufman’s thesis for AI — that it would elevate everyone’s abilities: Easy tasks would become no-brainers. Hard tasks would become easy. Impossible tasks would become merely hard, he posited. And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. In the shuffle, people who didn’t adapt would be “doomed.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me — that they aren’t imagining stuff.” Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate; the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. It isn’t just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going forward; Chen notes too that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring,” said Chen, adding that companies are starting to focus more on employing experts in their fields. “The superstar workers are in a better position.” Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR company ADP, to examine generative AI’s impact on the workforce. The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century. Now suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers, rather than replace them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” over the next few years as the company begins to “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can’t be automated by AI. Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and automation. At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had slashed its workforce 40%, in part due to investments in AI. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring. The superstar workers are in a better position.” Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its workforce. The company didn’t explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech. Automating customer service at call centers alone, for example, saved more than half a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written by AI. “This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities,” one laid off Microsoft employee told Forbes. Microsoft didn’t respond to questions about the reasons behind its layoffs, but said in a statement: “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company. The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff plans. Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still be trying to correct for overhiring. According to one report released earlier this month by the executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, AI may be more of a scapegoat than a true culprit for layoffs: Of more than 286,000 planned layoffs this year, only 20,000 were related to automation, and of those, only 75 were explicitly attributed to artificial intelligence, the firm found. Plus, it’s challenging to measure productivity gains caused by AI, said Stanford’s Chen, because while not every employee may have AI tools officially at their disposal at work, they do have unauthorized consumer versions that they may be using for their jobs. While the technology is beginning to take a toll on developers in the tech industry, it’s actually “modestly” created more demand for engineers outside of tech, said Chen. That’s because other sectors, like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, are adopting AI tools for the first time, so they are adding engineers to their ranks in larger numbers than before, according to her research. Automating jobs has its limits, too. Last year, Klarna said that the company’s AI tools were doing the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents. But a year later, the company seemed to reverse course, announcing a recruitment drive to hire more human agents. CEO Siemiatkowski has denied the new hiring push meant the company was pulling back on AI. Instead, he said the new human agents would handle more of the higher-end conversations the company had previously outsourced. Siemiatkowski was not available for an interview, but Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom defended the strategy. “We rely on AI just as much,” she said in a statement. “However, we have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” she continued, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Klarna’s experiments show that deciphering which tasks are more suitable for humans, and which can be entrusted to machines, is an open question. Siemiatkowski has been one of the most vocal proponents of automation: to prove the point, when Klarna announced first-quarter earnings in May, he didn’t even show up. Instead, he arranged for an AI deepfake of himself to give the financial update and trumpet a profitable three months. The upside to the upheaval, Fiverr’s Kaufman said, is that people seem willing to learn. (The company hasn’t done any AI-related layoffs or hiring freezes, he told Forbes.) In his memo to employees, he said he would hold office hours to discuss the changing AI landscape with anyone who wanted to chat. He booked a conference room for 50 people. To his surprise, he showed up to find 250 employees waiting for him. “So it was just, ‘All right, let’s do this,’” Kaufman said. He told employees they needed to be proactive to learn new AI techniques, and not just wait to be taught. “I'm going to help anyone who is motivated to help themselves.”

Title: The ex-Amazon employee who's helped nearly 4,000 laid-off workers score jobs

A few years after Amir Satvat landed his first video-game job at the age of 38, layoffs started piling up across the industry at companies such as Xbox maker Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. Seeing many of his new peers let go, he became motivated to lend a hand. Satvat built a website and filled it with a range of free resources tailored for out-of-work game talent. It includes two still-growing lists — one of job postings and another with contact information for hundreds of people he enlisted to provide support, such as résumé reviews and mock interviews. "I was like, what if I made the most comprehensive job listing site ever?" Satvat told Business Insider of his thinking when he got started on the initiative in late 2022. "I'm good at modeling, scraping the internet." Satvat also created a Discord group for the site's users to network with each other and he's given away thousands of tickets to industry events that he acquired by partnering with their organizers. He said he doesn't charge or make any money off his career site, describing it as a purely philanthropic side hustle. Based on user feedback, Satvat said his efforts to date appear to have helped around 3,900 ousted game-industry workers find new jobs, a feat that earned him the inaugural Game Changer award at last year's annual Game Awards show in Los Angeles and this year's Giving Award from the nonprofit Games for Change in New York. Those honors come as the game industry has been grappling with an exceptionally high volume of layoffs. An estimated 37,600 jobs have been shed since 2022, according to an online tally of termination announcements and media reports compiled by Farhan Noor, a technical artist in California. Like employers in many other industries, game companies overhired during the pandemic but other factors have contributed to the cuts, too, such as rising production and marketing costs. Satvat has been a gamer since he was a kid, and by high school, he knew he wanted to work in the industry despite not having artistic inclinations. "I just liked business stuff," he said. But after earning undergraduate and graduate business degrees, he couldn't find any game jobs near where he lived on the East Coast, and staying close to family was a nonnegotiable. "I come from a very tight knit diaspora of a Persian community," he said. Satvat spent several years in business-development roles outside gaming, most recently in a remote one at Amazon's cloud-computing unit. In late 2020, after his first year at Amazon, a colleague introduced him to Ethan Evans, a leader in the company's gaming division. Satvat explained that he was a devoted player of franchises like "World of Warcraft" and "The Legend of Zelda," and the conversation ultimately landed him the kind of job he'd long desired. "It was transparent how much he knew the [game] community and loved it," said Evans, who also didn't start his career in gaming and is now an executive coach. Satvat "wasn't trying to get a promotion. He was trying to move from one thing to another to get closer to something he wanted to do." About a year later, though, Satvat reluctantly resigned from Amazon because the Seattle-based company began mandating in-office attendance, which meant he'd have to relocate. He said he was fortunate to quickly land his current job, a remote business-development position at Chinese game giant Tencent. The person who previously had it reached out over LinkedIn to say he'd just left the company and that Satvat should apply for the role. Satvat later learned that this person found him through mutual LinkedIn connections and was aware of his career site. Now 43, married, and the father of three boys, Satvat works out of his home in Connecticut and continues to spend about 15 to 20 hours every week updating his career site. He also gets help from about 20 volunteers who are aligned with the project's mission of "empowering gamers at every stage of their career." Satvat told BI that it was his successful mid-life pivot to gaming from enterprise software and earlier, healthcare, that made him confident he could become a de facto career guru. When asked for his best advice for job seekers, including those looking to change industries, he pointed to old-fashioned networking. "Spend all your time meeting people," Satvat said. "Every single job I've gotten has been through a relationship."Correction: July 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date Satvat met Evans. It was late 2020, not 2021. Jump to

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: How Microsoft, Google, and Meta are plotting for the AI era

Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Six months into 2025, the tech industry has seen thousands of layoffs as giants such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, IBM, PwC, and Chegg Inc. make sweeping cuts. While AI replacing humans is often cited as the culprit, experts say the reality is more complex: these companies are freeing up capital to hire AI instead. It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce. Microsoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by another 9,000 in July—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce. CEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes 20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code. This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an $80 billion AI infrastructure push this year. Industry experts like Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments. Tech commentator Wes Roth echoed the sentiment: “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including Amazon flattening management layers and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones. Das and Roth did not respond to requests for comment. IBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making. Google and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and Google reducing hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and invest in AI as key reasons. PwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC cutting approximately 1,500 jobs and Chegg reducing its workforce by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools. As AI becomes more central to business operations, tech companies are redefining what productivity means. Tech CEOs and thought leaders have been outspoken this year about how AI is reshaping their sector with the unambiguous message that at least some jobs are being fundamentally displaced. There is still a debate about whether they are being eliminated for good. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer,” capable of writing code. Andy Jassy said Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” while Ford’s Jim Farley and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei separately predicted that AI is set to displace essentially half of all white-collar positions. It’s not all doomsday predictions. Bill Gates see an era of “free intelligence” coming as AI will become capable of handling most tasks. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said AI will “change everyone’s job — it’s changed mine.” The thousands of tech workers that have been laid off so far in 2025 are watching and waiting.

Title: Top U.S. States With Fewest Layoffs And Strongest Job Stability

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. With so much emphasis on massive job layoffs, one group of researchers decided to pinpoint the ... More states with the fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. Many Americans worry on a daily basis about losing their jobs. With over 70K tech layoffs at big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nissan, workers are facing job uncertainty amid persistent volatility of the global labor market—even within some of the world’s most stable and recognizable brands. While labor market volatility is unearthing fears of more layoffs that the American workforce is forced to live with, a new analysis reveals the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. These are places job seekers might want to consider if job stability is a priority in their search. Amid massive layoffs, job security and experience are no longer job guarantees, and the uncertainty is affecting the mental health of the American workforce. Experts have offered several ways you can future-proof your job such as how to remain indispensable or build a side hustle as a safety net. But it’s also helpful to know where fewer layoffs and strong job security exist in case you’re willing to relocate to find greater job stability. The online HR platform Techr analyzed state-level layoff data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for April 2025. The researchers calculated layoffs per 100,000 workers, yielding the states with the most job market stability. They ranked the top ten states from fewest layoffs per 100,000 workers to the most layoffs. “By tracking layoffs per 100,000 workers, we get a clearer picture of where job security is strongest and where models of labor strength might be studied and replicated," a spokesperson for Techr comments. 1. Minnesota ranks first with 754 layoffs per 100,000 workers, 33.7% below the national average of 1,137. In April 2025, Minnesota had a workforce of 3,049,400, with just 23,000 layoffs recorded for the month. 2. Colorado is in second position with 770 layoffs per 100,000 workers. According to the researchers, this number represents a 32.2% drop, compared to the national average of 1,137 laborers. In April 2025, Colorado had a total workforce of 2,988,500 with only 23,000 layoffs recorded. 3. Missouri comes in third place with 800 layoffs per 100,000 workers. This figure is 29.6% lower than the national rate of 1,137, the researchers point out. In April 2025, Missouri had a workforce totaling 2,998,600 of which 24,000 employees were laid off. 4. Wisconsin falls into fourth spot with 852 layoffs per 100,000 workers, falling 25.1% below the national average of 1,137 workers, the researchers note. In April 2025, the total workforce in Wisconsin was 3,050,500 with 26,000 layoffs. 5. Washington rounds out the top five states with 873 layoffs per 100,000 workers. The analysts emphasize that this number is 23.2% lower than the national rate of 1,137. In April 2025, Washington had 32,000 layoffs from its 3,664,100 workforce. 6. Iowa is sixth with 876 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, Iowa saw 14,000 layoffs from its 1,598,500 workforce. No percentage is given for its national rating. 7. Massachusetts ranks seventh with 886 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, there were 33,000 layoffs in the Massachusetts workforce of 3,725,200. 8. Texas follows with 894 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Texas experienced 128,000 layoffs, more than any other of the top ten states out of a workforce of 14,312,700. 9. Pennsylvania claims ninth spot with 916 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Pennsylvania had 57,000 layoffs out of a workforce of 6,221,400. 10. Hawaii rounds out the top ten with 921 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Hawaii saw 6,000 layoffs from its workforce of 651,400. The results of the Techr study clearly show that Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri are experiencing the most employment stability relative to their workforce size. “These low layoff rates may reflect resilient state economies, steady demand in key sectors or effective labor policies," a Techr representative states, adding that, “It’s a positive signal for job seekers and businesses alike.” It’s also interesting to note that another study ranks Missouri as the number one state with the best work-life balance and Missouri and Minnesota in the top three states where citizens enjoy socializing and relaxing. States on the Techr list that enjoy fewer layoffs also show up on other top lists where freelancers thrive. They include Colorado, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Stable job markets by state are important, especially if you’re job hunting from a national radius. They provides an indication of where resilient state economies lie and can support your search for greater job security than is currently available nationwide. If your mental health is compromised, knowing where stable job markets are could be a factor you use in seeking employment. Stable job security supports mental health stability. If you live and work in one of the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs, consider yourself fortunate. If you don’t and are job searching, the rankings might factor into your decision-making about where you decide to seek employment.

Title: Siemens’ CTO says AI can help address the U.S. manufacturing industry’s big skills gap

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. A key policy goal of President Donald Trump’s administration is bringing jobs back to American factories, though the effort has been mired in a years-long slog despite support from both Democratic and Republican administrations. But even beyond the challenge of getting large, multinational companies to reroute their complex supply chains, there’s a large and unsolved skills gap problem to address even if these U.S. manufacturing jobs were to proliferate. Peter Koerte, the chief technology officer and chief strategy officer at German technology conglomerate Siemens AG, points to research that shows that the average tenure of a U.S. manufacturing worker has slipped from 20 years in 2019 to just 3 years in 2023. “Which means that most of the people that you find—and in particular if we want to bring back manufacturing to the United States—they’re unskilled,” says Koerte. “Because nobody wants to have a factory job.” Official government figures are less dire, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the median tenure of a manufacturing worker dropped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years a decade later. But regardless, manufacturing workers are coming to work each day with a lot less expertise than those who worked similar jobs decades ago. This led Siemens to launch a pilot program in 2024 for an industrial-focused AI copilot, helping engineering teams to search Siemens manuals in natural language to troubleshoot problems on the factory floor. This year, the company expanded the effort by launching an industrial foundational model that was specifically designed for industrial applications. As an example, this AI tool can be used by a worker who is trying to figure out what to do when a machine breaks down. The employee can input information about the machine and the error code that’s on display, and then retrieve detailed instructions on how to address the issue. Less downtime for machines saves factories time and money. The use of AI in this manner also democratizes engineering expertise. “You don’t need to have the very deep domain know-how that prevents you from using those systems,” says Koerte. “It levels the playing field.” Koerte has had a long career at Siemens, joining the company in 2007 as a corporate strategist and taking on several leadership roles before ascending to the CTO and CSO titles in 2020. He says he’s remained at Siemens for such a large portion of his career because he’s inspired by the company’s ability to continually reinvent itself over its 178-year history. Siemens began as a telecommunications company that built the infrastructure that made it possible to send a telegram from London to Calcutta in just 28 minutes, a momentous breakthrough in the mid-1800s. Today, Siemens is known for selling machinery and software that support massive industries including the power and gas sectors, healthcare, and building and freight projects, ranging from supporting a 2,000-kilometer high-speed railway that’s being built in Egypt to an automotive Mercedes-Benz plant in Berlin. The advancement of generative AI presents yet another opportunity for reinvention, says Koerte. Koerte says Siemens was an early adopter of more traditional forms of AI that have been used for many years in manufacturing, including to perform quality inspections or to ensure that buildings are using energy as efficiently as possible. Before the generative AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Siemens had more than 1,500 AI experts on staff. Along that journey, Siemens has embraced a wide variety of AI partners, including heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon Web Services, as well as European-based AI companies and large language model makers in China. Microsoft has been an especially critical partner, Koerte says, offering engineering expertise and insights into how to commercialize the company’s industrial AI offerings. Software development ranks as a high priority use case for generative AI. The company’s software developer workforce of about 27,000 employees have been using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and the productivity lift from those tools ranges between 10% to 30%, says Koerte. Across the broader workforce, there are 460 distinct AI use cases in production today, a figure that excludes the unique AI chatbots that workers can create to perform tasks through a secure system that’s called SiemensGPT. In total, over 15,000 unique bots have been created by Siemens employees since October 2024. “We have it pretty much everywhere,” says Koerte of AI’s pervasiveness. “The question is, how much have we saved?” That’s not yet completely resolved and most surveys of CTOs and chief information officers show that the return on investment for generative AI projects isn’t as clear as they’d like it to be. But Siemens has set a north star goal. Before the influence of generative AI, the company had an annual productivity gain target of 3% to 4% across the business. But Koerte says with AI, the hope is to double that aspirational range. He believes that parts of the economy that have big skills gaps will reap the most benefits of AI. When Siemens launched an AI-enabled assistant tool to help radiologists detect diseases, the greatest adoption came from underdeveloped countries where there were far fewer specialists. “You always have to look at necessity, where the biggest challenge and necessity is,” says Koerte. “Because then people have to look at it differently. And they have to change.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI’s expensive talent war heats up. Google, Meta, and OpenAI are among the AI hyperscalers throwing big bucks to lure lucrative AI talent, as highlighted by Google’s $2.4 billion deal to hire the leaders of AI coding tool Windsurf and pay for the nonexclusive license for the startup’s technology. Days later, Cognition swooped in to buy the rest of Windsurf, though terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. OpenAI was also reportedly in talks with Windsurf, discussions that broke down because of concerns about having to share its products with Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor. Separately, OpenAI has lured four top engineers from rivals Tesla, xAI, and Meta; while Bloomberg reports of a $200 million pay package that was given to former Apple engineer Ruoming Pang, who ran the company’s AI models team. Meta has also recently hired more than 10 OpenAI researchers and experts from Anthropic, Google, and other startups, the news outlet reports. AI has an impact on jobs, but just how much? Over the past week, job cuts continued to be attributed to the gains companies are achieving from their investments in AI, with a report from Bloomberg highlighting internal comments from within Microsoft that says AI has saved the tech giant more than $500 million in its call centers alone. Microsoft has also cut about 15,000 employees this year. Meanwhile, roughly 1,300 jobs were cut at job search and employee review companies Indeed and Glassdoor, as parent company Japan’s Recruit Holdings told employees that AI is “changing the world” and that the company must adapt with the evolution of that technology. But CIO Dive reports that outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas’ figures for the first half of 2025 found that only 75 out of 20,000 jobs cut by U.S.-based companies were explicitly attributed to AI (though it notes that the cause of many layoffs may be classified in broader terms). The trade outlet reports that companies are using the term “technological update” more frequently, possibly to avoid negative press of replacing workers with AI. Nvidia hits $4 trillion valuation ahead of CEO’s trip to China. The AI chip maker became the world’s first publicly traded company to hit a $4 trillion market capitalization last week, reflecting an astonishing gain of 1,460% over the past five years. The latest stock market milestone comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang finds himself quite a bit in the news over the past several days, culminating with Monday's news that the U.S. government has lifted restrictions on Nvidia selling its H20 GPUs to China. Huang also recently sat down with CNN, where he was asked about a warning from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white collar jobs within five years. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” says Huang. Meanwhile, struggling chip maker Intel lays off 4,000. Nvidia’s rival Intel, which has lagged in the AI chips race, announced layoffs across four states affecting engineers, researchers, middle management, and factory workers. Last week, The Oregonian reported that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan told employees during an internal broadcast, in response to a question about company culture, that things had gotten so bleak that Intel was “not in the top 10 semiconductor companies.” He added that customers were giving Intel poor marks and cautioned that a turnaround would be a “marathon” that would require some humility. Intel’s market capitalization greatly lags Nvidia at just around $100 billion today. AI agents are proliferating and most companies prefer a mix of internal and off-the-shelf solutions. KPMG’s second-quarter AI pulse survey found that nine out of ten companies are past AI agent experimentation, with 33% fully deploying at least some agents (up from 11% for the past two consecutive quarters), with another 57% of organizations piloting AI agents. “All agents aren’t created equal,” cautions Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG, in an interview with Fortune. “You’re seeing a lot of task agents being deployed, which are more simplified use cases.” With more organizations moving to the piloting or deployment stages, Lohr says the obstacles to make AI agents a reality are becoming more clear, including technical skills gaps (59% surveyed), followed by workforce resistance to change (47%), and system complexity (39%). When it comes to how companies are actually deploying these agentic workflows—which can perform more complex tasks than prompt-based AI chatbots—the Big Four accounting firm says more leaders are planning to deploy a combination of internally built and off-the-shelf agents (up 51% from 27% in the first quarter). Just 2% plan to only build agents internally. Hiring: - EchoStar is seeking a CIO, based in Englewood, Colorado.

Title: A millennial made $300,000 secretly working multiple jobs — while tasked with catching others doing the same

Full Content:
Eric was paid to catch employees secretly working multiple jobs. Then he became one of them. A few years ago, Eric was working in an IT role at a large company. His job responsibilities included investigating three types of "illicit employment" within the organization: workers who outsourced their job responsibilities to overseas contractors, foreign actors who infiltrated companies by posing as legitimate hires, and employees secretly juggling multiple jobs without the company's approval. But there wasn't much suspicious activity to investigate, Eric said, and he was working as little as one hour each day. Then he had an idea: What if he took on a second job to boost his income? While Eric considered it, he initially held back because he was worried about getting caught. But that changed the following year, when his employer asked him to focus more on detecting job jugglers, and he realized just how difficult they were to identify. After weighing the risks, Eric applied for and landed a remote role, bringing his combined annual income to roughly $300,000. He said he worked only a couple of hours a day across the jobs. In addition to the financial benefits, Eric said he took the second job to gain an inside look at the "overemployed" world, one that might help him identify job jugglers. He said the firsthand experience helped him catch several employees who were ultimately fired. But this success came with a growing problem for Eric, one that ultimately cut his job-juggling journey short. He feared the very system he was building to catch others would end up catching him, and jeopardize his career. "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder," said Eric, whose identity, employment, and income were verified by Business Insider, but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing fears of professional repercussions. "It was a wild time in my life." Eric, a millennial in the US, is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple jobs to increase their incomes. Over the past three years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra cash to travel the world, buy expensive weight-loss drugs, and pay down student debt. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. Additionally, tech layoffs and return-to-office mandates have created obstacles for current and aspiring job jugglers. But many overemployed workers have told BI that the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

While his initial concerns about getting caught eased enough for him to accept the second role, he still worried that he'd eventually be exposed. "I thought I could make some money real quick and get out," he said. But Eric feared that if his savings started ballooning because of his two incomes, he'd get "emotionally attached" to the extra earnings, making it harder to walk away. His solution was to spend freely on things he'd normally avoid. He said he viewed job juggling like renting a luxurious car: fun while it lasts, but not something you do forever. "I was ordering stuff off Amazon all the time," he said. "It was like expendable income." In addition to unlocking this spending spree, working multiple jobs gave Eric firsthand insight into how people with multiple roles operated — knowledge that helped him sharpen his detection skills and catch job jugglers. "It really wasn't until after I had my second job that I started getting actionable outcomes from my investigations because I just knew exactly what to look for," he said. Eric said he used internal company activity data to look for behavioral patterns that could suggest someone was juggling multiple jobs, such as sudden swings in productivity during specific parts of the day. Some workers were highly active in the morning and quiet all afternoon, or vice versa. His thinking, based partly on his personal experience, was that job jugglers would split time between their two roles. "I'd go back historically and see that at one point they were working all day and now they're not," he said. "So it just came down to behaviors." When an employee's activity seemed suspicious, Eric said, he'd contact their manager and ask how often the worker appeared on camera during meetings, whether they'd missed any lately, and whether their work quality had declined over time. If concerns persisted, he'd suggest the manager schedule a one-on-one video call during the worker's usual inactive hours. If the employee repeatedly asked to delay or reschedule the call, that would raise red flags, and the case could eventually be handed off to HR. Even as Eric's detection capabilities improved, he wasn't too concerned about his own work behaviors being flagged, he said. But that changed when he discovered that a security software program used by both of his employers could detect when multiple devices were running the software on the same home network — an indicator someone could be juggling multiple jobs. While he wasn't certain it would expose him, the realization made him nervous. At the same time, he was having mixed feelings about the ethics of overemployment. So, after less than a year of working two jobs, Eric decided to drop one of his roles. "As I went further and further along, I realized I couldn't keep this up because I was building detections that were going to catch me," he said. While overemployment has become more common because of the rise of remote work, Eric said he doesn't think most companies are particularly concerned about it. His detection work occasionally comes up during job interviews, and from what he's gathered, employers generally believe job jugglers will either drop a job after burning out or reaching a financial goal, or be let go for underperformance. If catching overemployed workers isn't a big priority for most companies, many job jugglers may be able to avoid detection, at least in the short term. Eric said that looking back, he sometimes wonders whether he could have kept going a little longer. "I just felt like I was going to get caught, and I didn't want to lose my entire career, so I had to stop," he said. "But man, I kind of regret it sometimes. It was really good money." Jump to
