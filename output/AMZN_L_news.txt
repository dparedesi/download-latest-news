Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Booming corporate earnings and a slumping labor market have been telling very different stories lately, and AI is the likely explanation, according to Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at Alpine Macro. That dichotomy is exemplified in the tech sector, which has seen profits soar while employment has been in a “recession” for three years, he said in a Monday note titled “A Jobless Profit Boom.” “We suspect that job losses in tech have been driven mainly by AI displacement,” Zhao added, pointing to recent cuts at Amazon, Meta and Salesforce. “These layoffs, however, are happening amid exceptionally strong profit growth in these companies—a significant departure from the past, when job cuts typically followed declining profitability.” This jobless profit boom isn’t limited to the tech sector and has quickly become an economy-wide phenomenon, he said. In fact, while overall private-sector payrolls have rebounded from the early days of COVID, it is still 5% below where the pre-pandemic trend would have been by this time. “In other words, there has been a permanent loss of jobs since the pandemic crisis, even as corporate profits have surged to record highs,” Zhao said. At the same time, productivity has been surging in recent years, and it is currently growing more than twice as fast as it did in the previous decade. Zhao thinks AI is the reason and noted the technology is displacing labor at an accelerating pace. But while labor demand is down, aging demographics and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown have weakened labor supply as well. Those trends have created a new equilibrium that are keeping a lid on unemployment even as hiring stays subdued. “Under normal circumstances, slower labor force growth should weigh on economic growth,” Zhao explained. “However, rising productivity has allowed the U.S. economy to produce more output—and higher profits—with fewer workers.” The analysis from Alpine Macro, which is part of Oxford Economics, reinforces what computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton has been saying about AI’s impact on the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon cancels Lord of the Rings MMO for the second time

The most widespread reaction I've seen to Amazon laying off 30,000 people from its gaming division has been "Amazon had a gaming division?" That isn't surprising in itself; none of Amazon Games' releases (mostly generic fantasy MMOs) ever came close to breaching the mainstream despite massive teams and functionally unlimited budget. We could speculate about why that is all day long, but regardless, Amazon Gaming's biggest shot at becoming a household name was its in-development Lord of the Rings MMO. The same one it just canceled for a second time. The project was killed the first time in 2021 before a turbulent restart, and then again just this week. A LinkedIn post made yesterday by a laid-off developer simultaneously announcing and cancelling the project has since been deleted, but the pertinent parts have been archived: The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she wrote. "It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here." Did some spiteful witch put a curse on The Lord of the Rings that keeps people from making good games based on it or something? It seems the only reasonable explanation. User ratings of New World, Amazon Games' biggest project, have fallen to "Mostly Negative" on Steam in the wake of these layoffs. It's unlikely Amazon will face any repercussions beyond this.

Title: OpenAI, Amazon sign $38bn AI deal
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/3/openai-amazon-sign-38bn-ai-deal
Time Published: 2025-11-03T18:13:50Z

The announcement comes less than week after Amazon laid off 14,000 people. By Andy Hirschfeld and Reuters Share Save OpenAI has signed a new deal valued at $38bn with Amazon that will allow the artificial intelligence giant to run AI workloads across Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. The seven-year deal announced on Monday is the first big AI push for the e-commerce giant after a restructuring last week. The new deal will give the ChatGPT maker access to thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its artificial intelligence models. Experts say this does not mean that it will allow OpenAI to train its model on websites hosted by AWS – which includes the websites of The New York Times, Reddit and United Airlines. “Running OpenAI training inside AWS doesn’t change their ability to scrape content from AWS-hosted websites [which they could already do for anything publicly readable]. This is strictly speaking about the economics of rent vs buy for GPU [graphics processing unit] capacity,” Joshua McKenty, CEO of the AI detection company PolyguardAI, told Al Jazeera. The deal is also a major vote of confidence for the e-commerce giant’s cloud unit, AWS, which some investors feared had fallen behind rivals Microsoft and Google in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Those fears were somewhat eased by the strong growth the business reported in the September quarter. OpenAI will begin using AWS immediately, with all planned capacity set to come online by the end of 2026 and room to expand further in 2027 and beyond. Amazon plans to roll out hundreds of thousands of chips, including Nvidia’s GB200 and GB300 AI accelerators, in data clusters built to power ChatGPT’s responses and train OpenAI’s next wave of models, the companies said. Amazon already offers OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock, which offers multiple AI models for businesses using AWS. OpenAI’s sweeping restructuring last week moved it further away from its non-profit roots and also removed Microsoft’s first right to refusal to supply services in the new arrangement. Amazon’s announcement about an investment in AI comes only days after the company laid off 14,000 people despite CEO Andy Jassy’s comment in an earnings call on Thursday saying the layoffs were not driven by AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said the startup is committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources – enough to roughly power 25 million United States homes. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” said Altman. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” This comes amid growing concerns about the sheer amount of energy demand that AI data centres need to operate. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that AI data centres will use up to 12 percent of US electricity by 2028. An AP/NORC poll from October found that 41 percent of Americans are extremely concerned about AI’s impact on the environment, while another 30 percent say they are somewhat concerned as the industry increases its data centre footprint around the US. Surging valuations of AI companies and their massive spending commitments, which total more than $1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom may be turning into a bubble. OpenAI has already tapped Alphabet’s Google to supply it with cloud services, as Reuters reported in June. It also reportedly struck a deal to buy $300bn in computing power for about five years. While OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft, which the two forged in 2019, has helped push Microsoft to the top spot among its Big Tech peers in the AI race, both companies have been making moves recently to reduce reliance on each other. Neither OpenAI nor Amazon were immediately available for comment. On Wall Street, Amazon’s stock is surging on the news of the new deal. As of 11:15am in New York (16:15 GMT), it is up by 4.7 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Target Is Acting Like A Company Preparing For Acquisition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2025/11/03/target-is-acting-like-a-company-preparing-for-acquisition/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T17:56:26Z

ByChris Walton, Senior Contributor. Target and Amazon each announced layoffs on the same day last week. Tuesday, October 28th, to be exact. Coincidence? I think . . . it is more than likely. But what if it’s not? What if there is more at play here? What if it is a big tell that Amazon could be looking to acquire Target? Or, minimally, that Target is looking to get acquired itself? While this idea might sound crazy, there is more than enough chum in the water to give it credence. First of all, for years people have been hypothesizing that Target would make a great acquisition for Amazon. The first instance I can recall occurred way back in 2018 when Loup Venture’s Gene Munster predicted the e-commerce giant would buy Target. Obviously, that never happened, but ever since then too many pundits to count have encouraged the move, mainly because they all see a synergy with Whole Foods and Target. Newsflash: I do not, but more on that in just a few seconds. No, the far more strategic rationale for a Target acquisition plays right into what Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said late last week. In discussing the success Amazon has been seeing with the rollout of same-day perishable grocery delivery, Jassy said, “This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours.” Sound familiar? It should. Because it sounds exactly why people shop at Target, only the online version of the experience. If I had a nickel for every time someone during my Target career said to me, “I went in for one thing, and left with so much more!” I estimate that, give or take, I’d have about $5,325 by now. Target’s grocery experience has never been designed like Walmart’s or even Kroger’s. Target has never been the place where you can accomplish your full weekly grocery shopping trip. Sure, there are roughly 200 or so Super Targets throughout the country that approximate the Walmart Supercenter experience, but there are also about 1,800 other stores with a much smaller footprint of groceries, with no meat counter, no deli, etc. Said another way, Target has always been about the fill-in grocery trip. Smashing Whole Foods into Target for that reason alone would be a bad move. The stores don’t have the footprint and the retrofit would be quite costly. Second, Target’s supply chain design, i.e. the expansive use of sortation centers, was also designed by ex-Amazon and Target’s former Chief Supply Chain Officer, Arthur Valdez. It is a setup Amazon knows well and one to which Amazon could plug into quite nicely, and one that suddenly gives all its Amazon’s shoppers an “omnichannel” extension into the idea of buying (or picking up at a store) your “milk alongside your electronics.” But all that is just the Amazon side of the story. The recent happenings around Target’s CEO succession are so bizarre that they should give everyone pause, pause to ask, “What the heck is going on here?” For instance, Target’s outgoing CEO Brian Cornell’s track record is questionable at best (see why here), and instead of the board outright replacing him, it allowed Cornell to stay in his role until February 1, 2026 and named Target’s former COO Michael Fiddelke as his replacement, with Cornell then staying on as executive chair. Many, including Wall Street, were hoping the board would look outside for Cornell’s replacement, but instead it went internal and kept Cornell in the mix. Why would the board do this? Well, one reason could be that the board knows something we don’t and doesn’t want to upset the apple cart, an idea that deserves even more credence when we examine the layoffs last week. For all intents and purposes, last week’s layoffs were Fiddelke’s layoffs. Ever since Target announced its succession plan in late August, Fiddelke has been the public leadership face of Target. Knowing retail as I do, however, layoffs of this size and magnitude take months and months of planning, which also means that they had to have been in the works long before the succession announcement was made. All of which begs the next big question – why didn’t Cornell announce the layoffs and then hand over the reins to Fiddelke sometime afterward? Or even time the layoffs earlier? That would have been the move that set Fiddelke up for success. Instead Fiddelke gets saddled with the cultural impact of having to tell the organization that the reason for the layoffs was one of “too many layers and overlapping work slowing decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life,” a rationale that, as the former CFO and COO, Fiddelke had a big hand in creating. Is Fiddelke the right man to lead Target for the long-term, or is he just a temporary stopgap who understands the operations and who, with Cornell peering over his shoulder, can hold things in place until the right suitor comes along? If it is the latter, then Fiddelke is actually the ideal candidate to fulfill the role. He knows the internal workings of Target as well if not better than anyone still working there. If it is the former, then I don’t envy him one bit because Cornell handed him a raging dumpster fire, and it will take a superhero’s effort to bring the culture back and to fix the overall flailing business model at the same time. I asked Target for comment on all this speculation, both on the timing of the layoffs with Amazon as well as on the idea of Target’s leadership team preparing the company for acquisition, but my request for comment was not returned in time for publication. But then again, if any of the speculation were true, why would and, more importantly, how could Target comment? Target couldn’t comment even if it wanted to do so. No matter how one slices it, the situation is so strange at Target right now that, for the benefit of the doubt for all who still work there (Fiddelke included), one has to assume Target is clearing the decks for acquisition, right? What other possible explanation could there be? Because any answer beyond that gets really unsettling, really fast, and doesn’t inspire much confidence in what would result from the proverbial inmates left running the asylum, aka Target’s board and leadership team.

Title: The CEO Revolving Door Speeds Up
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceo/2025/11/03/the-ceo-revolving-door-speeds-up/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T17:12:49Z
Full Content:
ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. It’s a difficult time to be in business, and for many companies, the CEO’s position is becoming a revolving door. According to new data from executive search and leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds shared exclusively with Forbes, 174 global CEOs left their positions just in the quarter. Average CEO tenure declined to 7.2 years in Q3—down more than a year from the average 8.4-year tenure reported just two years ago. Russell Reynolds notes that these results indicate a shift in board governance and investor activism—not necessarily stressed-out CEOs who want to get out of the hot seat. Boards and institutional investors are more closely monitoring CEO effectiveness, making changes earlier than they might have otherwise, and moving quickly if there are dips in company performance or strategic alignment. Many of those CEOs are being replaced by newcomers. Russell Reynolds found that so far in 2025, 88% of new CEOs appointed globally are first-timers. This could be for several reasons, the firm said. Considering the multifaceted challenges of business today, boards may be seeking new perspectives in the CEO’s seat. Experienced CEOs also may also be voluntarily passing on another post, given the extreme scrutiny and pressure that come with the job. However, Russell Reynolds noted, U.S. companies bucked the broader trend, reporting that more former CEOs returning to their previous roles to “steady the ship.” Globally, nearly three-quarters of new CEOs are internal hires. This trend is stronger among companies in the FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225, which saw almost all of their new CEOs moving up an internal succession ladder. U.S. companies made 69% of their hires internally. Russell Reynolds wrote that this shows boards are balancing companies’ needs: whether institutional knowledge and company culture or an outsider’s viewpoint is what’s needed at the moment. Many companies quickly added AI to their call centers, but maybe it’s not the best way to answer often-angry customer calls. I talked to Sam Dorison, CEO and cofounder of ReflexAI, about his company, which uses AI to train the humans that are employed in call centers and why humans should still be working the phones. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The government shutdown continues, and is on track to be the longest ever if it keeps going until Tuesday. However, the big-picture economic costs of the shutdown are starting to surface for millions of Americans. Many more federal workers are missing paychecks and food benefits through the SNAP program have been suspended—though a judge has ordered the Trump Administration to tap emergency program funds to keep benefits flowing. The Congressional Budget Office reported last week that spending losses from the shutdown will cost the U.S. $7 billion to $14 billion in GDP so far. Meanwhile, the subsidy for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act has expired. Democrats have said Republicans’ failure to renew the subsidy is why they oppose reopening the government. Forbes senior contributor Joshua Cohen writes that without the subsidy, premium costs are rapidly increasing: up an average of 17% in states that run their own insurance exchanges, and an increase of 30% for states whose programs are managed by the federal government. Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen writes that companies that offered plans to millions of Americans through the Affordable Care Act are bracing for large losses of customers who can no longer afford coverage—like the two-thirds of customers UnitedHealthcare expects to lose. It’s little surprise that consumer confidence is continuing to drop, falling one point in October to a seven-month low of 94.6, according to the Conference Board. Actual data on the state of the economy is not readily available due to the government shutdown, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on CNN Sunday that he believes some sectors of the economy are either in recession or at risk of one. Bessent placed the blame on the Federal Reserve, which has slowly been rolling back interest rates—too slowly, in Bessent’s opinion. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates by a quarter point for the second month in a row, setting baselines at between 3.75% and 4%. But the decision itself was mixed—10 governors voted for the reduction and two against, with one opposed wanting a half-point cut and the other wanting rates to stay the same. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said another rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion, far from it.” Markets dropped following Powell’s statement, but largely recovered in the days since. Kimberly-Clark announced plans to acquire Tylenol parent company Kenvue for $48.7 billion in a cash and stock deal. This deal would make consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark the world’s second-largest seller of health and wellness products, creating a company with $32 billion in annual revenue. Kimberly-Clark has a wide portfolio of brands, including Kleenex, Huggies, Scott and Cottonelle. Kenvue was spun off of Johnson & Johnson in 2023 and comprised the pharmaceutical manufacturer’s consumer brands—including Tylenol, Aveeno, Band-Aid and Listerine. Kenvue has had a difficult autumn since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. issued a report in September claiming that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy is a cause of autism. Both Kenvue and many physicians and experts have refuted the report, saying it is based on weak and unproven evidence, and that Tylenol is safe for use during pregnancy, though President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on its claims, leading Texas to sue Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, claiming the companies deceptively marketed a risky drug to pregnant women. Prior to the acquisition announcement, Kenvue’s stock had fallen more than 22% since September. Today, its stock is up more than 16%, while Kimberly-Clark stock is down more than 12% after announcing the deal. Kimberly-Clark says the deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026. Online behemoth Amazon announced last week it’s laying off 14,000 corporate staff. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post that the company is performing well but is seeking ways to “remove layers, increase ownership and realize efficiency gains.” This is just the beginning of big changes at Amazon because of AI. Forbes contributor Rachel Wells writes that internal strategy documents first reported on by the New York Times suggest that AI, robots and automation in general will replace 600,000 human jobs at the company by 2033. Wells writes that aside from administrative roles, the jobs most likely targeted by these layoffs include warehouse workers and order fulfillment operatives, as well as entry-level logistics, coding and customer service positions. Galetti’s blog post highlighted the disruptive nature of AI, noting its role in job losses. Forbes contributor Martine Paris points out that other big tech players have also cut positions this year, potentially due to new capabilities from AI. Microsoft’s headcount is down 15,000 employees, and Meta recently cut 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. Goldman Sachs has estimated that 6% to 7% of the U.S. workforce could be displaced by AI and automation, though several executives at the Paley International Council Summit in Silicon Valley late last month said the trajectory wouldn’t be just wholesale job cuts. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said the technology is inherently disruptive, but Microsoft is continuing to hire—though many of those hires are to train AI. A study from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and GBK Collective shows that many CEOs have the same outlook, saying AI will not shrink their workforce or job opportunities. Forbes senior contributor Joe McKendrick reports that fewer than two in 10 executives predict job cuts as a result of AI. In fact, 40% expect AI to boost hiring of entry-level jobs, and a third expect AI to increase executive-level hires. One of the first places many companies add AI is to their customer service call center. Sam Dorison, CEO and cofounder of ReflexAI, is bringing it there, but as a trainer—not replacing humans. Dorison said AI does a great job of handling repetitive tasks, and call center training tends to involve people going through the same simulations over and over again. I spoke with him about how he’s designed AI training and why humans are still needed in the call center. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. For your training, where do you get the data that makes the simulations work and rates how well calls are being responded to? Dorison: You do not need to use any real data to configure simulations. We want to be very clear that it’s our job to serve our customers, not for them to serve us [by uploading their data to our system]. We’ve invested very heavily in a lot behind the scenes. If you think about designing a car, no one needs to tell you that a car has four wheels. But the question is: How big are the wheels? What suspension do you need? Is it a convertible? Is it an SUV? Is it gas? Is it hybrid? Is it electric? As you’re putting together simulations within the platform, you have a huge number of choices and it’s structured for you. It’s not just: Build a car. Good luck. The reason that’s so important is that when someone’s calling a call center, they’re not just upset. Are they frustrated versus angry? Those are two very different emotions. Are they angry because they had one bad experience with your brand, or they’ve had a series of bad experiences? The way that you interact with a customer that’s had one bad experience, you can explain that you’re sorry and that this is a rare occurrence. They’ve had four bad experiences with you over the last month, don't bother explaining to them that it’s rare. All that’s going to do is make them more furious. We walk our customers through [the complexities] you’re designing: Who is the person calling? What’s the situation? How are they going to respond to different types of things that your agents might say? You walk through that process and by the end of it, seven minutes later, you have a simulation that you can deploy to hundreds of people that feels very realistic to your particular center. For the last several years, it’s been harder to talk to a person when you call a customer support line. And nowadays, more companies are adding AI agents instead of having a human for the vast majority of calls. Why do you see that humans should be the ones taking the calls? First and foremost, not everything should be talk-to-a-human. I want a very clear website that can explain it to me. I want a very effective app for some things. I’m fine if I call and I have AI on the other end, and for some things I want a human. If you look at long-term customer retention and satisfaction, you’re significantly better off having them talk to a human. Those [calls] can still be done more efficiently and better. The other thing I would say is that as you have seen and embraced the rise of AI agents, for the things that you do need to talk to a human to solve, the human had better be good at it. If you navigate a phone tree to get to a human, the last thing you want is a human who can’t quickly understand what’s going on for you and be able to solve it. What do you think CEOs need to know about tools like ReflexAI? You have to be clear about what you expect of your team with AI tools, and it can’t just be: Find ways to use AI in work. This means [defining] what are the types of metrics that you want to move? What are the risks that you're willing to incur? If you’re not clear about what risks are acceptable, it’s going to be hard for your team to get excited to incur any risk. Increasing your level of precision and clarity—both on the outcomes you care about and the risks that the organization is prepared to accept—is one thing. The second thing is you have to find a way to put it into performance reviews and hiring. If you don’t, you should not be surprised if you don’t get anywhere. That means not just having a question on performance reviews about innovation, but it means telling people on January 1 that in reviews on December 15, you will answer the question: How have you implemented new AI tools to improve business outcomes by at least X percent? Let people know they’re going to be evaluated against it, because that’s what people are looking for. They care about that, as well as care about the business outcomes. The third piece is: you have to look for partnerships, too. That the ability to reinvent the wheel with AI is basically 100%. You can spend all of your time solving problems that have already been solved. If every organization sets out to do the same thing over and over again, don’t be surprised when your organization is slower than someone else, or that you have higher costs, versus if you can find strategic partners. For us, what’s important is that we can say to our customers: The problems that you have, we’ve thought about across the country, with lots of different types of organizations. It’s similar to a CRM. You can physically build your own CRM. Any organization can build it, just throw software engineering money at it. But why are you building your own CRM in this day and age? AI tooling is a similar world. It’s certainly hard to find AI engineers, but why are you spending all this money on your internal team when you can very rapidly use something that’s there, and let your team get back to their actual work? There’s been a lot of controversy swirling around the decision to have Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny perform at next year’s Super Bowl, with many asking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to change the Big Game’s halftime headliner. Most CEOs face this type of dilemma—though they’re often much less publicized. Here are some takeaways from how Goodell is handling it so far. There’s a new person formerly known as Prince: King Charles III’s brother Andrew, who was formally stripped of his title last week due to his previous association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The monarch had to walk a tightrope to distance himself and the British throne from the scandal, and his decision-making process could be useful to CEOs navigating controversies brought on by others.

Title: Entering The Age of The Ozempic Company

Time Published: 2025-11-03T14:57:33Z

ByStephen Miles, Contributor. For decades, a company’s success was largely measured by how many people it employed. The equation, growth equals headcount, defined an entire generation of business leadership from early-stage startups to Fortune 100 Companies. Adding employees was one of the key metrics that captured a company’s growth potential within its industry. The epicenter of this was in the technology sector, where founders and CEOs continuously talked about hyper-scaling through the lens of employee headcount expansion. This metric translated into the “hyper-scaling” narrative, which further translated into eye-watering valuations and market premiums. Headcount growth peaked during COVID, with many companies in the technology sector hiring as fast and furiously as their recruiting functions could handle. Employees in this era assumed significant power and asserted it through a total rejection of returning to the office (RTO), planting a firm flag on working from home indefinitely. Some went further, forming unions to collectively push back against company strategies and policies, including work with the Department of Defense, hybrid work models, and DE&I positions. The Year of Efficiency Post-COVID, we entered a new era highlighted by Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, announcing “the year of efficiency.” This marked a clear pivot away from headcount as a measure of hyper growth and a signal that trimming over-hiring and bloat would be the new mantra. Many founders and CEOs quickly followed, and we have seen a trend of high-performing companies continuing to announce reductions in their workforce, including Amazon, UPS, Target, Microsoft, and others. Historically, downsizing was viewed as a sign of weakness. In this new era, it has become a mark of discipline and strength, which also requires new leadership muscle from those still around. The old mindset held that a company grew its employee base and added spans and layers during prosperous times, only to shed them when conditions worsened. The new mindset is to run the company like an Olympic athlete, lean and efficient even in good times, with the goal of staying in top form year-round rather than letting bureaucracy creep in. The world we operate in has become less predictable, and the velocity of change has surpassed most executives’ wildest predictions. Leading a company that stays “fit” allows leaders to reduce bloat and bureaucracy, increasing the likelihood that the company can move faster and adapt better than its competitors. Entering the AI Era We are now entering the next phase, ushered in by the artificial intelligence revolution. We are still in the first chapter of this new era, and the true future of work and the corporation is yet to be defined. Across industries, leaders are converging on the same mindset. In my thirty years of coaching, this is the first time I have seen every CEO focused on running their company with fewer employees next year and beyond. The first chapter of this era has been less about front-page headlines of massive layoffs and more about stealth. CEOs are freezing headcount and putting real restrictions on hiring, allowing natural churn and attrition to reduce workforce size quietly. Most companies churn between 5 and 15 percent of their employees annually, and when you restrict rehiring, reductions happen without announcements. If you are a knowledge worker, you know what I mean. This is one of the hardest job markets ever for those looking to change roles or get hired. The competition is fierce, and openings are scarce outside of highly specialized roles such as AI. It is harder to get a new job than to get into an elite university, with thousands of applications for a handful of positions. Even the students from the most elite business schools are struggling to enter this job market. The AI Revolution and Its Reach The AI revolution has not even fully hit most companies yet. If you believe this is more like electricity than snake oil, it will transform the operating models and blueprints of every company and every employee. Apart from the internet, it is the only time a new technology truly touches everyone across an organization. Previous technological revolutions affected only small portions of the workforce. The database and cloud computing eras were largely handled by specialists and technology executives. AI, by contrast, reaches everyone, whether you are in a plant, on the front line, driving a truck, or working at corporate headquarters. Naysayers argue that new technologies take decades to fully integrate into the workforce. The difference this time is that everyone who owns a mobile phone (important to note that more phones exist than humans) already has access to AI. Most people have already experimented with ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, often for fun or travel planning. Others have started using AI to increase productivity, eliminating repetitive work and focusing on higher-order problems. These employees are already differentiating themselves and will continue to pull ahead. As they make AI their personal superpower and become truly reflexive in its use, they will get noticed and likely elevated. At the employee level, we will enter a phase of “elevate or be disintermediated.” The future of being an employee is about higher density through elevated work or risk becoming irrelevant. The Risk of AI Slop This is not all doom and gloom. Every employee has the opportunity to make AI their superpower and, instead of being replaced by automation, use it to accelerate their growth. The challenge is that AI is still in its infancy and often confidently wrong. It is a tool to enhance productivity and eliminate low-value effort, not a place to dump your cognitive load and disengage. AI can help every employee become the highest-performing version of themselves, better, faster, and smarter, but it still requires human oversight. We have entered the era of “AI slop,” where employees risk lowering their potential if they treat AI as the answer rather than as an enhancer. The best employees will apply their cognition to higher-order problems, using AI’s speed to amplify their contextual thinking. Context Is the New Differentiator AI will dominate content creation, and its ability to synthesize and organize data is unmatched. Humans, however, are the best at context. The better you are at contextualizing a problem for an AI agent, the better the result you will get. As Tobi Lütke, the founder and CEO of Shopify, said on the ACQ2 podcast, it is not “prompt engineering,” it is “context engineering.” Employees who master context engineering faster will stand out early in this revolution. The way employees work will also change dramatically. For decades, many workers were measured by activity: meetings attended, insights generated, and presentations created. Accountability was cumulative, building through recurring meetings until someone finally made a decision. That model is dying. The premium on activities will decrease, perhaps to zero, as AI agents take on content assembly, allowing fewer, higher-density employees to focus on decisions and actions. What once took many meetings will soon happen in one or two. These high-density meetings will demand full cognitive engagement. Employees will need to re-learn how to have meaningful, high-accountability discussions. As recent CEOs have noted, leaders are pushing back against multitasking and texting in meetings. The future workplace will require attention, presence, and decisive ownership. Making the Case for Humans in an AI World As more routine and repetitive work is automated through AI, human factors will become the premium differentiators: leadership, relationships, trust, judgment, decision making, prioritization, and high-context communication. This comes at a time when years of isolation and remote work have dulled even the strongest interpersonal skills. Companies and employees alike must focus on two elements: making AI reflexive for every employee and strengthening human factors to turn enhanced content and higher-density collaboration into speed and execution. The companies and individuals that master both will define the true age of the Ozempic Company, lean, fast, and built to endure.

Title: Republican warns Trump now 'losing' on economy — and says it's 'going to get a lot worse'

As the government shutdown continues with millions of Americans losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and federal employees going without pay forcing many to turn to food banks, President Donald Trump's focus on foreign policy and building a ballroom is causing supporters and Republicans to question his priorities, according to NBC News. The shutdown, NBC reports, is compounding problems that have intensified "broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies — including Amazon and Target — and an uptick in inflation." Recent polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of the economy, with approval ratings generally falling in the range of 37 percent to 41 percent and disapproval ratings around 57 percent to 62 percent. His economic approval numbers are currently the lowest of his second term in office. Republicans, NBC says, are sounding the alarm about this "bleak" outlook, but are afraid to tell Trump the truth. “No one wants to tell the president he’s losing on the economy,” according to a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns. Despite that, some Republicans are still optimistic. Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) says that despite the numbers and the millions of Americans relying on food banks, "the state of the economy is very strong." NBC notes that many Republicans are intentionally remaining silent about the abysmal state of Trump's economy. "Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump’s economy," they note. Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the fact that Americans are suffering, but blames the Democrats despite Republicans having control of the House, the Senate and the White House. "The unfortunate reality — and we’re starting to see this with our aviation industry — we’re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vance said. Betty Szretter, a Republican and former Trump supporter who now regrets her vote and told NBC she will vote for a Democrat. blames the president. “I think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,” she said. “But now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.” “It all seems very selfish,” she added.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back! Looking for something to watch? We have a new video podcast starring the great Katie Notopoulos and Emily Stewart. "Well Spent" covers how we buy, what we buy, and why we buy. Their first episode examines a doozy of a purchase: a home. Check it out here. In today's big story, people are getting nervous about layoffs. It could be time to start planning ahead. What's on deck: Markets: Looking to invest in the AI data-center boom? There's an ETF for that. Tech: How workers train Tesla's Optimus robot to act like a human. Business: Social media is becoming a lucrative new side hustle for some military personnel. But first, hope for the best but plan for the worst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Halloween has come and gone, but the labor market is still feeling spooky. Many workers see job security as a rarity these days. But instead of waiting for the proverbial axe to drop, some are getting ahead of layoffs in a variety of ways, writes BI's Jacob Zinkula. Sometimes it's as simple as getting a jump start on job hunting while you're still employed. Other people Jacob spoke to diversified their income with a side hustle or picked up a second full-time gig. While the approaches differed, the goal was the same: Don't get caught off-guard if cuts come. That's sound advice regardless of the job market, but it certainly holds true these days. The labor market has remained largely frozen for the past few months, with little to no hiring or firing. The slight thawing we have seen in recent weeks has been due to layoffs. There has also been a rise in rolling layoffs where companies make multiple, small cuts as opposed to a single deep one. The approach is meant to help companies avoid cutting too deeply, but it doesn't do much for employee morale. As if all of this wasn't nightmarish enough, don't forget the threat of AI. Companies seem keen to leverage the tech's efficiencies, which many interpret to mean lower headcounts. Some of you might be dismissive of these layoff preppers. "If you worked that hard on you're regular job, you wouldn't have to worry about getting laid off!" But layoffs aren't always telegraphed, and even in their aftermath, the reasoning isn't always clear. Take Amazon's recent job cuts. When the news was first announced, it was described as part of the company's goal to be leaner in the age of AI. One Amazon executive even encouraged employees in an internal memo to "lean in on AI." But just a few days later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs weren't AI-driven — "not right now at least," he added — and were instead about culture. So yes, maybe it doesn't hurt to be a bit proactive. And if you do end up getting bitten by the layoff bug, we've got you covered with what to do next. 1. This ETF could body the AI-data-center boom. The Tema Electrification ETF (VOLT) is poised to win big from the AI spending spree, according to analysts at Ned Davis Research. It's already beating the S&P 500, and analysts think it'll outperform the index by roughly 20% by 2027. 2. Leaving Wall Street for AI. When former Balyasny portfolio manager Barry Duong was under his noncompete period, he decided to learn about AI. Now, Duong leads AI strategy at startup Hebbia and thinks other Wall Streeters should also consider making the move. 3. How an "accidental banker" is running one of Wall Street's biggest deal machines. Houlihan Lokey CEO Scott Adelson told BI how the bank is positioning itself, from going on a hiring spree while rivals hold back to making targeted acquisitions. 1. What it's like to train Tesla's humanoid robot to be… human. Inside a glass-walled lab, dozens of Tesla workers act out the basic motions of everyday life — from wiping a table to lifting a cup — in an effort to train Optimus to move like a human. In conversations with BI, five current and former employees revealed what the job requires, including twerking, sprinting, and acting like a gorilla. One worker said that if their movements aren't deemed "human enough," their performance is critiqued. 2. AI, but make it have feelings. Eric Zelikman, a top AI researcher who recently left xAI, is raising $1 billion for his new startup at a $4 billion valuation, according to sources. Humans& will build models that attempt to learn from and empathize with their users. 3. Amazon's rollercoaster week. On Tuesday, mass layoffs shook the Big Tech company. By Thursday, Wall Street was cheering a strong Q3 earnings report. Behind all of this, CEO Andy Jassy has been focused on changing the company's culture and proving its AI chops, BI's Eugene Kim writes. 1. One of the biggest competitions in San Francisco is shockingly low-tech. Getting your ad on billboards (yes, billboards) has become an "insane competition." It's largely thanks to AI startups with cash to burn that are looking to stand out. In some areas, billboard space is sold out for the next year. 2. A soldier's foray into social media stardom. Since becoming a social media star, Sgt. 1st Class Johnny Vargas said he now earns more money online than through the Army. For BI's series on military influencer culture, Vargas said he's on a mission to help other service members cash in, too. 3. The C-suite's best career advice. The truth is that there isn't a clear path when it comes to climbing to the top. It's often dependent on timing, the industry, personal networks, and more. Executives shared with BI the best career advice that's stuck with them. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Why corporate executives shouldn’t ignore their own AI upskilling

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily. Good morning. Artificial intelligence is redefining the workplace, and corporate jobs aren’t excluded from its reach. During a panel session at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh last week, Anne Lim O’Brien, vice chair and partner at Heidrick & Struggles, said, “Professional services—lawyers, accountants, management consultants like myself—the ones who actually process, analyze, and deal with a lot of data, those are the skills that can be replaced by AI and agentic AI.” Hisham Radwan, CEO of Cigna Insurance Saudi Arabia and a fellow panelist, added actuaries to that growing list. “AI is moving so fast that we can’t control it,” Radwan said. “But bottom line—it’s an enhancement to our capabilities rather than a replacement.” As companies shift from the hype phase to the adoption phase of AI, they’re seeing productivity gains, O’Brien said. But she noted that companies must address a critical question: What are they doing with the time AI saves? For leaders, the promise of AI goes far beyond efficiency—it should free time for strategic thinking and innovation, she said. It’s also an opportunity to double down on skills like emotional intelligence, which is widely considered one of the core human abilities that AI cannot truly replace, she added. Tech giant Amazon’s approach is shaking up the corporate landscape. The company announced last week that it will cut roughly 14,000 corporate jobs—about 4% of its white-collar workforce, mostly middle managers—as part of a restructuring aimed at “reducing bureaucracy” and “removing organizational layers.” The company is offering “most employees” 90 days to look for a new role internally. For those who can’t find a new role or choose not to look for one, Amazon will provide severance pay, outplacement services, and health insurance benefits, among other measures, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience, wrote in the announcement to employees. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy said last year that he wants the company to operate like “the world’s largest startup” and to have the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership. During the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Jassy said the layoffs were about a cultural mismatch, not primarily financial, Fortune reported. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven—not right now, at least,” Jassy said of the job cuts. “It’s culture.” However, Amazon’s job cuts follow a company-wide email in June, in which Jassy wrote that those who embrace generative AI and help build Amazon’s capabilities will have the most impact and assist in reinventing the company. Fortune’s Eva Roytburg highlights that Galetti mentioned in the company memo that this generation of AI is a “transformative technology” and that the company needs to be organized more leanly—with fewer layers and more ownership—to move as quickly as possible. “The move may offer an early glimpse of how AI is actually reshaping the labor force: not by immediately displacing the tactile, mundane factory roles everyone expected, but by hollowing out the white-collar ranks that run them,” Roytburg writes. Gartner analysts estimate that by 2026, one in five organizations could use AI to estimate at least half of their management layers. AI may not necessarily take your job—but someone who knows how to use AI better than you might, O’Brien warned during the panel session in Riyadh. The takeaway: upskilling and reskilling aren’t just for those in non-corporate positions—they’re essential at every level of the organization. What’s helping you keep your AI skills sharp?

(NYSE: CRBG), has resigned to accept a senior leadership position with a publicly listed company. Habayeb will remain in his current position until April 24, 2026. Habayeb’s departure is not the result of any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to its financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, operations, policies or practices. Corebridge is working with an executive recruiting firm to launch a search for a successor. Cassandra Hudson was appointed CFO of Alkami Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALKT), a digital sales and service platform provider, effective November 1. Hudson brings more than 20 years of experience. Most recently, she served as CFO of StackAdapt. Before that, she was CFO of EngageSmart, where she guided the company through a successful IPO in 2021. Earlier in her career, Hudson spent 12 years at Carbonite in a series of finance leadership roles, ultimately serving as chief accounting officer and VP of finance. Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) Global M&A Report 2025 shows global deal value rose 10% to $1.9 trillion through Q3, driven by North America, which accounted for 62% of deals ($1.3 trillion, up 26% year over year). Seasoned acquirers—using proven playbooks and increasingly, AI—achieved a two-year average return of +1.0%, while less experienced buyers saw –7.5%. Despite challenges like geopolitical tensions and shifting tariffs, many dealmakers continue to move forward, particularly in small- and mid-cap markets, where regional transactions have been more insulated from disruptions, according to BCG. Strategic growth, capability building, and resilience remain key drivers. North America is the top region by value, and technology leads among industries. Leading firms now embed AI throughout diligence, valuation, and integration, accelerating decision-making and risk management. Megadeals are rebounding, with 27 transactions over $10 billion this year (up from 21 last year). Sector standouts include industrials (+77%), tech (+10%), energy (+20%), and health care (+20%).

Title: Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks The fingerprints of artificial intelligence are all over mass layoffs and downsizing at Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, YouTube and other major companies, raising fears of an AI-fueled jobs wipeout for white-collar workers. AI may hurt demand for office workers, but there’s reason for hope, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes. The dynamic American workforce will evolve, as it has in the past, Solomon told CNN during a sit-down interview. Solomon, speaking from the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, cited the disruption caused by the invention in the late 1700s of the steam engine, which helped fuel the first industrial revolution. “There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.” Of course, that adjustment process can be difficult – especially for the workers whose careers have been sidelined by new technology. A key difference this time is the explosive speed at which AI is being embraced by businesses – and how rapidly AI itself is advancing. A Goldman Sachs survey of bankers found that 37% of clients are using AI for regular production, with adoption expected to hit 50% next year and 74% in the next three years. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and now boasts 800 million weekly active users. Its parent company OpenAI is reportedly laying the groundwork for an IPO that could value it at up to $1 trillion. Today’s AI chatbots can do deep research, generate stunningly realistic films, compose music and instantly flag financial fraud before it can even get completed. That speed could make the transition bumpier this time around. “The pace of adoption of this technology is going a little bit faster. As businesses wrestle with deploying the technology and the automation, the short-term disruption might be a little bit higher,” the Goldman Sachs CEO said. “But our economy is incredibly broad and nimble.” Office workers may be especially exposed to that disruption. Although Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company’s recent 14,000 layoffs were “not even really AI driven,” he said in June that adopting generative AI and AI agents will shrink the company’s corporate workforce. Meta recently cut 600 roles within its AI team, which reports have indicated is part of an effort to move more nimbly. YouTube this week began offering voluntary buyouts to US employees as part of an AI-focused restructuring. Workers at Chegg, an online education company, are being hurt by AI on two fronts. First, the rise of ChatGPT is lowering demand for Chegg’s education services. Secondly, Chegg itself is investing in AI, promising to run its business leaner with fewer workers to compete. This week Chegg said it will slash nearly half its workforce as it grapples with the “new realities of AI” and lower search traffic. AI was cited as a reason for 17,375 layoff announcements this year tracked by outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas through the end of September. That represents less than 2% of the total layoffs announced this year. However, Challenger noted that this tally likely undershoots AI-linked layoffs. Another 20,219 job cuts announced during that period were tied to companies citing unspecified technological updates – some of which could be related to AI. “The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they’ll be picked up in other parts of the economy,” said Solomon. By contrast, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of entry-level jobs in white-collar professions, lifting the unemployment rate to up to 20% in the near future. “It’s eerie the extent to which the broader public and politicians, legislators, I don’t think, are fully aware of what’s going on,” Amodei told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in May. “We have to act now. We can’t just sleepwalk into it.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during a press conference that a “significant number of companies” are either doing layoffs or saying they won’t hire much in part because of AI. “We’re watching that very carefully…It could absolutely have implications for job creation,” Powell said. A survey of over 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers finds that just 11% of US companies are “actively reducing headcount due to AI,” a report published last week said. However, that figure rises to 31% for tech, media and telecom companies. Goldman Sachs bankers expect AI will lead to “modest headcount reductions” of 4% over the next year. But that number could rise to 11% over the next three years – especially in customer service jobs. Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote that the findings support the bank’s view that AI will have a “transformative impact on the labor market and economy,” and that rapid adoption signals that “AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected.” The AI boom has also raised worries about a bubble forming in this red-hot part of the market. Solomon said that while many “great companies” will be formed during the AI boom, at some point the exuberance could get overdone and it won’t be a “straight line up” in value. One scenario he laid out is that demand for AI services may at some point fail to reach lofty expectations, driving valuations down. But that process could take time to play out because, as Solomon noted, most public tech companies are well-established and the newer AI companies are largely still in private markets, where valuation markdowns only change slowly. “The technology is exciting – there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.” – CNN’s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.

Title: I'm a recruiting manager in tech. Here's what I'd do right now if I were worried about being laid off.

Every time Bonnie publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here's the reality in 2025: you can lose your job with no warning. I've worked in tech for the past four years, and during that time, I've witnessed thousands of layoffs and reorganizations. I have friends who have been laid off two to three times in a single year. One day, you're happily employed, the next, you can't log into Slack, your key card no longer works, and you open your personal email to see an email from HR informing you that you're no longer employed. This week, Amazon announced that it will lay off up to 30,000 employees this year, and 14,000 have been let go already. Whether you were affected by the layoffs at Amazon or you feel your job at another company could be at risk, there are things you can do if you suspect layoffs could be coming your way. My recommendation is that you make this a standard practice every month or two. A year from now, it may be hard to remember who that colleague was who told you that you were the best project manager they ever worked with. Keep track of those networks now. Record the names and contact info of colleagues you've worked with, along with a few notes on how you worked together. Connect on LinkedIn as well. Should you be laid off, you now have people you can reach out to for references or introductions to opportunities within their networks. Screenshot a shoutout from an executive and download performance reviews. You can use this to help you think through examples for interviews, and it can even serve as motivation and a reminder of your impact. You'll want these data points for your résumé and interviews, and saving them along the way will make it much easier than having to hunt them down once you've left your workplace. Some job applications require you to share a portfolio or samples of your work. You could also be asked to do some sort of project as part of the interview process. Save this info now rather than scrambling to have people send it to you after a layoff. Many of us use our work emails for work-related accounts, such as LinkedIn. Make sure you add a personal email address as well — this will be helpful for accessing these accounts should you be laid off. Otherwise, you could be locked out. You can always update these after a layoff, but if you make a habit of updating them regularly, it will be far easier to kick off your job search than if this becomes another task that you have to take on during a time of stress. If you have already been laid off, give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. Layoffs are traumatic, and you will need time to recover before starting your job search. Aside from looking for a new role, there are a few things you should add to your to-do list. This can take weeks to kick in, so prioritize this as one of your first steps. Make sure you understand the details of your severance package. There may be requirements to receive your full package, or it may be more beneficial to negotiate some portions. Many service providers have programs for those who are unemployed — you may be able to get a forbearance on student loans, a pause on car loans or your mortgage, or some relief on your interest rates for a credit card. You never know if you don't ask. Consider what expenses you can eliminate. Unemployment will not replace your full salary, so cutting back on subscriptions, streaming services, etc., might help your money go further. Write a post on LinkedIn to share your update with your professional network, and also ensure that your friends and extended community are aware. Most people probably don't know what you do, but if you share a bit about job titles and industries that are a good match and let them know you're seeking referrals, they may be able to help as well. Many find that a job search can take more than six months in 2025, so the more you're able to prepare yourself, the better your chances are of navigating that period successfully. Jump to

Title: With Trump's focus elsewhere, the economy shows signs of trouble

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time For Hannah Szretter, the government shutdown is more than just a political fight. The 26-year-old Buffalo-area resident said she has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 10 and also now has a mental health disorder that prevents her from working. The $300 she receives each month in food assistance from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been a needed lifeline to make sure she is able to maintain her blood sugar level. “I need these benefits for my food. If I don’t get the food, I won’t be able to control my numbers,” she told NBC News. “If you don’t get it taken care of, you can lose toes or limbs, or could go blind.” Now she is among the more than 40 million people who may not receive their November SNAP benefits as the government shutdown goes into its sixth week with no end in sight. “It’s scary,” she said. Trump's attention, however, was elsewhere, this weekend. Just hours before these food assistance benefits were set to lapse, President Donald Trump hosted a lavish "Great Gatsby"-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago, with the theme: "A little party never killed nobody." And on Friday, he posted dozens of photos on social media about his fancy renovation of the Lincoln bathroom in the White House. Along with the loss of SNAP benefits and the disruption of other social service programs for millions of people, the government shutdown has resulted in federal employees going without pay. Many of them have turned to food banks and unemployment benefits to get by. Hannah’s mom, Betty, a 63-year-old recent retiree who is a caretaker for her daughter and a longtime Trump supporter, said she is losing confidence in the president she once supported amid the shutdown fight. “I think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,” she said. “But now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.” “It all seems very selfish,” she added. Betty Szretter said she now regrets voting for Trump in 2024 and would prefer a Democrat in the White House to “protect benefits he [Trump] wants to cut.” The shutdown is compounding problems that have intensified broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies — including Amazon and Target — and an uptick in inflation. That stagnation has in recent months eroded the high approval marks President Donald Trump once enjoyed on the economy. The bleak picture has some Republicans sounding the alarm to the White House — even though delivering the news isn’t easy. “No one wants to tell the president he’s losing on the economy,” said a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns. Trump’s overall approval rating sits at 43%, while just 34% of registered voters say he has “lived up” to expectations on the economy, 33% say he has “looked out for the middle class” and 30% say he met expectations on inflation, according to a new NBC News poll released Sunday. A White House official blamed Democrats for the prolonged shutdown and argued that some indicators, like growing wages and a booming stock market, are proof the economy has bright spots. The person also argued that the massive tax cuts and tariffs pursued by Trump are going to take time to fully take effect. “I don’t think anyone is under any illusions that things are perfect … but looking at the data, we feel good about the trajectory here,” said the White House official, who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “The bottom line is that the actual buying power and actual purchasing power of American consumers is going up, and, as far as specific prices go, you know there are things like gas and eggs that have gone down,” the official said. They also asserted that Trump’s pursuit of investment in the U.S. will pay major dividends in the future for American workers and consumers. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and Trump ally, said in an interview with NBC News that he remains optimistic about the economy. “The state of the economy is very strong, if you look at real wages that continue to go up,” Moreno said. “The Working Families Tax Cut Act worked really well. ... The big thing is, obviously, the Democrats don’t want the economy to be successful, which is decently sad considering they should be cheering for the American people. But they shut down the government because they want Trump to fail.” Republicans are pushing for the passage of a “continuing resolution,” which would extend current funding levels until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, want to include an extension of tax credits that help people buy private insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Those credits expire at the end of the year, and without the extension, millions of people who receive them are likely to see steep premium increases. Republicans have argued the health care fight should be handled separately, after the government reopens. For his part, Trump for weeks has largely been focused on issues aside from the shutdown and economic concerns, with the exception of deals around his tariffs. Democrats have called on him to become more engaged to help end the stalemate. On Tuesday night, Trump did write on social media that Senate Republicans should use the “nuclear option” to get rid of the filibuster. The drastic move would allow Republicans to reopen the government without needing 60 votes — and the cooperation of Democrats — but it was swiftly rejected by Republican leaders. Last week, Trump’s attention was in Asia, far from the pain of the shutdown, with a big announcement on tariffs. Before that, much of his focus was on demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors, a project that is ongoing. And on Thursday, a reporter asked Vice President JD Vance about the loss of SNAP benefits, and whether the administration was working to find a funding solution, as it has tried to do to pay troops and law enforcement during the shutdown. Vance avoided answering whether there would be a push around SNAP, instead blaming Democrats. “The unfortunate reality — and we’re starting to see this with our aviation industry — we’re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vance said. Some relief could be coming — but if it does, it’s over the Trump administration’s objections. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the administration to distribute money to SNAP recipients “as soon as possible” by tapping a contingency fund. Another federal judge in a separate case also said it was unlawful for the administration not to pay out the benefits. The White House has argued that it cannot use those funds and is seeking further clarification from the courts. Several recent public polls have pointed to Trump having an economic problem, one that is quickly turning into a political one for Republicans trying to maintain slim majorities in the House and Senate headed into the 2026 midterms — an election where Republicans will have to energize Trump voters without his presence on the ballot. The new NBC News poll found Republicans have just a 1-point advantage over Democrats on “dealing with the economy,” a margin that has consistently been 15-20 points in favor of Republicans going back to 2018. Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego’s winning campaign in Arizona last year, said that economic hardship gives his party’s candidates an opening to win key segments of the electorate — including the young men who helped Trump take back the White House — if they focus on making the argument that their policies are better than the president’s. “Right now, people’s prices are going up. Their prices are going up for the utility bills, going up for lots of things in their life, because of the tariffs,” Rocha said. “If you show up and start talking to folks about actually trying to provide for their family, there’s going to be a lot of men who right now feel a little regret because they were promised lower prices and they’re not getting them.” Moreno said he was not worried “about the politics” of the shutdown, noting that he has pledged to serve no more than two Senate terms and, as a native of Colombia, is constitutionally ineligible to be president. But he said Republicans need to better articulate their message: that they hold Democrats responsible for the shutdown and its economic ramifications. He specifically alluded to recent remarks from House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who in an interview with Fox News acknowledged that families would “suffer” because of the shutdown but emphasized that Democrats needed to exert their political “leverage” to address health care costs. “We’ve got to speak up more loudly and more aggressively, like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune did the other day. I think we haven’t shown enough outrage. We do it privately, but we haven’t done it enough publicly. Just call these guys out. It’s disgusting,” Moreno said. “We need to speak clearly, with humanity, not political talk,” he added. Trump remains popular with Republicans on things like immigration enforcement — Betty Szretter says she still supports the president on that issue — but pocketbook issues more often than not have an outsize role in swaying election outcomes. The NBC News poll found 83% of registered voters said the “cost of living” was their single most important issue or very important to them, a number that was at 58% when they were asked about “immigration and border security.” On the Asia trip last week, Trump nevertheless told reporters he had the “highest [poll] numbers I ever had.” He has also directly avoided questions about the economy. “Let’s just make it about this subject,” Trump said at an event centered around an autism announcement last month. “I’d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.” Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump’s economy. NBC News reached out to eight Republicans either defending swing seats they currently hold or challenging Democrats in winnable seats; seven did not return requests seeking comment. Brinker Harding is a Republican city councilman in Omaha running to replace Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is not seeking re-election in one of the most up-for-grab seats in the country. Harding said he believes that once the midterm campaigns really begin, moves Trump has made will have the economy in a better place. “Come next November, Republicans’ tax cuts for working families and small businesses, in addition to projected interest rate cuts, will have the American economy moving more than it already is,” he said. Other swing state Republicans where vulnerable Democrats are on the ballot are pinning economic woes on those Democrats. “Maine’s issues are especially pronounced on the economic front,” said Lauren LePage, who is the Republican national committeewoman from Maine. “And the blame for our high cost of living, nation-leading electricity price increases and more lies at the feet of Democrats here.” Maine is home to one of the nation’s most closely watched 2026 Senate contests as Democrats try to knock off Republican Sen. Susan Collins. LePage’s father, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, is himself running to challenge Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, in a House seat that is considered winnable for either party. Other Republicans, including some former Trump allies, are acknowledging that prices have remained stubbornly high during Trump’s second term in office. “Prices have not come down at all,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on “The Tim Dillon Show” last week. “The job market is extremely difficult. Wages have not gone up.” She has also made an uncharacteristic pivot in recent weeks. After being one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, she has been critical of the president and her own party of late, agreeing with Democrats that the Affordable Care Act tax credits should be included as part of any deal to reopen the government. “When it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums, I think that’s unforgivable,” she told NBC News in early October. For people like Betty Szretter, they just want the fight to be over and the focus to return to Americans hurting in the current economic climate. “I would say practice what you preach and save the country as a true servant,” she said when asked what she would say to Trump directly. “There are not a lot of people who use their wealth to actually help others. Really no one.” Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida. Jonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News. Henry J.

Title: Changing the AI narrative from liberation to acceleration
URL: https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/ai-narrative-from-liberation-to-acceleration
Time Published: 2025-11-03T08:00:00Z

by Tom Johnson on Nov 3, 2025 categories: ai The most frequent story told about AI is that it will free us up from mundane tasks and allow us to focus on more impactful, strategic work. But the liberation part of that story might be misleading. In this post, I argue that AI's true effect is to accelerate the entire competitive landscape, increasing the pace of work for everyone. In this new, sped-up world, companies that replace human workers with AI for short-term gains, assuming that the pace of change is static, may find themselves falling behind in the long term. Introduction The AI narrative Hard limits to velocity Increasing speed means risking more error A world sped up A new AI narrative Introduction There’s a pretty depressing post on the techwriting subreddit right now: AWS tech writers majorly impacted by today’s layoffs … with nearly 968 likes and 94 comments to date. In the post, one of the former AWS tech writers writes: … it doesn’t matter that AI can’t do everything we do. It doesn’t matter that the quality is noticeably worse than our writing. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t know all the overhead and confusing internal systems that we use to get our docs out the door. Corporate leadership doesn’t care about any of those things. They will give you AI tools, train “you” to use them (it’s really the other way around - you’re training it), tell you that it’ll make your life easier, and still let you go in the end. It’s a sobering thread that has many in the industry upset, and understandably so. The post prompted me to think about the larger AI narrative that often gets told, and how that narrative might be misleading. The current AI story is only partly true, and damaging in the way it can mislead. Laying off employees in response to AI could be a short-sighted strategy based on a static pace fallacy, which is the assumption that the amount of work is fixed. In reality, AI accelerates the entire competitive landscape, increasing the overall pace of work. Moreover, AI shifts the bottleneck from content generation to human validation. Companies will need their human workers, augmented by AI, to manage this new, higher-volume validation bottleneck and keep from falling behind. The AI narrative The AI narrative, if there is a general one, goes something like this: AI is going to make you so productive, you can do 3x as much and free up time for more strategic, important tasks that AI can’t do. I frequently hear professionals noting how AI allowed them to do tasks that might normally take a long afternoon of tedious work. CEOs probably hear this and think AI will allow us to do the same with one third the number of employees. As a result, you’ve seen the flat hiring and the increased pace at which tech writers are working. However, this thinking (reducing employees because AI can do their work) commits the static pace fallacy — the assumption that the total volume of work and competitive expectations are fixed, rather than dynamic and accelerating. Here’s what most people overlook in the AI liberation narrative: If AI speeds up your productivity, it speeds up the productivity of everyone around you too. And every company in your domain. And companies abroad. So those other companies will also deliver faster, with higher quality, and more prolifically if they’re also using AI. Here’s an analogy for this argument. Consider the computer’s effect on writing. Let’s say you, a tech writer working in 1990, get a computer, learn to type, and realize that you can write a lot faster and easier using this tool. It even doubles your productivity versus writing by longhand with a pen. It’s amazing. For the first few months, your productivity soars because not many other writers have computers, and it’s become your secret weapon. Whereas with pen and paper you might have written 1 document a week, with a computer you now produce 3 documents a week. However, within the year all the other writers have computers too and are using them to match the same increased levels of productivity. Pretty soon everyone else is also producing 3 documents a week. Now AI comes along and wow, it’s another leap in speeding up technical documentation. As an early adopter you figure out the tools, the prompting techniques, and how to integrate AI into your workflows. You’re no longer producing 3 documents a week — you’re creating 5 documents a week. For the first few months, you’re ahead of everyone else because some writers are slow to learn new tools and processes. But before long, the other writers also figure out AI, get access to the complex reasoning models, and learn how to integrate them into their workflows. Everyone is now generating 5 documents a week. Now consider that AI is speeding up the roles of everyone around you too — developers, product managers, lawyers, customer support, partner engineers. Everyone has ratcheted up their productivity a couple of notches. Because speed is relative, any early advantage you might have had in using AI to produce more documentation is negated as the entire system accelerates. The number of requests simply increases to fill the new capacity. The net result is that although your productivity is 5x as much, your workload is 5x greater too. Whereas before you supported 1 software team pushing out a major release quarterly, now you support 3 software teams pushing out major releases monthly. Now come back to this idea that AI tools will liberate you from tedious work and free you up to focus on more impactful, strategic work. That “free time” never unfolds like you think it does because the workload just increases all around. I might not be spending 3 hours formatting entries in an HTML table and troubleshooting rendering errors. But I’m also not seeing my bug queue slim down and my bandwidth open up to tackle more strategic issues. I simply have 3x as many doc tickets coming in. The net result of AI is to speed everything up. This increased speed is that breathless feeling almost everyone has experienced lately. Hardly a week goes by that you’re not inundated with announcements about new AI tools, integrations, techniques, events, training, and more. This has led to AI fatigue. It’s exhausting. The most recent figure to promote the idea of acceleration is Ray Kurzweil and his idea of the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), as he argues in The Singularity Is Nearer. His argument is that technology’s pace increases, in part, because it’s generating a feedback loop of tools that allow for increased development. AI gives rise to more builder tools: it’s a tool that builds other tools, which allows you to create more and more products easier and faster. Think about the invention of the engine, or electricity, or the internet — these innovations enable new capabilities/inventions across domains. Kurzweil says the Internet, an invention with feedback loops to expand more technology and new businesses, doubled labor productivity for a decade. If the Internet gave rise to new industries, professions, companies, economies, etc., imagine what AI will give rise to. Will AI double or quadruple labor productivity? If so, won’t that accelerate the pace of innovation in the corporate landscape? The time between major inventions is undeniably shrinking. Simply go to Timeline of historic inventions and scroll down; notice the timelines shrinking between major inventions. For more recent inventions, see List of emerging technologies. Kevin Kelly also makes the acceleration argument beautifully in What Technology Wants, noting how 100 years ago, the number of items in your house was considerably less than now. Technology innovation has led to abundance. While a precise metric for innovation (for example, a way to quantify the pace as a number) is difficult to capture, the trend is clear: 2,000 years ago, there might have been 1 major invention every 50 years. Today, significant inventions seem to appear every 1 year or sooner. The timespan just keeps shrinking. If the pace is accelerating, companies need all the resources they have just to keep up. By replacing human workers with AI, they risk losing the speed needed to run at the faster clip that others are moving at. For example, let’s say that pushing out one major feature a month per software team was the norm in 2025, but in 2027, the company is expected to push out 3 major features a month just to keep pace with an increased speed across the tech landscape. In 2030, you need to release a major new feature each week in your software product. By 2035, your product will practically need to be perfect and perform miracles to move past competitors in the market. In a state of accelerating change, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better tools, they’ll be eclipsed by those who can. If CEOs operate with a mindset that thinning their employees will yield more profits because they can accomplish the same output with two-thirds the number of people, that commits the fallacy of thinking that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The competitive environment is intensifying. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. How will companies keep up? If a small, nimble company can release a disruptive innovation overnight, they can quickly eclipse the incumbent companies. Maybe in the short term, a company like Amazon can lay off large numbers of tech workers and it won’t matter for a while. But think 3-5 years down the line. Will the same company have the tech resources to keep their competitive edge in a landscape that is accelerating with faster releases, speeding up their development cycles to release new features and products more frequently? If the race is getting faster, a company that chooses to reduce the power of its engine will slow down. Hard limits to velocity A counterargument might be that an existing tech writer’s output will grow commensurately with technological innovation. For example, in 3-5 years, the same tech writer who was producing 5 documents a week will produce 10. That might be partly true. However, the idea that a reduced body of employees will commensurately keep pace with accelerating industry change seems unlikely. This is because there are some hard limits to speed that happen even when you apply AI as much as possible. AI’s speed is mostly with content generation, not content validation. As a result, you end up with a lot of generated content, but the validation processes (the human in the loop to review and check the AI output for errors) aren’t moving at the same speed. This is something I’m wrestling with in the bug zero series that I’ve been writing about. Theoretically, AI should allow me to reduce my doc issues from 40 tickets to 0 tickets. However, I’m not seeing how to use AI in a way that would allow me to achieve that level of speed. I want to, for sure. Often when I turn around someone’s large doc request in record speed, they give me a peer bonus. I feel like a laggard when their requests sit for weeks or months in my queue. Why can’t I speed up my documentation writing velocity to clear out the doc queue? Two reasons. First, because the requests are coming in at a faster clip (tech is accelerating). And second, because although AI speeds up content generation, it doesn’t speed up the validation process — the review and verification, along with issue tracking and work management. Even the simplest task, like fixing a broken link, demonstrates this acceleration ceiling. While AI might help identify or fix the link itself (perhaps it’s a tricky Javadoc package reference), that single step is a fraction of the total work, which includes the following: Create a bug in our ticketing system. Identify the source file containing the error. Make the updates to the content. Create a changelist with the updated file. Identify the SME reviewer who has ownership of the directory. Describe the update in the changelist. Stage the changelist and provide a preview link. Ping the SME to review the changelist. Address any comments from the SMEs. Pass any presubmit tests for the changelist. Wait for the SME to approve the changelist. Submit the changelist. Verify that the changelist correctly propagated into production. Describe the update in release notes. Relay the update in internal reports. Maybe a smarter AI system could automate all these steps. In fact, I plan to try to tackle each one and see how it might be automated. But such automation is difficult. For example, automated reminder messages sent to SMEs are likely to be ignored. Automated changelist descriptions might correctly itemize what’s changed, but without more context the descriptions might fail to communicate the “why” behind the changes. One approach to breaking through the acceleration ceiling is to incorporate smarter error checking tools at key points in the workflow. We already have some in place, and I’ve also introduced my own custom checkpoints. When I submit a changelist, Gemini looks over the file changes to see if the changes match the bug, examines configuration errors or other problems in the changes, and flags any issues to fix. This is usually helpful and more often than not catches issues I miss. I also use my own verification on content by asking Gemini to check the content against the API reference. This usually works well too, though I frequently run up against token constraints due to the size of the APIs, along with needle-in-the-haystack findability problems. Also, it doesn’t make sense to check every CL against the API (such as the link fix CL), so there’s a human judgment call here about which verifications are needed for which content updates. Even with AI assisting the validation process, there are many workflow process steps that can’t be sped up, so each ticket has its own bandwidth constraints regardless of the AI involved in the content generation and verification. This means there’s a ceiling to expected velocity gains. Maybe 7 documents a week is that ceiling. Any attempts to go beyond that speed, such as by reducing the review time or reducing reviewers, means accepting a greater risk of error. Increasing speed means risking more error Going faster means risking more error. It’s like driving a car: If you’re going 20 mph, your risk of collision is low. Go 120 mph, though, and a crash is almost certain. This is where a company starts to incur “productivity debt”: borrowing time by cutting corners on validation, only to pay it back with interest later in the form of rework. Even consider a small doc update that contains an error. When you float this doc update to engineers to review, they won’t approve the changelist due to the error (assuming they catch it). The error can trigger a whole cascade of back-and-forth discussions/interactions on the changelist. You have to look at their comments and interpret them, update your content, resubmit it for review, and so on. Errors slow everything down. It’s even worse if the error slips by reviewers and makes it into production. Now partners might see the errors and communicate them to field engineers, and so on. Every error reduces trust in the documentation and your professional capabilities. So errors aren’t good. Taking time up front to eliminate errors (the validation process that bottlenecks AI’s speedy content generation) actually speeds up the pace of documentation overall. How do you speed up without allowing for greater risk of errors? Let’s assume the pace has really picked up so that each tech writer is publishing not 10 but 100 documents a week. Now you really have less time to diligently review each change. You might only have time to quickly skim incoming changelists to review, hoping that the updates are right. You’d need to trust the AI output more because you don’t have time to test or verify it against a source of truth. You hope that reviewing engineers will do the validation, but they too are sped up. They’re probably relying on the same AI tools to check the content that you already used, creating a dangerous validation loop where no human is actually performing the primary check. A world sped up To recap my argument, yes, AI can accelerate our output, but it won’t liberate us. AI is accelerating everyone’s output. Not just you and your colleagues’ output. It’s accelerating the output from your competition, both nationally and internationally. The world has sped up. In a state of accelerated innovation, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better products, they’ll be eclipsed by companies that can. If CEOs thin their number of employees, thinking it will yield more profits, that short-term thinking commits the fallacy of assuming that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. Expectations about quality are increasing. You have to spend more time in research and development to ensure the competitor’s next release doesn’t put you out of business. This is why company layoffs might be a strategically poor decision: in an attempt to capture short-term profits, they shed the human validation resources needed to compete in the long-term, accelerated race. A new AI narrative Returning to the original idea of this post, what should the AI narrative be? Instead of this liberation narrative: AI does the tedious tasks so you focus on more strategic work. it could be: AI provides tools to speed up your work in a constantly accelerating environment. But no one likes acceleration as a goal here. We’re all accelerating and reeling from its effects. The idea of AI as liberation — liberation from all the tedious and time-consuming tasks you have to do — sounds much more appealing. But that liberation is a false narrative. AI isn’t liberating us. It’s speeding up the race. And we’re out of breath. About Tom Johnson I'm an API technical writer based in the Seattle area.

There’s a pretty depressing post on the techwriting subreddit right now: AWS tech writers majorly impacted by today’s layoffs … with nearly 968 likes and 94 comments to date. In the post, one of the former AWS tech writers writes: … it doesn’t matter that AI can’t do everything we do. It doesn’t matter that the quality is noticeably worse than our writing. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t know all the overhead and confusing internal systems that we use to get our docs out the door. Corporate leadership doesn’t care about any of those things. They will give you AI tools, train “you” to use them (it’s really the other way around - you’re training it), tell you that it’ll make your life easier, and still let you go in the end. It’s a sobering thread that has many in the industry upset, and understandably so. The post prompted me to think about the larger AI narrative that often gets told, and how that narrative might be misleading. The current AI story is only partly true, and damaging in the way it can mislead. Laying off employees in response to AI could be a short-sighted strategy based on a static pace fallacy, which is the assumption that the amount of work is fixed. In reality, AI accelerates the entire competitive landscape, increasing the overall pace of work. Moreover, AI shifts the bottleneck from content generation to human validation. Companies will need their human workers, augmented by AI, to manage this new, higher-volume validation bottleneck and keep from falling behind. The AI narrative, if there is a general one, goes something like this: AI is going to make you so productive, you can do 3x as much and free up time for more strategic, important tasks that AI can’t do. I frequently hear professionals noting how AI allowed them to do tasks that might normally take a long afternoon of tedious work. CEOs probably hear this and think AI will allow us to do the same with one third the number of employees. As a result, you’ve seen the flat hiring and the increased pace at which tech writers are working. However, this thinking (reducing employees because AI can do their work) commits the static pace fallacy — the assumption that the total volume of work and competitive expectations are fixed, rather than dynamic and accelerating. Here’s what most people overlook in the AI liberation narrative: If AI speeds up your productivity, it speeds up the productivity of everyone around you too. And every company in your domain. And companies abroad. So those other companies will also deliver faster, with higher quality, and more prolifically if they’re also using AI. Here’s an analogy for this argument. Consider the computer’s effect on writing. Let’s say you, a tech writer working in 1990, get a computer, learn to type, and realize that you can write a lot faster and easier using this tool. It even doubles your productivity versus writing by longhand with a pen. It’s amazing. For the first few months, your productivity soars because not many other writers have computers, and it’s become your secret weapon. Whereas with pen and paper you might have written 1 document a week, with a computer you now produce 3 documents a week. However, within the year all the other writers have computers too and are using them to match the same increased levels of productivity. Pretty soon everyone else is also producing 3 documents a week. Now AI comes along and wow, it’s another leap in speeding up technical documentation.

Title: Millions of Americans to go back to the polls - sort of
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2025/1103/1541808-us-elections-whelan/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Sean Whelan Washington Correspondent They are at it again. It is election time in the US, so tomorrow - barely a year since Donald Trump won the presidency and Congress (just about), it is back to the voting booths for millions of Americans. Most will be voting in local elections, but there are four electoral contests that have national significance - two statewide polls that test to some extent the popularity of the president's agenda and performance, one referendum that could alter the arithmetic in Congress in next year's midterm elections, and one local election contest that tells us something about the current state of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has been stumbling, shellshocked and aimless, through the charred rubble of its own post-electoral hellscape and all four elections will tell us about the current state of the party. The Democrats badly need some winners, and are spending big in search of morale boosting victories. They are helped by history, with electoral records showing that the party of the president tends to lose these odd-year elections more than win them and in Donald Trump they have a president who is, shall we say, motivating? The governor's races are being held in New Jersey and Virginia with the state legislatures - House and Senate - also up for election. So it is a full on general election at state level in two prosperous north eastern states, where the Trump factor is playing a role in what is quite tight electoral arithmetic. So what it tells us about Americans' real feelings about the first year of the Trump administration is significant - because it is an actual poll not an opinion poll. But then again it is only two states, so lots of caveats apply in trying to stretch interpretations to fit a national picture. Still, they are important national political barometers, falling as they do half-way between the presidential election and the midterms - they are sort of the "midterms of the midterms". The polling information suggests the Democrats will win both governorships, and should retain control of the State House in Trenton, New Jersey's unloved capital. (On a visit to the state house some years ago I asked a staffer where was a good place to get lunch. "Pennsylvania", he replied, nodding in the direction of the river that marked the state lines). Though the Democrats' lead in the polls is not as solid as it should be in such a blue state, so the political nerds will be watching this one closest of all tomorrow’s electoral contests. The 100-seat Virginia House is also a tight affair, with the Republicans needing just three gains to take back control. However, the current government shutdown may tip sentiment against them as northern Virginia is home to the greatest concentration of federal government employees, who are either furloughed, fired or working without pay. Either way, that is a lot of unhappy voters (and a possible reason for the federal budget standoff not to be resolved before the votes are in the boxes). In both states, the Democrats have plumped for the centre ground as their battleground, the party primaries picking candidates with broad appeal to middle America. In both states, the Democrat candidates are women, both with military or intelligence service backgrounds, who got elected to the US Congress in 2018 and made a name for themselves as part of the new centrists in a party that is often defined by the rhetoric of its leftist extremities (especially by its Republican rival). Both Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy officer and helicopter pilot, and Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, stood out as militantly moderate in the last several congresses. Along with another ex-CIA staffer Elissa Slotkin, they were known to some as the "mod squad", in contrast to the better known 'Squad" of left wingers, led by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC), the New York representative. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib back up AOC in forming the furthest left bit of the Democrats in Congress. Neither of the candidates are out to change the world - at least not in the governor’s mansions. They believe that the first rule of politics is winning elections, so both are campaigning on the things that bother ordinary Americans most - the cost of housing, food and medical care as well as the cost of everything else for that matter. The affordability crisis is their best political tailwind. For Ms Spanberger, the president’s tariffs are giving her some traction with some of Virginia’s farmers - soybean farmers in particular stretched on the rack by China in retaliation: last week's apparent deal in Korea could not have come soon enough for them. In the northern - and richest - end of the state, the Federal layoffs help motivate Democratic voters (the Pentagon, CIA headquarters at Langley and the FBI academy at Quantico just three of the vast array of government agencies in the state). The prospect of AI driven layoffs in the state's very large high tech workforce (Google and Amazon both have huge operations, nestled among the prairie-sized data centres that extend south from the Potomac River) may also help. As does the general term "chaos", used by Ms Spanberger and several other speakers at a campaign event we went to last week in Alexandria (not far from George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon). Virginia is the only state of the old Confederacy that Donald Trump did not win in the presidential election last year (the state capital, Richmond, was also the capital of the Confederacy). The outgoing Governor, Glenn Youngkin, a successful financier with the Carlyle Group, benefitted from Joe Biden being the incumbent when his election was held. His Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears is running as the Republican candidate, but is not doing well with attack ads claiming she is too right wing for MAGA. Read the latest US stories Ms Earle-Sears, an immigrant from Jamaica who served in the US Marines, looks and sounds much less establishment than Ms Spanberger. That might be part of her undoing in Virginia, at least this time around. And although the Democrats attack her as MAGA, she has a Trump problem: he thinks she is a "phoney". That is because she said in 2022 that he should not run for president again. He has not backed her in this election as a result. Whatever the result, Virginia will get its first female Governor since 1776. President Trump has backed the New Jersey Republican candidate all the way from the primary that cleared the way for Jack Ciattarelli to go again, having narrowly lost in 2021. The polls indicate another narrow loss is on the cards, as the navy pilot-turned lawyer-turned moderate Democrat politician Mikie Sherrill has a narrow lead. The race has been tight enough considering New Jersey is historically a blue state, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost two to one. However, the president has inadvertently given Ms Sherrill a helping hand in one of his early responses to the government shutdown: promising to hit back against Democrat controlled states he pulled $18 billion in Federal funding from a badly needed new railway tunnel linking New Jersey with New York city. That's just enraged New Jersey commuters, some 200,000 of whom head into the Big Apple to earn their daily bread. As a result of railing against the pulled railway funding, Ms Sherrill hardly has to mention the president and his wider policies at all. The other big campaign issue is, like Ms Spanberger, the cost of living crisis. In particular, the cost of electricity for New Jerseyans, which has skyrocketed since the summer. She is promising to take a page from the president's playbook and declare a state of emergency to stop utility companies jacking up the price as rapidly as consumers (there is a deeper financing issue that defies easy soundbite politics, but that is for after the election). There are also plenty of municipal elections taking place in cities and counties across America. The big cities are the ones that count, and of the top 100 cities in the US, 27 have mayoral elections this year - eight of those jobs have already been filled. However, tomorrow sees 19 races in a list of big cities that pretty much reads like the places that have an NFL franchise in them. But only one of them is getting any attention in America. And internationally. There are many reasons why New York is exceptional, both as a city and as a concentration of media organisations with global reach. However, why should anyone outside of the Tri-State area know who the Mayor of New York city is? Be honest - do you know who the Mayor of Dublin is? Yet the name Zohran Mamdani is known everywhere. This is a testimony to the political marketing skills of the 34-year-old member of the New York State House, who shocked the Democratic Party hierarchy earlier this year when he won the party primary to become the Democratic Party Candidate for mayor. And in this heavily Democrat voting city, winning the primary is as good as winning the election itself. Not that Mr Mamdani is taking anything for granted, running a high energy campaign that has stunned many observers of what is generally regarded as conventional wisdom. The New York mayoral contest is the latest installment in the picaresque political opera that is city hall politics in Gotham. The incumbent Mayor, Eric Adams, was a Democrat until he was charged with taking a bribe from the Turkish government to facilitate planning permission for a new Turkish consulate building. He had to resign from the Democrats, but was pardoned by President Trump. He then stood for re-election as an independent. The Democrats sought a new candidate, which opened the door for the former Governor of New York State, to contest the primary. His father was also the governor, and the perception was he would cruise to the nomination. But time had passed him by - he had to resign as governor back in 2021 because of a string of allegations of inappropriate behaviour from female workers in the governors mansion. He had denied all impropriety and fought back, although acknowledging that standards of behaviour have changed over the decades. Enter Mr Mamdani from stage left. Peddling an unlikely US politics combination of pro-Palestine, far left (by US standards) ideas like free public transport, rent control, a massive public housebuilding drive and low cost childcare - all paid for by taxing the rich, he outflanked Andrew Cuomo and secured the nomination. Mr Cuomo had stood as an independent as well. Mr Trump pressed Eric Adams to drop out of the race (reportedly with offers of a job in the administration - in the meantime the former cop is onside with the Trump law and order agenda). The actual Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, is a no hoper - the red beret wearing founder of the Guardian Angels subway patrol group has been accused by some of using the platform to promote his own talk radio show. Mr Trump would prefer if Mr Sliwa quit the race too to give Mr Cuomo a chance to become the stop the Democratic candidate. But despite financial backing from the billionaire class - including a reputed $8.5 million from former Mayor Mike Bloomberg - Mr Cuomo is struggling to cut through: not a Republican, tarnished as a Democrat, totally out of touch with the grinding daily concerns of young New Yorkers. They want someone - anyone - to do something about the cost of living in the city. Never a cheap place, prices for housing in particular are stratospheric. Affordable, available housing is the cry of young people and the modestly paid in cities all over the Western world. Especially in those successful big cities that suck in young talent from all over the globe. Their daily struggles contrast with the almost unbelievable wealth of the mega-rich in Manhattan, and their well-heeled servants on Wall Street. So Mr Mamdani - a proudly proclaimed "democratic socialist", is on track to be the mayor of the world’s most capitalist city. A Muslim, he is outspoken on Palestine and in his criticism of Israel and is winning in the city with the most Jews in the world other than Tel Aviv. As French philosopher and public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy wrote of the apparent success of someone who does not give wholehearted support to the state of Israel in the Wall Street Journal at the weekend : "If New York falls, the entire free world may again totter on its foundations." Which may explain why there is so much attention on this particular mayor's race. What does it tell us about the Democratic Party? Is the Mamdani way the new way for the Democrats to win? Probably not. What works in New York will not work in New Mexico but it could further bolster the far left as a faction in the party. Success for Mr Mamdani could encourage AOC to have a go at current Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who faces a primary vote ahead of next year's midterms, when his seat is up for election again. If 36-year-old AOC replaced the 74-year-old, it would position her to be the leading left wing voice in the Senate, leaving 83-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders free to contemplate slowing down a bit (Mr Sanders is the only politician apart from the president who can pretty well expect to fill stadium-sized speaking engagements around the country: he has been on a nationwide speaking tour with AOC). Mr Trump of course is playing his part, calling Mr Mamdani a communist, and threatening to cut off federal money to the city. Mr Cuomo isn’t throwing in the towel just yet either, placing hope in older voters coming out to vote and younger voters doing anything except voting. So the Democrats could come out of the election looking like they have over the past few years - split. The likely victories for moderates in the governor elections balance the likely victory of Mr Mamdani in the mayor's race. Winning, but not setting a decisive course for the party in the years ahead: the Democratic Party brand is still up for grabs. Of course in real politics, governors are way more important than mayors - they even have their own armies in the form of the National Guard. Mr Mamdani only has the NYPD - a force he has a tetchy relationship with and being seen as soft on crime is a serious impediment for many Democratic Party politicians around the country. And while neither Virginia nor New Jersey could be described a national bellwethers - places that mimic the characteristics of the typical American community - their farmland and endless suburbs are a lot more representative than New York City, a place which is quintessentially urban and mentally closer to European style social democracy than anywhere else in America. It is absolutely atypical. So beware the Mr Mamdani hype when it comes to prognostications about the future of the Democratic party. The biggest lesson for the party establishment is not a new one either: beware of the primary elections - the ones where only the hard core party activists come out to vote (the same is true on the Republican side, hence the MAGA capture of that party). As for the fourth electoral test, this is a referendum in California to authorise a Gerrymander to give the Democrats more seats in next year's midterm elections to the US House of Representatives. The referendum on Proposition 50, to be correct about it, was called by Democratic Party Governor Gavin Newsom. He wants to do a Gerrymander in this already heavily Democrat voting state to bring about the near obliteration of the Republican Party representation in the lower house of Congress. Why? Because Texas Governor Greg Abbott is doing a Gerrymander in Texas to slash the number of Democrat seats and boost the number of Republicans the Lone Star state sends to DC. Other Republican led states are also looking at Gerrymandering the maps ahead of next year's primaries - a normal practice here ever since Governor Elbridge Gerry signed off on the first dodgy redistricting in Massachusetts in 1812 (the local rag, the Boston Gazette, ran a cartoon with Gerry's face drawn onto a Salamander, dubbing the slimy creature a Gerrymander - boy did that one stick!). The California Gerrymander is controversial - not just because it could see the 39% vote share the Republicans get in America's most populous state translate into just four seats out of the 52 that California gets in the House of Representatives (down from nine at the moment). The former Republican governor of California and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been back on TV shows in recent weeks arguing voters should terminate Prop 50 on grounds of democracy. As governor he brought in the law that Prop 50 is supposed to overthrow - having an independent electoral commission draw up the electoral maps, not highly partisan politicians. But with Republicans going into next year's midterm congressional elections with the narrowest majority in the House in a hundred years, they are scrambling to counteract the normal drop of 20 seats that all incumbent ruling parties seem to face at midterms. That would see control of the House pass to the Democrats, throwing a big spanner in the legislative works of the Trump administration - hence the rush to get as much done before November of next year. So yes, these are local elections. It is not about Trump. It is all about Trump. Washington Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Target layoffs hit almost all corners of the business, from merchants to engineers

Time Published: 2025-11-03T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit The story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail Target’s widespread corporate layoffs this week trimmed down teams throughout the company, leaving some who remain picking up responsibilities from those affected. The layoffs included employees spanning across engineering, product design, analytics, guest experience, creative, strategy, merchandising, HR, operations and legal, according to a Modern Retail analysis of around 60 posts from Target employees who posted on LinkedIn this week looking for work, as well as posts from remaining employees. Employees of the Minneapolis-based retailer were informed Tuesday whether or not their positions had been affected. The company decided to cut around 1,000 team members and to not fill an additional 800 open roles, a Target spokesperson confirmed to Modern Retail. Those impacted will continue to receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3, in addition to severance packages. The move is expected to have a noticeable impact on the workloads and sentiment of those who remain with the company. It will also leave hundreds of people — some had been with the company for decades — without work at the tail end of an economically challenging year. Now, Target faces the tall task of rebuilding morale at a time when the company has faced macroeconomic and geopolitical hurdles, criticism over its pullback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, several underwhelming quarters, and an expectation of a low-single digit decline in sales this fiscal year. The Target spokesperson said the change impacted leadership roles at about three times the rate of individual contributors. Minneapolis was home to many of the affected workers, though some in other cities and in India were also laid off. No roles in stores or warehouses were affected, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to share exact numbers on how many employees in each city lost their jobs, though the company filed two Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) letters with the state of Minnesota detailing at least 500 jobs lost in downtown Minneapolis and 287 at its Brooklyn Park offices. Just a few examples of the 1,000 people leaving the company, according to their profiles, include a senior product manager who had worked on collaboration tools for employees; a product development scientist who had worked on pet and health products; recruiters who helped staff distribution centers; and a private-label portfolio manager who previously worked as a buyer of products aimed at LGBTQIA+ consumers. A deluge of LinkedIn posts in the days following the announcements underscored how widespread the layoffs were, and how deeply it cut to the core of a tight-knit business community. Target is one of the largest employers in the state of Minnesota, with a large network of alumni in the area. Remaining workers hyped up their now former colleagues and lamented what the layoffs would do to their workloads, while some people who were impacted during Target’s last mass round of layoffs in 2015 gave advice to this new round of job seekers. “There’s this strange mix of gratitude and heaviness that comes with staying while others go,” Camilo Zapata, a senior manager of site merchandising for beauty who is remaining with the company, wrote on LinkedIn. “For those of us still here, the road ahead will bring new challenges, bigger scopes, and the responsibility to rebuild stability for our teams.” Leaders at the company wrote about how they had lost key support figures on their teams. “You can’t downsize this hard and willy-nilly without that work being pushed on others,” one laid-off employee told Modern Retail on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation. “My sister teams are really upset I was let go, as well as [further] teams I partnered with.” Similarly, Shelbi Craig, senior market research and insights analyst for Roundel, Target’s retail media business, wrote on LinkedIn about two analysts on her team who lost their jobs. One had only been there for a few months, and the other had been in her role for more than two years. “Losing two people who directly supported my work is a huge shift,” Craig wrote. “I’m deeply grateful to still have a job and a steady income in such a challenging job market, but I also feel the weight of what this means — both for those who are facing uncertainty and for those of us feeling the ripple effects of losing close teammates.” A Target spokesperson said the company did not pursue the layoffs to cut costs and instead meant to create a more agile organization that can make faster decisions. “The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” However, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli estimated that the savings from the cuts could come in at around $90 million to $100 million, according to MarketWatch. To be sure, this was based on salaries from Glassdoor and Salary.com that said the average Target corporate salary ran around $90,000 to $100,000. Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce — who has been monitoring retail companies for decades — said moving to not fill whichever jobs are open is typically a cost-cutting measure rather than one of boosting efficiency. He believes this could be a move to simply improve the company’s financial picture after several underwhelming quarters. “You’re not going to get the most strategic force reduction if you’re just simply trying to not hire jobs that are unhired,” Gildenberg said. “I understand what Target’s trying to say, which is that we are trying to get faster and leaner and this is a way to do that, but it also is reasonably obvious that Target’s got economic pressures on it that it needs to sort out.” In an analyst note, David Bellinger, a director and senior analyst for Mizuho Securities who covers consumer and e-commerce companies, said his firm expects more restructuring activity from Target in the months following the busy holiday period. He said the move is “a difficult first of many steps as [Target] moves from its mediocre era into its turnaround era.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us,” Fiddelke wrote in his message to staff, then alluding to the same three goals he outlined in August after being named the company’s next CEO. “It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can lead with merchandising authority; elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests.” Over the coming months, the layoffs will release hundreds of Target employees, largely based in Minneapolis, into the job market. Target is not the only major employer making major changes that impact the region. Paul DeBettignies, founder of Launch Hiring, said he has also spoken with Minneapolis-area workers who were just let go from Amazon and agriculture company Cargill this week. “I’m concerned about the already unemployed folks,” he said. “It just does not help having another pool of — I don’t like to use the word competition, but it’s what it is.” Ted Chalupsky, founder and CEO of The Right Staff, a staffing and recruiting company in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, said his firm is now starting to hear from Target workers who have been laid off and expects to hear from more in the coming weeks. He said that while it’s never a good time to lose a position, he thinks those who have been laid off this month are in a better boat than they would have been had they been in the market a year or two ago. “We’re seeing the job market starting to pick up again,” Chalupsky said, adding that federal interest rate cuts and increased clarity around tariffs have helped make employers more optimistic. “The word that we’re getting back, just in general, from our clientele is that we’re going to see a pickup in hiring over the next two quarters in this market.” Chalupsky said that in 2015, when Target laid off 1,700 people and left 1,400 positions unfilled, many ended up at smaller or mid-sized companies in the region instead of large corporations. He expects the same trend within this round of layoffs. “They ended up actually in better positions,” Chalupsky said. “Many comments that we heard back from these different candidates [were] basically, ‘Gee, if I’d known about this company or this opportunity, I probably would have made this move a long time ago.’” The layoffs come after Target in September began requiring workers to return to its headquarters office three days a week. For some, that means they had to move or at least adopt new routines shortly before being laid off. “As a citizen in the region, I’m kind of annoyed that they would have brought everybody back after Labor Day, and then now have done this,” DeBettignies said. He added that he expects these changes, combined with the controversy around the DEI pullback, to depress worker sentiment at the company and lead to additional departures once the job market heats up a bit more. “I wonder what [Target’s] Glassdoor is going to look like in about 60 days,” DeBettignies said. “It’s not going to be pretty.” Beyond driving immediate sales, brands this year are angling to get into gift guides to help them with SEO and GEO.

Title: US layoffs reflect ‘no hire, more fire’ environment

The US labor marketâs post-pandemic penchant for holding on to employees is coming to an end, analysts say. For years, many large businesses effectively hoarded workers, leading to a âno hire, no fireâ environment; thatâs now shifted to a âno hire, more fireâ job market, a Reuters columnist wrote. Amazon, UPS, Intel, Accenture, and Microsoft have announced layoffs recently, citing shrinking margins and the adoption of AI. Investors have welcomed the job cuts this year; one economist likened the mood to the 1990s, when âwe used to reward companies for letting people go.â The trend carries risks for the broader economy â though experts donât have the full picture without official data, which isnât being released during the US government shutdown.

Title: Something Just Broke – It Appears That A Liquidity Crisis Is Upon Us, And That Is Really Bad News For The Financial Markets

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What is the Fed not telling us? The numbers clearly indicate that big trouble is brewing in the banking system. I wish that I could specifically tell you which banks are in the most trouble, but at this stage we simply aren’t being told anything. They probably figure that the best approach is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible. But they won’t be able to keep a lid on what is going on indefinitely, and when word finally gets out people could start to panic. In recent weeks, bank reserves have fallen to alarmingly low levels. In fact, last week they fell to the lowest level that we have seen in more than four years… US bank reserves have crashed to a four-year low, plunging to about $2.8 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve data, sending fresh warning signals across Wall Street and Washington. The steep decline marks the second straight week reserves have stayed below $3 trillion, a critical threshold analysts say could test the banking system’s liquidity strength. By itself, this doesn’t necessarily signal that we are facing a major crisis. But everyone agrees that what we are witnessing is certainly unusual. What is causing far more alarm is what occurred on Friday. All of a sudden, there was an insane amount of demand for overnight repo cash… Federal Reserve reportedly pumped about $29.4 billion into the markets via overnight repos. That’s a big number and it signals something I’m watching closely. According to the data for “Overnight Repurchase Agreements — Treasury Securities Purchased by the Fed” the figure for Oct 31, 2025 is $29.400 billion. In other words: The Fed is quietly stepping in and stepping up. To me, this is clear evidence that something just broke. Who suddenly needed that much cash? And why did they need it? The chart that I have posted below comes directly from the Federal Reserve, and it should chill you to the core… But that wasn’t the end of it. By the end of the day on Friday, it was quite obvious that something extremely strange had just happened… Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage. The Fed’s Standing Repo Facility lent a total of $50.35 billion on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of $51.8 billion. So what is the bottom line? The bottom line is that it very much smells like a major crisis is brewing. But let’s wait and see what happens on Monday. If we see figures on Monday that are fairly normal, perhaps we have more time before things start breaking loose in the markets. However, if we see even larger numbers on Monday, hold on tight. In either case, the financial markets will not be able to stay disconnected from the real economy forever. Just like in 2008 and 2009, large employers all over the United States have been conducting mass layoffs. Sadly, this time around that includes some of our largest and most prosperous employers… The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. We haven’t seen anything like this in many years. Bankruptcies are soaring, delinquency rates are spiking, thousands of stores and restaurants are permanently shutting their doors, and just about everything just keeps getting more expensive. What we are now facing is being described as “Depression 2.0”. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning and most of the population understands this. In fact, one recent survey discovered that 57 percent of Americans expect economic conditions to get even worse over the next year. Many of you are going to be facing some very hard decisions in the coming months. If you currently have a job that you highly value, I would recommend holding on to it as tightly as you can. But if you feel that it is absolutely necessary to go somewhere else, you will just have to do what you have to do. Just understand that if you leave your current position it will not be easy to find a new one at all. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Many of them didn’t have anything to fall back on, and so large numbers of them also lost their homes. This is one of the reasons why it is so critical to have a sizable emergency fund. At this point, even the mainstream media is stressing the importance of this… Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the economy crashes, that leaves no room to breathe. Having three to six months of essential expenses tucked away can make all the difference when cash flow dries up or jobs disappear overnight. Keep your emergency savings in an easily accessible account, not tied up in volatile investments. It’s not about hoarding—it’s about buying time and peace of mind. When others panic, you’ll have the stability to make smart, calm decisions. I expect things to start moving very quickly now. If the problems in our banking system bubble to the surface and start becoming highly visible, it will create a lot of fear. And it is just a matter of time before our absurdly overvalued stock market takes a dramatic tumble. Of course all of this is happening at a time when so many other elements of “the Perfect Storm” are coming together. We are right on the brink of multiple major wars, global food supplies are rapidly getting tighter, we are being told that the next worldwide pandemic could break out at any moment, and on average the U.S. has been getting hit by a “billion dollar disaster” about every two weeks. I expect so much chaos to be unleashed during the weeks ahead, and that means that we should expect the turmoil that we are currently witnessing on Wall Street to escalate quite a bit more.

Title: Why Millions Of Women Are Choosing Entrepreneurship In 2025

ByCaroline Castrillon, Senior Contributor. In 2024, women started nearly 1 of every 2 new businesses in America. That’s the highest rate on record, according to Gusto’s 2025 New Business Formation study. In addition, between 2019 and 2023, the number of women-owned businesses increased at nearly double the rate of their male counterparts, the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Business Report reveals. Women are leaving traditional corporate roles in unprecedented numbers to pursue entrepreneurship, writing their own rules for what success looks like. One example is April Springer, a former HR professional turned multi-unit business owner with Next Day Access, a provider of mobility and accessibility products. Based in Minneapolis, she owns three locations and also serves as vice president for the Minnesota and Pittsburgh territories. Her first location generated more than $1 million in revenue in its first year. She’s since expanded into multiple markets and now mentors other women in franchising. Her journey offers insights into the most powerful reasons millions of women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate careers. The traditional corporate ladder no longer represents the pinnacle of achievement for many women. Success has become deeply personal, shaped by individual values rather than external expectations. As Springer explains, "I think women are redefining success on their own terms. There's no one-size-fits-all version of what a successful career or life looks like." This shift stems from: Expert Tip: Before making any major career move, write down your personal definition of success in specific, measurable terms. If you find yourself describing someone else's achievements or using vague terms, you haven't defined it yet. Your definition should be so clear you'd know instantly whether you're living it. Traditional employment models weren't built for modern life. More women are seeking careers that can adapt to their evolving priorities, whether that's family responsibilities, personal passions or the desire for autonomy over their schedules. As Springer explains, "The traditional corporate path doesn't always offer the flexibility, fulfillment or creativity many women are seeking. Entrepreneurship allows women to design a life and career that align with their values and priorities." What flexibility really means: Expert Tip: Track your energy and productivity patterns for two weeks. If your current job structure conflicts with your natural rhythms and priorities more than 60% of the time, that's a signal that entrepreneurship might serve you better. The rise of social media has transformed how women view entrepreneurship. Platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok showcase real stories of women building successful businesses, making the path to entrepreneurship feel more accessible than ever before. Springer notes the impact of this visibility, "Social media has also played a big role in this shift. When women see others building successful businesses and balancing life in ways that inspire them, it creates momentum." The digital community effect includes: Expert Tip: Follow 10-15 women entrepreneurs in your industry on social media. Don't just scroll—actively engage. Comment on their posts, ask questions and join conversations. The connections you build digitally often translate into real mentorship and support when you launch your own venture. For women who want to be their own boss but feel intimidated by starting from scratch, franchising presents a compelling middle ground. Franchise models provide proven systems, established branding and built-in support networks that significantly reduce the risk associated with new business ventures. The franchise advantage includes: Expert Tip: Before investing in any franchise, speak with at least five current franchisees you choose yourself—not the ones referred by the franchisor. Ask specifically about hidden costs, actual time commitments and whether they'd make the same choice again. Many women entrepreneurs aren’t just chasing profits. They’re building small businesses with purpose. The desire to create meaningful impact drives many women to leave stable corporate positions for the uncertainty of entrepreneurship. Mission-driven businesses benefit from: Expert Tip: Define your business mission in one sentence: "We help [specific people] achieve [specific outcome] so they can [meaningful benefit]." If you struggle to complete this sentence clearly, spend more time refining your purpose. A vague mission won't sustain you through entrepreneurship's challenges. Amazon recently announced 14,000 corporate job cuts, while Target eliminated 1,000 roles. Entire departments can disappear overnight due to restructuring, automation or economic shifts. For many women, entrepreneurship offers more control over their financial future than any corporate job ever could. When you own your business, your income depends on your own efforts, not on someone else's decision to cut headcount. Why women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate jobs: Expert Tip: If you're concerned about leaving your corporate job, start your business as a side hustle while still employed. Test your concept, build a client base and validate your income potential before making the leap. Many successful entrepreneurs launch this way, reducing risk while proving their business model works. The millions of women pursuing entrepreneurship today aren't abandoning ambition. They're redefining it on their own terms. It proves the best career path isn’t always the one laid out by someone else. Often, it’s the one you build yourself.

Title: Thawing Housing Market Not Yet Liquid Enough to Jump-Start Sales

Rejuvenating frozen US housing sales will require a strong job market and mortgage rates low enough to pique sellers’ interest in new homes. Emell Derra Adolphus Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Since the 1993 classic Groundhog Day never specifies exactly how long it took Bill Murray’s character to escape his repetitive purgatory in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, fans devoted enough to run the numbers have come up with their own estimate: 33 years. Players in the US housing market hope to escape the numbers-driven winter of their discontent quite a bit sooner, but green shoots are sparse so far and last week didn’t do much to help. The nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, saw its proverbial shadow, signaling on a Tuesday earnings call that it expects cooling housing sales to continue into next year, with angsty buyers chilled by relatively high mortgage rates and growing economic uncertainty. Earlier in the month, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index measured builder confidence at 37 on a scale of 0 to 100, the highest since April, but still well below the level that would indicate most are optimistic about the short-term outlook. “The housing sector remains weak,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a news conference on Wednesday after the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point in response to growing concern about employment, a key factor in home purchases. The unemployment rate in the US ticked up to 4.3% in August, the last month for which the government collected data before a shutdown that has obscured the state of the job market despite anecdotal evidence of thousands of layoffs by corporate giants from e-commerce leader Amazon to shipping company UPS. “Job growth absolutely has an impact on new household formations and consumer confidence, and where you see that flatness in those markets, that is going to have an impact,” D.R. Horton Chief Executive Officer Paul Romanowski said on the company’s earnings call on Tuesday. Horton’s average sales price for single-family homes fell 3% from the previous year to $365,600 in the three months through September, D.R. Horton said. At the same time, leaning “pretty hard” into incentives such as buydowns that took mortgage rates as low as 3.99% for some purchasers trimmed 110 basis points from the company’s gross profit margin. As for how long it might take the market to heat up again, Romanowski offered a gauge, but not a timetable: “We need to see consistent, sustainable job growth to drive growth in the housing market.” From Romanowski’s mouth to the Federal Reserve’s ears. Still, the two rate cuts so far this year may not be sufficient to propel much of a rebound in the housing market, according to economists. “Single-family home sales may be climbing out of the basement, but they haven’t reached the ground floor yet, let alone any higher level,” said Associated General Contractors of America Chief Economist Ken Simonson. Despite data from the National Association of Home Builders showing that firms like D.R. Horton have succeeded in stimulating sales by building smaller houses, cutting prices and buying down interest rates for customers, “numerous policy initiatives are working against homebuilding and housing sales,” he said. Steep US government tariffs on “Canadian softwood lumber and on steel, aluminum, copper products, kitchen cabinets, vanities, upholstered furniture and more are pushing up construction costs,” Simonson said. The fluctuation in levy amounts, meanwhile, makes home planning and pricing even more difficult. Glimmers of hope are appearing in the market, however. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to a range of 6.2% to 6.3% from the level of 6.6% where it hovered most of the year. It’s encouraging, but “not enough of a cut to bring forth a surge of homebuyers,” Simonson said. Another interest-rate cut like October’s might help, but the improvement would be only incremental, and the reduction is far from a “foregone conclusion,” the Fed’s Powell said. Still, after several years of surging mortgage rates and shrinking of home inventory, “a weaker economy, increasingly impatient sellers, and slowly receding mortgage rates are helping tilt certain housing markets toward buyers,” said economist and Sage Policy Group CEO Anirban Basu. “The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index has dipped for five consecutive months,” Basu said. “Bottom line: 2026 will be the best year to buy a home in a number of years.” Some parts of the US have shown firm demand, too, Basu said. Among them is the country’s south, where states such as Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Texas are attracting a steady stream of movers, said Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research for the National Association of Realtors. “People continue to move toward areas with better affordability and growing employment opportunities,” she explained. “Follow the people to see where housing demand will be stronger.” Demand is already spreading into Midwestern cities such as Des Moines, Omaha and Kansas City, she said, “with Kansas City experiencing a more than 50% increase in net domestic migration last year.” Thanks to comparatively high prices and labor market concerns, the supply of existing homes is approaching pre-pandemic levels, Oxford Economics Analyst Matthew Martin wrote in a report. At the state level, Tennessee, Texas, Colorado and Florida have experienced some of the largest increases in listings compared with pre-pandemic levels, Evangelou said. “Tennessee alone has about 35% more homes for sale than in 2019. Many of these same states have also seen the most new construction,” she said. “Exactly what the market has needed for years: more supply. Still, many of these homes are priced above what most buyers can afford.” Another complication is spillover from recent periods of low interest rates, including those during the pandemic and previously, during and after the Great Recession. Buyers who financed homes at rates of less than 3% then are reluctant to give them up in favor of new loans that cost twice as much. “But we have started to see some easing,” Evangelou added. “The inventory of existing homes available for sale is now at its best level in five years, suggesting more homeowners are finally listing.” She predicted a gradual improvement next year “as mortgage rates ease further and stabilize near 6%.” In September, in fact, the number of US homes sold popped 7.3% to about 442,400, according to real estate company Redfin. So if someone else gets stuck in a Groundhog Day time loop (in the unlikely event of a sequel), at least he or she will have a better chance of landing a new home after escaping Punxsutawney. The United States agreed to reduce broad tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points, bringing them to 47%. Execs said that inflation-addled consumers are under the impression that Chipotle costs more than it does. When layoffs rise, people spend less, which leads to tighter bottom lines and more layoffs. Wash, rinse, and repeat. In September, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that nine of the Fed’s 19 policymakers favored no more than one additional rate cut this year. Tariffs and the end of the de minimis exemption have been a one-two punch eroding UPS’ core business in 2025. The recent investment from private equity firms could help protect Keurig Dr Pepper from activist investors like Starboard. The S&P 500 has climbed 35% since its April low and roughly 90% since the beginning of its bull run in 2022. China’s GDP growth fell to 4.8% in the third-quarter, down from 5.2% in the second quarter and the slowest pace in a year. Counterpoint data found the iPhone 17 lineup outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in the US and China for its first 10 days. The chip manufacturer, headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, was acquired in 2019 by state-backed Chinese semiconductor firm Wingtech. The announcement comes months after Apple said it’d invest $100 billion in US factories as part of its “American Manufacturing Program.” Shares of the crop trading and processing giant soared as POTUS threatened “retribution” over China’s de facto US soybean embargo © 2025 The Daily Upside

I don’t know why people become serial killers nor do I even care. I only know what should be done with them – and with extreme prejudice. “Why are we obsessed with serial killers?” Maybe because the killer in me is the killer in you…. Disarm, by Billy Corgan So I’ve watched a few of these series below on the central villain, and there is overlap of a kind, like deciphering whether the cult leader( ie, Jeffs ) or the serial killer is actually the worse and more effective evil. Exerting control seems to be a recurring theme. – Jeffrey Dahmer – Warren Jeffs and the FLDS cult ( polygamy ) – Ted Bundy – John Wayne Gacy – Zodiac These are all dark, and highly disturbing. I include the last entry since per the film, released in 2007 and possibly overlooked then, the alleged murderer was never actually caught or arrested for his crimes. My conclusion…some people are just not wired correctly from the get to. I actually have been a little curious about what the big deal is. Where I live, gang members have tens of bodies under their belts. There’re also a whole host of famous people who should be called serial killers but aren’t, like Obama. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that they lack individual notoriety for their crimes, for one reason or the other. The article doesn’t address this at all, unless I missed it and I would agree that the author’s reported curiousity may be less ubiquitous than they believe. It seems to me like the fascination with learning how other persons met with a miserable end is a phenomenom driven by news outlets (traditional and novel) hyping up particularly unique cases as a relatively easy sell for views/clicks etc.. The difference in the treatment is just stark. My news is always filled with the more prolific of the twenty or so deaths over the last week, sometimes barely afforded a paragraph because it’s the same old story over and over. Even when bodies do get found in pieces it’s not particularly earth-shattering. As far as I can tell, it seems to be that having a hundred known victims can never live up to the hype of leaving three of four bodies in sculpted positions. ‘Slasher’ enthusiasts, I’m sure, hardly care to learn how Joe went from selling his body for food to doing his part, keeping morticians securely employed. Mass murderers, spree killers, serial killers are categories, but I guess the category closest to covering officially protected perps would be something like “state sponsorsed terrorism”. US media is obsessed with serial killers (‘we’ means them), because shocking content attracts audience. It’s softcore atrocity porn. A polarizing film but one I think captured this well was Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers”. It’s too graphic and psychedelic for some but the way it portrays the media hype and popular fandom around a duo of serial killers was phenomenal in my opinion. Takes the old adage of “If it bleeds, it leads” and turned the dial up to eleven to critique the 90’s era tabloid news like Hard Copy. Not sure if there are any modern equivalents but to me that film still holds up and remains relevant. In an awful comparison, serial killers are tantamount to aces in that you need 5 kills to establish yourself as such. Note to gun nuts intent on doing your worst: Any outcome in the single-digits is pretty much yeah whatever as far as Presstidigitation is concerned. It might not even make the front page of the internet-such is fate. By serial killers, do they mean social murders? Kills more people than any serial killer ever has. On the AI front, this below in today’s FT reporting the same thing that commenter Rasperry Jam has been saying, that much of AI’s immediate future is in specialized foundation models using proprietary data. . No archived link yet — https://www.ft.com/content/91002071-7874-4cb7-9245-08ca0571c408 The new hot job in AI: forward-deployed engineers OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere have stepped up hiring for specialists to help businesses adopt their AI models ‘…Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere are recruiting for so-called forward-deployed engineers, a new job for generative AI companies, as part of a push to generate more revenues by installing specialists within businesses to help them customise their AI models…. ‘…The move comes as businesses across industries from manufacturing to healthcare are increasingly keen to adopt AI tools, but are often unsure how to use the technology and generate a return on investment. “A Fortune 500 bank has completely different needs than a start-up building an AI-native product,” said Cat de Jong, head of applied AI at Anthropic …. ‘While FDEs (forward-deployed engineers) represent a relatively small number of AI groups’ workforce, OpenAI said demand for these roles has exceeded its expectations. ‘The group used this approach to customise its technology for John Deere, an agricultural machinery manufacturer, to help create more precise farming tools. This resulted in farmers reducing chemical spraying by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. ‘OpenAI’s Fournier said: “We learn what customers in different industries really need, we experiment and innovate together, and then those insights help advance OpenAI’s research and product offerings based on what works in the real world.” Me: This is AI coming for McKinsey, Bain, and the like. i.e. Customers used to contract with a management consultancy firm, which then outourced a majority of work to an IT consultancy firm (ITF) that in turn might do 90% of work for 10% of contract value and the MCF took the rest. Any true value lay in which ITF the management consultant firm had the nous to choose. With AI, the ITF — in this case, OpenAI, Anthropic, whichever– disintermediates McKinsey etc. and assigns their role to its own forward development engineers. So if those forward-deployed engineers are working with a Fortune 500 bank or a corporation like John Deere to tailor those AIs to them individually, would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Yup. One thought, suppose there are better, more efficient AI models than Anthropic or Claude, buying into solution before problem…. Don’t rule out consulting yet. How about small language modules? Open labs* are raining small language models right now, some under 1B parameters, which is small enough to work (with patience) on any laptop. Most recently, LiquidAI published open-weight small models specialized for retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, information extraction, and mathematics. There has been a lot of recent work in vision and OCR surfacing recently as well. Small models are becoming more capable and efficient not only to encode or translate the text of a page or sign or describe a photo, but correctly read and reproduce sparse tables or describe the actions occurring between two video frames (with bounding boxes). * By open labs I mean those whose corporate future is not dependent on a world where all inference is centralized in a proprietary cloud, and who are not so motivated to hoard their IP or models. OpenAI and Anthropic, contrariwise, are worthless unless they can force the Western world to channel all its mechanical language processing through their machines and their meters. I think of OpenAI and Anthropic much like Uber, as regulatory plays intending to construct a regulatory environment in which the highly moderated service they offer is socially necessary, and alternatives are rendered illegal, unmerchantable, or impossible. Reminder that the “anti”-AI movement is only a shaping operation in the larger war against local computation, and, being mainly funded and operated by US AI services majors, national security goons, and washed-up pundits trying to uphold a lifestyle, should only ever be held with the same absolute suspicion and cynical hostility as any other corporate astroturf. The myth is not entirely wrong for some health conditions. My mother-in-law had polio as an infant. At some point in her seventies and eighties she (and the medical profession discovered that her muscles only had so many contractions in them and that the exercises she had been doing to maintain her strength were weakening her. would it also work out that they would also be funneling those corporation’s vital information back to Anthropic, OpenAI and Cohere for use as training set data? Typically legal agreements are signed between the model provider and the company purchasing the services that the purchaser’s proprietary data, code, trade-protected processes – anything that falls under IP – remains under the control of the purchaser and is not the property of the model provider. What this means in practice is more nuanced: these companies are hiring the FDE’s as part of a service to create fine-tuned models trained on the customer’s data and processes, for exclusive use by the purchasing company. I’ve worked on projects like this for my company; we didn’t have access to the customer’s IP directly. What we did was brought in the trainer application(s), taught the purchasing customer how to train their model, and provided guidance on how to configure, evaluate and deploy it after it was complete. We also taught them how to prompt/interact with the models based on what they were trying to do. We – and likely these other model providers – provide the purchasing company with the model trainer because taking the customer’s IP out of their network is a) probably too much data, I’m talking in excess of 50 terabytes b) no company’s security team is going to sign off on that no matter how lucrative/cool the end use case will be. So no, they probably aren’t taking the customer’s IP and sending it back to the primary frontier models for training in the way you are describing. They’re making a smaller version of the frontier model trained on the customer’s IP, for the customer’s exclusive use. The FDE are running the training and internal education projects. Sounds like Lean Six Sigma “black belts”. Maybe if Toyota did AI….. Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” Do these OpenAI deployed engineers have the business sense, to replace the usual business process redesign “help” They don’t work solo, they are always paired with an “echo” team member (sometimes called a deployment strategist) who is the business/pm/person who interfaces directly with the customer technical and business leads. The FDE takes their orders from the DS; the customer yells at/makes demands of the DS. The DS is responsible for initial technical requirements gathering and “phoning home” to the company when business facets change (expansion, contraction, new opportunities, etc). They aren’t there to fully alter the purchasing customer’s business processes but to help the customer achieve their goals with their purchase of the AI services. So it is more of an on-site service partnership than an outside consultant. I lead the deployment strategist team at my company. The “forwards deployed” vocabulary is very militaristic. This strategy of embedding technical staff in the client on an open-ended consulting / brain-siphoning engagement is held up as the secret of Palantir’s “success”. I wonder if the buzzword comes from them too…. Anyway, we’re doing exactly this with our AI Fintech, building a very niche model and, yes, hiring forward deployed engineers for its deployment. Hell’s bells, those photos of the ultra-refined pizza(s) are ridiculous. As every Italian knows, pizza is its own food group, but there are rules. (Although in the Undisclosed Region the use of ingredients and doughs has some jazz-like variations, given that pizza is an exotic import from Naples and not original to the Chocolate City.) Lobster and caviar defeat the purpose of pizza, which is as a comfort food that doesn’t have too much meat or fish on top. It is the dough that matters. Second, I am seeing two other pizzas that aren’t pizzas. I’m not sure what the photos represent. They seem to be of a taco masquerading as a pizza — pieces of burnt sausage with raw lettuce, raw tomatoes, and sliced pickles? Or is this pizzaoidal object a discreet reference to Donald Trump’s eating habits? So these gold-foiled pizzas with pickles are a long way from a real pizza — which reaches the splendor of pizza when topped with cheese and squash blossoms. Or one of those jazzy Piedmontese variations (served at my Undisclosed Favorite Pizzeria): sauce of porcini, topped with porcini and a delicate Piedmontese cheese that is softer and a tad more savory than mozzarella. (Not that I’m complaining about mozzarella!) Heck, why waste a sturgeon’s time like this? PS: From Renato Viola’s home page, I discover that he has decamped to Miami, South Beach. Sic transit gloria pizzae. Thank you! I second that it’s the dough/crust first and foremost. I enjoy anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) from time to time, and have even once made a lobster pizza (it was tasty!), but these are not what I crave when I’m craving pizza. The State of Maine pizza, bacon and onion, is one of my favorites. mrsyk: anchovies (with capers and red onion, please) Anchovies are an object of veneration in the Undisclosed Region — especially the big anchovies from Spain or Sicily. So I understand your weaknesses. Once at my son’s urging we did a lobster fried rice as he said St Tony Bourdain had it. We did it without my wife present (the chef, the boss). It was good. Later my son said he made it up about Tony. There is a fancier Chinese restaurant nearby that makes a lobster fried rice and it’s delicious! They also do a nice dim sum lobster rangoon. I wouldn’t do lobster on a pizza [or mashed potatoes(!), looking at you Barstool-reviewed local Maine pizza place that is otherwise very good], but I find that substituting real lobster for the generally faux crabmeat in Asian cuisine is a nice touch. Horrible faux crabmeat is a nasty substitution for… real crab. Up here, on the BC Coast, the real thing is thankfully far more common — fake crab is extremely rare in Chinese restaurants, much more common in bad or mediocre Japanese restaurants, the latter often having both California Rolls and California Rolls with Real Crab on the menu. Saladizzas? Note ingredients seem to have been added after the pizza is done. Weird. I myself have done some weird dishes as I sometimes tried to be creative with mixed results. Paella madrás comes to mind. That one was edible and quite a thing though I have not tried twice. With time my “creativity” has mostly gone and now I stick most of the time with traditional recipes even if some are new to me. No garlic in the Spanish omelette then? (I’m torn on this one.) Onion, onion! And you can do it “campera” (country-side) with added pepper and chorizo. One bite, everybody knows the rules! In our town we used to have a pizza place called the Pizza Research Institute (PRI) that had the most unusual pizza toppings I’ve ever encountered. Many of my friends raved about it but as a half-Sicilian pizza traditionalist I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to try them. Unfortunately I really did like their pizza (except anything with Gorgonzola, a cheese apparently made from someone’s very dirty underwear). Example: the 3-P ….. pear, potato, and pesto. I know, I know…but it was brilliant. Laughingsong: Sicilian pizza (which is not sfinciune, which is wonderful) is what we in Chicago used to call the pizza of risen dough with much tomato sauce and very little cheese. You’d buy it buy the rectangle at certain bakeries. Oh, no, I feel Proust’s pizza calling… Note on sfinciune: I bought a slice of sfinciune at a nice grocery store in Palermo. It was ambrosial. Cheesy, plus a topping of gratinata, lots of breadcrumbs. Give it a try. Pear, potato, and pesto. The problem is that the pear’s elegant sweetness competes with the pesto’s wonderful perfume. The umami of the potato can’t rescue that threesome. That’s one of the dangers of threesomes. Now: Here in the Undisclosed Region you’d get potato, pesto, and hazelnuts (another object of veneration) or walnuts. Yumliziosa. Yeah, I dunno what any of that is. I did a Neapolitan style 10.5″ last night with a pizza oven, cooked up in about 2 minutes, starts to seriously burn at that point actually. Amazingly puffy but thin crust, overnight yeasted dough, just 00 flour, yeast, water, a bit of salt, and 1/8″ teaspoon of olive oil and a bit of amylase. Pesto, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and scallions. Best thing ever. Call me a pizza pedestrian, but I prefer mine Montreal style (with the cheese on top) with salty meat toppings — never any vegetables. About “Entrepreneurship in Europe: Where are firms thriving and barely surviving? ” As far as I can tell what the data shows is mostly about how easy and cheap it is to set up and close down shell-companies. I.e. financial shenanigans that on balance is probably damaging both economy and lives. I did not see any reference to that being part of the explanation, either the author is blissfully unaware of that or the author is aware and decided not to include it anywhere in the article. Might be a combination of unaware and being slightly aware but digging into it and writing about it might not be good for career and social prospects. “Opinion: Why Trump’s talk about nuclear testing is dangerous” I’m thinking that it was defensive here. The Russians had just announced the successful testing of their nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik. This was followed up by the successful testing of their nuclear-powered torpedo, the Poseidon. For the Neocons, this was bad news. It is one thing setting countries on fire in the Middle east or Africa or South America. They told themselves that they were safe as they had an ocean on each side, Arctic wastes to the north and a narrow peninsular to the south. With these new weapons that obsolete belief is dead. Trump had to throw up a distraction so that people would forget those new Russian weapons so came up with nuclear testing and it has worked. Only thing is whether Trump boxes himself in and is forced to conduct a nuclear test in a year or two from now because of all his belligerent boasting. It was another childish gesture. (Mine’s bigger than yours.) Quotidian Trumpian bravado. It’s not easy being a narcissist. My best guess is he doesn’t know the difference between nuclear powered and nuclear armed. I read someone point out trumps testing talk came just after his TACO with China. It’s round 10 million of SQUIRREL Nuclear testing is under the energy department, not the military. It would take probably years to put together the entire nuclear test program again before a single test could be completed. Historians will look back on 2025 as the US empire’s Suez year, with not just China’s successful pushback against US efforts to stop its rise but also Russia’s crushing of the Ukraine regime and the US-NATO proxy effort to regime change Russia. But, yes: 2030, if the Chinese perform a landing on Luna, is when this change will finally be absorbed by the mass of Americans. Those in DC will likely be the last to face the facts. Here’s The Duran weighing in on this, and I have the same concerns: Poseidon and Trump nuclear testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugtS1clYjEI Plus, they also discuss the myth that Reagan “won” the Cold War with an arms race, and yes, it’s a myth. I don’t know the details of what brought the USSR down, but I dare say that having old, out of touch, corrupt leadership class that caused great internal disarray was a much greater reason for the USSR’s collapse. (And I see parallels in America’s leadership today, bummer that!) Nexperia allowed to resume exports from China following Trump-Xi talks — companies may seek exemptions from the Ministry of Commerce to restart international deliveries Tom’s Hardware It appears that the USA’s famously brilliant negotiator of a president may not have understood what he agreed to with regard to Nexperia in his recent discussions with Xi. Per Arnaud Bertrand, the main value added by Nexperia NL to the supply chain of chips used in the auto industry is the production of the silicon wafers. Nexperia CN has now re-sourced those wafers domestically, which will leave Nexperia NL to wither away and the American and European auto producers even more dependent on China. Good job, wheeler-dealer Don. There are still propaganda pieces in the Netherlands that Karremans did a great and heroic thing in stealing Nexperia. I always knew that the Dutch press was mostly propaganda, but sometimes it is still a surprise for me when they lie about something. There is a bus-sized hole in that agreement in that China made no commitment to actually approve shipments to Nexperia. In the case of rare earth exports, despite a commitment to resume shipments back in April, very few were approved over the next months. so I scrolled through news sites….no mention of the World Series, lmao. (the secular, structural decline of baseball is another topic). Society/mass culture has become, essentially, circles of “fandoms”—politics, sports, celebrity news, baking, widget-collecting, etc. There is no more universal (national) cultural glue holding society together (except, a John Carpenter-esque: consume!) pretty wild that we live in an age where almost every First Worlder has a supercomputer in their pocket, and people have siloed themself into their own world with their own IV drip of info. it’s like a scene from “Wall-E” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk The only hint of violence on the diamond sputtered out during an ad hoc 7th inning stretch yesterday, but it was more of an Elks Club get together with no rabbit punches or fisticuffs to report and both teams dutifully went back to their respective dugouts… In comparison, I cringe about 6.3x a game during an NFL get together-when violence on the gridiron seems almost like a gut punch to watch. A lot of the skills are similar, throwing, running, catching and hitting-with a different variant on the latter. That was a World Series for the ages-one astounding play on the field after another, and I had mentally consigned myself to being on the losing side of an epic battle fought over 90 feet at a time in the 9th inning, satisfied in that i’d witnessed something special-and then redeemed by home run heroics by the least likely guy on the rosters to clear the fence. p,s, money, money, money dept: Disney owned the Angels around the turn of the century, and in their wisdom decided to trash all of the older players contracts, which were dutifully retrieved by a dumpster diver, and then sold to a coin dealer in Orange County. The ‘money’ one was Nolan Ryan’s yearly contracts, of which there were about 10 or so, and Nolan didn’t make jack, $27k. I must’ve read through hundreds of player contracts, got a little dull after awhile ah ha The internet has everything! Here’s the 1972 Nolan Ryan contract, and oh so plain Jane~ It fetched $6k in 2012 @ auction https://collectrea.com/archives/2012/Spring/767/1972-nolan-ryan-signed-california-angels-contract-first-american-league-contract On Nolan Ryan, when I worked at corporate HQ office of a local retail bank in Plano, Texas, circa 2011 to early 2012 my immediate manager was a Texas Rangers. Centered on the front wall of his office and opposite his desk was the timeless portrait of Ryan giving the business to an unfortunate Robin Ventura. Apparently there was disagreement on the high heat coming out of his right arm…. Always a shame that Ryan wasn’t gifted better team ownership or good franchise circumstances once he left the NY Mets; ok I guess the Astros had some years in the early to mid 80s after all. But for Ryan….No Cy Young award, but all them no hitters! It’s a new age, and it’s filled with football (of the international variety). Go check out an MLS game … Portland vs San Diego was absolutely electric last night. Fans singing, smoke flying, drums drumming, banners waving, stands bouncing. It is it’s OWN culture, and it’s international. Black, white, brown … every nation in the world represented. It’s called “the beautiful game” for a reason, and the beauty extends beyond the pitch. Maybe nobody’s talking about it because they can’t bear to admit that capitalism’s favorite team came out on top. I do like the individual Dodger players, and Ohtani especially is a pleasure to watch. And I do thank LA for taking a bunch of bunch of past their prime players with bloated contracts off the Red Sox’ hands several years ago. But LA is second only to the hated Yankees for teams I actively root against. It’s a team only PE C-suiters could love. Must be nice to bring in a billion dollars worth of pitchers for the last few weeks of the regular season and the p(l)ayoffs. Not every team has that luxury. Any mention of the Dodgers at NC should go under the guillotine watch. I dunno, fell under the spell of Dodger Stadium-the only 1960’s NL baseball stadium still left standing-and unlike most of the other 60’s efforts in that regard, didn’t have the awful dual MLB/NFL thing going on. Haven’t been to a game there this century, so i’m a little rusty-but oh the memories they linger pleasantly enough. From what i’ve seen on tv, the aged edifice looks to have more advertising than I remember seeing, but I’m from the era when trying to make money on such things was considered crass-so it was scant. The only indication @ Dodger Stadium was a big Union 76 orange ball on top of a pillar, so clean. Watched a NHL game from the 70’s awhile back and the boards are bereft of branding, naked as it were-they almost looked whitewashed in fact. Other than the link above? Do mega-sporting events like the World Series pay off? Here’s the economic reality behind them Or was this post a comment in reaction to it?

I can only imagine the panic in the Trump regime as the Chinese get closer and closer to their objective but it is not like they are doing anything about this goal themselves. There is no permanent head of NASA and the guy at SecTransport is acting head – while muttering about how NASA should be folded into the Department of Transport. And he has thrown contracts open again meaning that there is no clear set path to launch a Moon flight but competing corporations who probably have their own ideas how things should be done. But no doubt that Trump will stick to his demand that there be an American on the Moon before the end of his term. It’s a good thing that JFK never said that but only that it be before the end of the decade. “‘The money machine is misfiring’: City blames Brexit for UK’s £20bn productivity headache” What does “productivity” even mean when applied to a parasitic rent-seeking sector? The article actually addresses this but then turns away. One cannot stare into the sun! Of talks about how the historic UK productivity figures were driven by the productivity of the City and it has now cratered and brought the productivity figures down with it. I would like to see an analysis but I wonder if the current low measured productivity is actually any lower than before in many sectors (services), when finance is stripped out. The real new productivity crisis in the UK is in manufacturing as a result of higher energy and commodity costs because of war on Russia. And possibly the explosion of low wage jobs using the boom in legal economic migration (and the no wage jobs using illegal migrants). time change sucks if yer already insomniac and yer vertebrae wake you at 230am. anyhoo..this made the dog and catpile jump up off of me and flee: https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1984812876398485824 ‘This one is more accurate…😂’ https://xcancel.com/FPSPredatorsHA/status/1984849553355628689#m In a nutshell…, lol. I’m pretty thankful for the dog and catpile these nights. The fur-ball foursome got btus to spare. yeah…before it was just Osa the dog, and Bob the Cat(who has always been kind of a dick)…but the 3 juvenile cats that were friendly to me at the bar…i brought them into the house while i went on my catmurder spree. and they have become fixtures…much more cuddly than Bob ever was(he hates them,lol)so i have Bob behind my head in the pillownest, Osa along my right thigh, and 3 little cats piled up on my legs. makes it hard to get up for coffee in the am. or to tend the woodstoves, etc. but they are a welcome source of heat…and pretty good company, so far…galloping alongside me back and forth as i go about my doins. theyve also apparently inspired Osa to follow me around more. she likes them, wants to play, etc…but they’re wary,lol. and this sorta cold am(for me,lol-, was the first time she didnt growl when one of them slipped off my legs and nuzzled against her. still…a warm woman would be preferable… Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth ScienceDaily Scientists just discovered something that runners and cyclists knew all along. Even amateurs know that measuring pulse after waking up is how one can gauge change over time, and that it gets lower as you get in shape. These results challenge a long-held belief, once repeated by US President Donald Trump, that the human body is like a battery with a limited energy supply and that exercise only depletes it. LOL, Trump science. Believe it or not, that was the first guy on the Moon’s thoughts, too. I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats… and I don’t intend to waste any of mine. Neil Armstrong That’s why he took one small step in stead of one giant leap. Another example of why someone being an expert in one thing does not translate to them knowing jack about anything else. Yet, for some reason there’s no end to the various celebrities opining on important topics, tech oligarchs getting the grubby mits on everything, and me here in the comments sharing my opinion on stuff I clearly know nothing about. …got the extended warranty on heartbeats 100 billion, or 100 years-whatever comes first. And here I’ve been thinking I only had a set number of heart beats allowed per day and exceeding that number would be instant death. Guess I no longer have that excuse to not exercise! Why Do Spiders Decorate Their Webs? A New Piece of the Puzzle Nautilus ~~~~~~~~~~~ I find black widow webs to be the most fascinating, almost looks as if the 8 legged one was on an acid trip during construction of. So intricate and chaotic-but with a purpose. Then there was the time NASA fed various psychotropics to spiders and photographed the results. See: https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/nasa-spiders-drugs-experiment/ Here’s a video that introduced me to that research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZoZhM0E8Ow I work in this area and this is my experience. Large companies (and some not so large) are extremely paranoid about allowing the AI companies to use their vital information for training. The major AI players all sell private instances where users are assured that no one outside of their company can use their data for training or analyze the custom models. They put language in contracts and audits are conducted by 3rd parties to verify these claims. Its above my pay grade to determine what they are really doing behind the scenes, but given the way the contracts are written it would be a major scandal if they ever got caught cheating. A big worry to many is the user sending private information to the models running in public instances which do not have these guarantees. My employer blocks these sites, and we’re all told to use the private version. A second worry that is coming on strong is the use of Chinese models like DeepSeek and Qwen (even privately maintained versions using open source) . More companies are adopting policies where these are forbidden because, I assume, the Chinese cannot be trusted. One company described it as “geopolitical models are forbidden”. Re: Scientists just shattered a major exercise myth This is not new. back in the 70’s a friend gave me the “using up extra heartbeats” thing and I pointed out that: 3 mile run at 160 beats per min 160*20 = 3200 beats warm up cool down and other activity 120 beats per min 120*40 = 4800 beats resting pulse 50 for the rest of the day 23*60*50 = 69000 beats total 3200 + 4800 +69000 = 77000 beats per day him resting pulse 72*24*60 = 103689 beats per day (this assumes that during every day activity, his pulse is the same amount above resting pulse as mine) he started taking the stairs yeah this is some seriously auld news. It’s good to get it out there anyway as lots of the kids these days are all weights and no cardio. All weights and no cardio is also auld news, and no legs day too. ‘Massimo @Rainmaker1973 Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school.’ If those kids are doing a 12 hour day, then this is a vital necessity. I really like the way those desks converted into beds and they could teach the airlines a few tricks. You can see that there are multiple models here in use. And after those kids have their nap, they are ready to absorb more lessons. Of course if you read the replies to this tweet, you will find many sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1983685284827918711 I particularly liked the cabinets that had a whole bed hidden inside!! I could see a big market and lot of people making use of them. Homeless facilities, detention centers, airbnbs, Americans just trying to survive they’re inequality… Also, how is the United States education system going to compete with China? 12 hours of instruction a day! (Minus naps) I think car makers might be wise to incorporate some of the design implemented in the Chinese school desks to enable cars to become mobile homes … of a sort. Even dead cars could provide a home for the growing hordes of homeless. I have mixed feelings about 12 hours per day of instruction for school children. I learned the most from my own studies after I came home from school and from the time I spent at the public library and in my room attempting to write the most convincing essay I could for a homework assignment. Once I reached an age of double digits, I estimate that many, though not all days, I may have spent more than 12 hours per day studying when I add my study at home with the time spent in the classroom. I also greatly value the time I spent learning to play a musical instrument, or wandering in nature and in museums or attending the Summer Shakespeare plays and orchestral concerts my parents brought me and my siblings to. I believe schools and parents should foster a love for learning, endless curiosity, imagination, and questioning the ‘right answer’ in a way I did not see or sense in the schooling of my own children. As u.s. school are constituted, a 12 hour school day would bring the death of learning and those attributes I value. Son #1 is currently at a school where a 12h day is possible, if he went in for breakfast (07:30) and stayed for dinner (18:00) and left when the boarders do their prep (19:30ish). As it is, an 8.5h day is standard (08:45-17:15). He often goes in early for breakfast because it is a full English (sausages and bacon, hash browns, black pudding, eggs etc) but only stays late to play DnD! He also has Saturday school…. “Son #1” sounds like a name Musk would give to one of his kids. :) FYI that the Sonar 21 link seems to have some information it shouldn’t in the link URL. It came from a subscriber and needs to be cleaned up after the “?”. AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs – Futurism There should be a case study about that headline as being indicative of a larger problem. The real headline, more descriptive of the contents of the article and the reality (and also very catchy) is buried at the last paragraph: “AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs.” I drove by a ‘natural’ park in an arroyo yesterday, with pretty steep terrain, and a driverless mower on a two-track hydrostatic system was being driven by a parks worker with a R/C joystick gizmo, a dozen or so parks workers in sweatshirt uniforms watching. I circled back, got some pics, talked with El Jefe for a couple minutes. Asked him how soon he would plot waypoints via GPS, and have a computer driving it from an office with the lights off, the mower automatically re-docking to recharge batteries, and how many fewer staff he would have? He opined there was always weed-whacking to be done, doubted any man-power cuts. I was not in accord, but hey. Also asked him why they were mowing native bunch-grasses— wasn’t the point to be maintenance free and natural? I also suggested he get some bumper stickers printed up: “Support Universal Basic Income”. He was skeptical that Elroy, Jeff, Bill, Sergei would be delighted to start paying taxes to keep humans fed, clothed, warm, dry, and educated, with access to health care and clean potable water. Oh well. Who’s going to the park that the time and money will still be spent maintaining? a parks worker, or a forward deployed engineer? And if “natural”or “wildlife” was ever really the goal for the area, all machines would need to be removed as well. “Desperate Special Forces Bid to Save Pokrovsk Fails as AFU Faces Unprecedented Collapse on Every Front” I have no idea what good the Ukrainians thought that 11 special forces soldiers would do dropped near Pokrovsk. They were quickly wiped out so the whole thing was just a suicide mission. Seems that DC is going to have to get ready for several Ukrainian fortified cities to fall, one after another. I’m sure that Trump will demand an immediate ceasefire and to freeze this war on the contact line and if Russia does not agree, he will do something. But I bet that there will be an element of panic in the air when this happens, not only in DC but also in Brussels. A F U Hmmmm. Irony or paradox? A F U. Irony or Paradox? The fog of war keeps getting thicker. Who knows what their goal was? Extraction? Protecting key assets? A coked out plan to have commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day? A drowning person will grab on to anything they can in their desperation. I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. The AFU will be completely destroyed and any patriotic fighters left standing will join terror groups to make strikes throughout the world. The best guess I’ve read so far is that they were supposed to reach the “sculpted” Pokrovsk city sign at the western entrance to the city, as the helicopter landed less than half a mile away and five of them were killed within a few hundred yards of it. Had they reached it, they could have raised an Ukrainian flag there, take some photos and skedaddle to Dnipro with “solid proof” that Pokrovsk is like totally back under Ukrainian control. It would fit in with the previous high-risk, showy gimmicks Ukrainians tend to do to win the war in social media, but which have little if any effect on the war itself. Perhaps their intent was to surrender with the rest of the guys. That would sure be my goal. commandos raid behind enemy lines and save the day This, my ol’ chap. Yet another one, straight from the UK. Shaken, not stirred. As far as the expectations go, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx9z99YJ_7s&t=50s > I have no idea how the peace will eventually be shaped but the dimensions > of the coming AFU collapse are becoming increasingly clear despite the fog. > The AFU will be completely destroyed … Hei, what’s with the quisling defeatism?!? Why, just yesterday the chairman of Nato’s military committee, one Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, said that >> from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was >> bogged down, and “it was almost time to sit and talk because it’s a waste of lives”. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxng7kxnp9o /sarc That is Monty Python level article, image included.

Nope. It´s mainly political. The real danger of course being how would the Russians react. Although, and I tend to agree, they would act only against targets on Ukrainian territory. Why risk more if the military fallout of Tomahawks would be really limited. Of course if the US wants to start WWIII. They can do that. But the fact that someone at Pentagon – allegedly – greenl-lit it now – doesn´t mean more than just that. Factions vs. factions. Provocation for sake of it due to lack of means and strategy. Russians are well aware of this. Fortunately for us.

I have a crazy notion and, if needed, talk me down. If they can get back to ridicuously easy money policy, they are going to credit “AI” with “productivity gains”. The U.S. joint staff aka pentagon said there are enough tomahawks to send some to Zelenski. Russian staff gets CNN feeds too! What was not said: Japan wants 400 for their missile destroyers, there not being much carrier in missile defense. Also, how to hit anything if U.S. does not provide top secret special access targeting and navigation aids. Those spunky Kievan contracts can get all the engineering specs to do what U.S. wants with tomahawks. Maybe shoot them off MiG 27’s. Are they karting in a ship to launch them from? A 50-foot sailing yacht named Andromeda. Of course! So efficient! From what I’ve seen, there are two batteries in the Army inventory. I assume one of these would be sent in theater. The launcher is housed in a 40-ft container, so an inviting target. I suppose you could park these in the far west by the Poland border to make it a more difficult counter-battery target. Targeting depends on the actual target and desired effect. If it’s a V-1-style terror effect, I suppose it’s possible that inertial nav all the way might be feasible. I would assume GPS denial is something Russia would pursue, at least near high-value targets. Tomahawk can have some onboard nav sensors that would be difficult to block, but depend on prior intel data, which I assume probably exists for any interesting targets. Enroute planning is based the missile RCS (detectability) and low-level flight to take advantage of terrain masking. Again you need intel of the anti-air defense capability. I don’t know, but assume these days actual terrain elevation data is sufficiently available and easily disseminated to shooters that that is no longer a limiting factor. While I suppose “black” programs could be postulated to exist, I continue to doubt the idea that a nuclear warhead option is available for any current missile or launcher. Stock market bubble predictions are becoming, or it’s just my view, seemingly prevalent.

How odd the timing of that news when just a few days ago it was made public that Nigeria is looking to revive state-owned refineries. One refinery of note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_refinery/ And I don’t doubt other global players have lobbied the US to intervene. There has also been a lot of talk about Nigeria (among others) transitioning from SWIFT to CIPS. A shout out to the 12 step groups (Because it is Sunday) who are, to me, the most interesting spiritual phenomenon of the 20th Century. I doubt that there is an adult American who has not lost someone they cared about to addiction, I certainly have. I have also been fortunate enough to have several people I had written off become clean and sober, people who now contribute significantly to their communities. I have read the “Big Book” and although it is better written than the book of mormon or the scientology texts, it is worthy of the Bulwer Lytton award… Happily the program is summarized in two pages, one longer than the summary of “The lazy man’s guide to Enlightenment’. Trump’s Retribution Campaign Leaves D.C. Prosecutor’s Office in Crisis (NY Times via archive.ph) America is a banana republic Under the vaulted arches of the National Union Building, a group of federal prosecutors gathered recently for what has become an all-too-common ritual: saying goodbye to colleagues. The speeches that night reflected the despondent mood inside the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, as the lawyers who were quitting urged those staying behind to forge ahead in uncertain times. Do what’s right, they said. Speak truth to power. Uphold the rule of law. But as the hour grew later — and the bar tab bigger — the politics that have buffeted the office for months suddenly intruded on the evening, people who were there recounted later. In a quiet corner, away from the charcuterie and veggie dip, Jonathan Hornok, a top aide to Jeanine Pirro, the Trump appointee picked to run the office, was firing Jon Hooks, a senior prosecutor who had worked there for nearly 20 years. That a respected supervisor with a long career could be stripped of his job in the middle of a farewell party for his colleagues captured something of the Darwinian tumult that has wracked the prosecutors’ office since President Trump returned to the White House and set about remaking the Justice Department in his image. Bad Jonathan! RE DHS Wants States to Hand Over Driver’s License Data for Citizenship Checks It’s amusing that a kind of national database of Americans, once anathema to conservatives, is being implemented by the Trump administration under the dubious pretense of stopping “voter fraud”. Literally there it is The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship. I imagine Republicans in Congress will pass a bill to outlaw this or conduct investigations any time now… That’s what the state ‘Real ID drivers license’ program is all about. It’s also the prelude to the rollout of official digital IDs. Note: you do not have to have a Real ID drivers license to drive, or even to fly.

(it was well received) of course, the dems are no better. all is contingent and transactional…except that it all must serve the already rich and powerful. Researchers Apply AI To Defend Against Stuxnet-Like Cyber Attacks This is very late to the party. We did exactly this with a French start-up (reverse engineer Siemens PLC’s and do deep packet inspection and AI analysis of packets and traffic to detect anomalies) which we sold to Cisco as the core of their OT (operating technology) division. In 2015-2018. Students in China are encouraged to rest and nap during school. If these various desk designs don’t work out in Chinese schools, maybe blowing and Airbus can pick them up on the cheap and use them in planes. I guarantee they would be a gigantic hit. It’s going to get messy when the Turkeys come home to roost. turkeys…at least the wild-derived ones…are rather fastidious, for barnyard fowl,lol. its the dern ducks that shit everywhere. one morning, unbeknownst to me, there was one roosting on the palapa thing above my barstump…and i’m sitting here drinkin coffee, listening to coyotes, and imagining Evangeline Lilly sitting across from me…and that damned duck just lets one drop, right on my shoulder. and duckshit is pretty nasty,lol. i look up ere i sit down, now. but to your point…it was always gonna come home. down at the bottom where ive lived for most of my life, that was frelling obvious…and has been ongoing…at first, under the aegis of the War on Drugs. the difference between the late 80’s and now, is that the repression, oppression, and all around fascistic jackbootery has been creeping up the class ladder, of late…so more formerly important people are noticing. Gaza is a Method…just like Jakarta. the only question is where lies the bridge too far? we’re obviously not there, yet…too many are still relatively too comfortable to upset the applecart and really resist. but that will come. likely when the Sith are even more well entrenched than they are, now. and i remain a male Cassandra, being dragged out of walmart, crying “Doom!” “Beware Chinese bearing gift cards!” Oftentimes the commentariat is good for a chuckle. Sometimes a bellylaugh. Robotaxis… I’m prosecuted if I mount the sidewalk and mow down a pedestrian. Who faces *any penalty* if a robo-vehicle does that? Here is a very interesting video by Black American content creator Tabitha expanding on her theory that J D Vance will divorce his wife Usha in order to raise his chances of getting elected President. The New Kirx Klan Maga base will not tolerate a Brown Hindu Indian first lady. So Vance needs to get a new wife more to the New Kirx Klan’s MAGA-base’s liking. ” AMERICA FIRST… J.D. Vance Gets A Political Warning From A Leader of Young Republican Men!! ” https://www.youtube.com/live/M3E3t00nXQ4 thats sad as hell,lol. i know nothing about her, but i am an agnostic mystic druidy person, and my wife was catholic…and i supported our boys doing the catholic thing(imagine me in church…after her funeral mass, at the reception/dinner thing in the parish hall(overflow crowds), the Father pointedly sat by me, and we talked about Pseudodionysius,lol…because i am “not contained between my hat and my boots”…i told him that every priest needs a druid friend, and he agreed(!), but hasnt taken me up on it) so i understand multifaith marriage, and how much tolerance and forbearance it takes. thats the sort of example this country needs…and it would be doubly sad to see him cast that away…along with her and their kids…for some short term political calculation. The problem with that theory: Anyone that rabid about interracial marriage would likely not be excited about baby daddy to mixed kids. He can’t divorce the kids. I don’t know if the video talks about that. Don’t really want to watch it. Tabitha is pointing out that J D ” Despicable Little Tatoo” Vance is entirely soul-less, pragmatic and beneath ethics and morality. She therefor predicts that he will divorce his current wife and even try marrying the Widow Kirk if he can. It may not convince GroyperMAGA because of the mixed kids. But Vance will give it a good hard try. The test of a theory is in the coming-true or not of its predictions. If Vance divorces Suha then Tabitha’s theory is pretty good. If he then goes on to marry the Widow Kirk, then her theory is VERY good. Assuming Vance and his wife had a Catholic wedding, Vance would need to have the marriage annulled. Which can be done, but it is complicated. he is not married to his current wife “through the Catholic Church”. i state that categorically, because Tam and I tried, hard…but i would not lie.lol the part of the Catholic Church apparatus that deals with that, to my surprise, is what used to be called the Office of the Inquisition(yeah, that one,lol)…called something else more anodyne, now, that i dont remember. and they are hard core with their check boxes. i was babtise Lutheran, against my will, that wasnt even formed yet,lol…but that part was ok(i was an Xtian, in their eyes)…but i wouldnt submit to professions of Faith…which meant a hard NO!. theres no way in hell that Vance and his Hindu wife were married “through the church”. the Catholic government(what it is) takes their rules seriously. that Priest…Father Melvin…was a nice guy, and he meant well..a kind man, altogether. but he was a clerk…checking off boxes…not a spiritual leader. i found him kind and nice, but boring,lol. his successor out here, Father Red…young guy, inquisitive, well read…is much more inspiring…but also more strict when it comes to the Forms…ie: when he heard her last confession, and administered the Last rights, i had to leave the room…because i wasnt a Catholic. and she wanted me there. bt all that was between her and god, and i was damned to hell, and all. so i wasnt allowed in the temporarily Holy Space. lest i pollute it with my heathenism. Who knows. Maybe he will get ICE Barbie to put bounties on the children. I know a reasonable number of Evangelical Christians and the ones I know are not racists; in fact some of them are themselves Indian (from India) and some are married to Indian people. Vance would have a great advantage among Evangelicals to remain married to Usha, not just because he is supposed to remain married, but also because the question of her possible conversion would be endlessly fascinating to them. Regarding the Tesla robotaxi numbers Elon is spouting this line in the article stood out: “Considering that there are only two months left in the fourth quarter of 2025, Tesla’s Robotaxi team will likely be extremely busy during the next eight weeks.” Curious, I looked up how many are currently in the road: There are ZERO on the road in the Bay Area. https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-is-trying-to-deceive-investors-into-thinking-it-has-san-francisco-robotaxis/ From 0 to 1,000 in eight weeks? Sounds like another one of Elon’s fanciful predictions. Also, according to that article they don’t have a California license for autonomous vehicles but the law isn’t a concern for Elon so doubt that is a concern. A.I. Is Making Death Threats Way More Realistic (NY Times via archive.ph) Even though she was toughened by years spent working in internet activism, Caitlin Roper found herself traumatized by the online threats she received this year. There was the picture of herself hanging from a noose, dead. And another of herself ablaze, screaming. The posts were part of a surge of vitriol directed at Ms. Roper and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group, on X and other social media platforms. Some of it, including images of the women flayed, decapitated or fed into a wood chipper, was seemingly enabled — and given a visceral realism — by generative artificial intelligence. In some of the images, Ms. Roper was wearing a blue floral dress that she does, in fact, own. This year is lit. Trump really is the perfect embodiment of our elite; petty, corrupt, self serving, careless, and entirely focused on immediate gratification. He’s the perfect symbol of a failing state, an empire in terminal decline, entirely unaware even of the limits of power or concerned with the outcomes of its exercise. Well put. I might hazard to add that the corruption is consuming everything and everyone around him. We’re down to M T-G and Massie on the GOP side as the only pols left with anything resembling a soul. Even Rand Paul has become a petty, corrupt little tyrant. He was blathering on about raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 the other day – as if there aren’t a gazillion other real issues out there. I guess kicking old people when they’re down is easier than taking on the MIC, endless wars, genocide, and economic insanity … remember when Rand Paul actually stood up against someone more powerful than him? Remember when his Dad fought to audit the Fed? It’s all a memory now. Other than the immediate gratification bit, that description might serve just as well for Biden, which is appropriate given the Uniparty nature of the late stage empire’s elite Israel’s Zombie Economy Part 3: Israel’s Breakdown Into Tribes – Bassam Haddad Interviews Shir Hever Part 3 of 5 part series by Jadaliyya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJTTm1Ep1mA We are not obsessed with serial killers. The PRESS is obsessed with sensationalism. And only about doing sensationalism with POOR & POWERLESS serial killers. Why? To distract us all from the actual MASS MURDERERS, GENOCIDAL even, that present themselves as “democratic” or “moderate” or “good” people: – Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, Netahyanu, etc. There is not a single POOR & POWERLESS serial killer that reaches even near the kill count of the 5 Hitlers mentioned above. The Press exists to distract and manipulate. The capital/property exists to own the Press. The labour rights DON’T exist in order to facilitate taming actual journalists. The ones that refuse being tamed end up like Assange or the Gaza journalists… This is what “freedom and democracy” really means in the collective West nowadays, and perhaps since always. We all rember that POOR & POWERLESS guy named Jack, the reaper, from London. But the biggest serial killer of them all, in London, are Queen Elizabeth and Winston Churchill, responsible for the provoked famine in colonized Bangladesh, resulting in the GENOCIDE of around 3 million humans. The same press that tells us we “are absessed” with serial killers, doesn’t write a single line about the biggest serial killers of all, who exterminate millions of humans. Because when a serial killer is RICH & POWERFUL, the western “free and democratic” Press calls them “heroes” and “exemplar leaders”… Sorry, there is plenty of evidence to counter your assertion. Mystery novels and movies, which are not press organs, are also fixated with serial killers. See the Academy Award winner Silence of the Lambs as one of many examples. The Hollywood and the Press (aka MSM) are two cheeks of the same behind. Different organs working in concert. Yup. They are obsessed, and we are getting the mushroom treatment. I’m not obsessed with serial killers. Couldn’t care less. My buddy says he’s a cereal killer and a celery stalker. Ukrainian computer game-style drone attack system goes ‘viral’ I’ve been pondering some related things for a while and have some thoughts/predictions: 1. Video games will be used (maybe are already being used) to both train AI and find the best fpv pilots 2. Pro gaming is dominated by teenage boys. Not just because they are the most interested, but because they are the best at them. Once you hit 20 you’re too slow and on the way out. 3. It’s only a matter of time until we see an Ender’s Game scenario, in which teenage boys are recruited and utilised in real-world drone warfare and kill lots of “enemies”. 4.

As a five-time NYC marathon runner myself, I can attest that this race is truly one of the best days of the year. "The energy of marathon day never gets old," Rob Simmelkjaer — the CEO of New York Road Runners, the company behind the marathon — told BI. "It's just a giant block party." The sheer scale of the event — to the tune of $700 million in economic impact for the city — is a reminder of how running is experiencing a golden age. Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan came to the BI office on Thursday and said we're currently in "a running boom," one that's part of the wider health and wellness fixation infiltrating nearly all aspects of society — including the workplace. Running and other forms of exercise are no longer just workouts; they can also serve as social gatherings or even networking events. Companies, for one, are increasingly implementing group runs or fitness classes as a way to promote team building. This is creating a different kind of bonding experience for work colleagues, as opposed to the connections typically made at more traditional happy hours or dinners. My colleague Ana Altchek spoke to several fitness studios that said they've seen a sharp uptick in corporate demand. HIIT studio chain Barry's has experienced a surge in companies booking private classes for employees. Firms are also reserving spots for workers in public classes, or paying to bring instructors to conferences or other events. As for today's marathon, Sheridan of Brooks Running offered some advice. "Keep your head up even when it's hard," he said. Running the marathon is an achievement of one's personal journey: "Just soak that up," he says. In a phone-first world, getting offline is the new social currency. So it's no surprise that social connection apps are having a moment. From concerts to book clubs to dinners with strangers, the apps are about finding friendship as well as love. For many, they're a way to find the ever-shrinking third space, not to replace their online presence altogether. Touching grass hands. When venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig surveyed female startup founders, she didn't ask about sexual harassment on the job. Respondents told her anyway. Of the survey's 180 female founders, eight detailed what they described as harassment, being hit on, or being demeaned by investors while seeking funding. A dark reality. Amazon's massive job cuts this week has the white-collar workforce on edge that they could be next. You can't always control the challenges life throws at you, but you can control how you respond. If you get laid off, you'll likely be in shock, so it's important to take a breath and process. Experts told BI the steps you should take if it happens to you. Three things to keep in mind.

Title: Here's What We Learned From Big Tech Earnings Last Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-is-what-we-learned-from-big-tech-earnings-last-week-11841183
Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."

Title: Satya Nadella says Microsoft will increase headcount following major layoffs, but there is a rider

Following massive job cuts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the tech giant plans to expand its workforce; however, the focus will now be on a more strategic and leveraged approach post-AI revolution. Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner at the B2G podcast that the company’s employee numbers will grow again, but in a “smarter, more leveraged” way. “We will grow our headcount,” Nadella said. “But the way I look at it is, that headcount will grow with a lot more leverage than what we had pre-AI.” Nadella's comments follow the tech company's reported layoffs of nearly 4,000 software engineering roles amid the growing adoption of AI, according to a Bloomberg report. Microsoft plans to cut nearly 6,000 jobs across its divisions, with over 30% of the layoffs based in Washington. In May this year, Satya Nadella addressed the company for the first time after announcing layoffs of roughly 6,000 employees, which account for about three per cent of the global workforce. He highlighted that this decision was part of a wider internal restructuring and did not indicate any issues with employee performance, Mint earlier reported. During a company-wide town hall, Nadella addressed the staff, explaining that the layoffs were essential to realign teams with Microsoft’s shifting priorities, particularly its growing emphasis on artificial intelligence. He recognised the emotional impact of the decision but emphasised that it was motivated by strategic changes rather than issues with productivity or talent. Notably, Microsoft is not the only company that has recently cut jobs. E-commerce giant Amazon earlier confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. The company plans to cut 30,000 jobs in total, Reuters reported. TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google are among the IT and tech companies that have conducted restructuring. IT and technology companies around the world are experiencing significant changes due to ongoing pressure from their US operations and recent worries about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in H-1B visa fees, which could affect new applicants aiming to work in the United States. Besides concerns over the US visa fee hike, jobs in the sector are reportedly at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to use to increase productivity and efficiency rather than relying on the human workforce.

Title: These workers aren't waiting to be laid off — they're building a Plan B

Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in California. He began looking for work immediately but knew it might take a while to land a new role, and he was worried about not being able to earn a paycheck when he had a mortgage to pay. Then he had an idea. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. By temporarily stepping away from work, he thought he might be able to prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role. "I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said. It paid off. Less than a month after returning to work, Permana received a job offer for a software engineering position at MobilityWare, a mobile game developer. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board. Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers. Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job. Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," she said. Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. He was spared, but it was a wake-up call. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made. By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers. After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. Business Insider verified his identity, but he requested to use a pseudonym due to concerns about professional repercussions. After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner," he said, adding, "I don't really have a choice." Not all job jugglers are as ambitious as Reed. Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it. In addition to his part-time gig, John has become less concerned about his job security as he has developed his network over the years. If he were to be laid off from his primary job, he said he knows several startup founders and hiring managers in his industry who he believes would help him find employment. "I'm pretty confident that I'd be able to secure another full-time job in pretty short order," he said. Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs. "I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan," he said. "Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes." When the feared layoff came in July, Ha was already in the middle of a job search. While he's still looking for work, he's glad he got a head start. For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable. Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said Coachman, who's in his 40s and lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. He said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel comfortable doing so. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. A former Microsoft colleague referred him for a role at the AI startup Databricks, which led to an interview — and, in April, a job offer. His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said, adding, "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference." Jump to

Title: The reality of losing a job: Silent redundancies, AI and reentering the jobs market

It’s quick, free and it’s up to you. An account is an optional way to support the work we do. Find out more. THIS WEEK SAW the announcement of jobs at risk on different sides of the market, with hundreds likely to be lost at Amazon and courier firm Fastway. If it feels like this is becoming more common, it’s because it is more common. The figures confirm your thoughts. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office showed a spike of 9.4% in ‘job destructions’ compared to the same period last year. Following the latest announcement of jobs under threat, The Journal asked its readers on whether they had suffered through this over the past year. And in response we heard of the range of emotions experienced after they lost the jobs they had held for years. Some of these roles that were lost were in high-profile multinationals, with difficulties also found upon returning to the jobs market. A certain type of redundancy that has reared its head in recent months is the so-called silent layoff – where a smaller number of jobs are trimmed by a company without fanfare or media attention. The Journal has reported on claims of similar happening at TikTok’s Dublin office for instance. Some of these silent layoffs have been taking place well before this year, but may be getting noticed more due to a perceived tightening of the jobs market. Aidan from Co Offaly worked for a gas supplier for almost 20 years, but suddenly found himself out of a job in a round of cuts. Five people lost their work, this reader recalled: Another person told The Journal that they were recently made redundant from PayPal after over a decade of employment. But the sacking didn’t come as a shock as the reader said the company has been “doing redundancies every 6 months or so for the last 2-3 years. They tend to be in small numbers so it’s not reported a lot”. “Friends of mine from my department were made redundant earlier this year so it wasn’t a huge shock to me but I was still surprised when it happened,” said the reader, who asked to remain anonymous. The blow was cushioned by a redundancy payment: “I won’t mention the amount but it was generous.” Another reader, Cork-based and working in the tech sector, said ‘restructuring’ was the reason for his layoff – and for his lack of shock when it happened. He agreed that the short-to-medium term outlook for other companies means they are either cutting jobs or not looking to hire right now. “In my experience, it’s a challenging market for job seekers. I was a jobseeker in 2018 and 2022 – tougher market in 2025. There are lots of candidates right now for non-specialist tech roles like Project Managers/Program Managers/Product Managers/Recruiters.” A Morgan McKinley report into the Irish labour market detected this same trend. These adjustments are “not immediately visible” in headline figures as they don’t require a formal notification to the Department of Enterprise – and may well help avoid negative headlines. The notifications are supposed to happen if the layoffs meet a certain threshold of a workforce, which is 30 jobs or more at larger employers. What’s driving these silent layoffs? According to Morgan McKinley, it’s most often due to a combination of global economic uncertainty, AI-led transformation and nervousness around US tariffs. AI-led transformation was mentioned by a couple of our readers who had recently lost jobs. One, a translator, said half of his department was made redundant “because they believe in AI translations, although it is not nearly as good, or nearly as precise”. “There was a redundancy package,” he said, but added: “More than the bare minimum, but less than you would expect from an IT company with good revenues and a global brand.” There’s also the not so silent layoffs. Advertisement As with Amazon and Fastway this week, major employers like Oracle have also said they’re reducing their Irish workforce. Another example of this happened to one man working at Intel’s plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare. This reader “drew the short straw” and found himself the only one in his team cut as part of the trimming to the company’s Irish operations. Recent days have marked his last day at the company he joined six years ago via a project management subcontractor. “I was told 4 weeks ago that our department had to be cut by one and I drew the short straw. It absolutely came as a shock because there is a lot of work lined up for next year,” the man said. Earlier this year, Intel announced it was cutting 195 jobs, as it battles to catch up with competitors globally. Soon after a catering company contracted for the plant reduced its headcount by 37 jobs. This man who worked for Intel has to wait to find new work through the project management firm that subcontracts him to sites. However, there has been little success just yet in finding new work. “I’ve been finding it tough the past month since I was told, very few calls or email replies regarding new positions. Leaving Ireland isn’t out of the question but I’ll certainly be leaving Dublin in the near future,” he said. Our reader who lost their job in Paypal said they are yet to begin hunting for a new job, having heard of difficulties from previously laid off friends in their old office. “They haven’t had great luck searching for jobs so far. There doesn’t seem to be many jobs going in our skillset,” this person said. “I don’t feel hopeful that I’ll get a similar job or near to the same salary.” Brian had been working in Dublin as a lecturer in English for international students but lost the job in recent months amid a fall in enrollments. Brian, who received a redundancy package of €4,020, described the search for fresh work as “awful”. “The last time I was out of work (just after Covid) I got lots of replies and interviews,” he said. “While these didn’t always work out, at least there was a responsiveness. That seems to be gone.” Instead, he feels the job search these days is “like AI is talking to itself”. He explained: “I have to use ChatGPT to try to edit my CV so that my skills appear transferable, but I’m 100% certain they are using ChatGPT to filter applications.” It’s almost as if there is a “kind of contempt from prospective employers” that wasn’t there before, the lecturer added. “I don’t just mean not having any response to an application. I’ve had several semi-formal and formal phone calls and online interviews that have had no follow up at all.” John worked for a cryptocurrency firm and has also struggled after being laid off, which couldn’t have been at a worse time given he had just got engaged and bought a house. “As I live several hours from Dublin, I would need something remote or hybrid,” John said. “Finding work has been difficult as the market is very bad right now.” Is leaving Ireland an option for some of our readers? In the main, no. Several of those we spoke to who have found themselves unemployed have been landed in this position after years with the one employer, but at a period of time where they have children or have laid other roots by buying a home. A more hopeful experience was described by Jason from Co Dublin, who found out via a Microsoft Teams meeting that he and dozens more colleagues were being made redundant by their insurance firm. The company was moving the jobs back to the US. “It was not expected so abruptly,” Jason recalled. “We were half way through our house renovation and expecting our fourth child. Losing my job was not in our plans.” After three months spent drawing the dole, he found himself “fortunate enough to be offered a good position within another company within the same industry”.

Title: Amazon’s Lord of the Rings MMO canceled after layoffs as former developer laments ‘Y’all would have loved it'

In unfortunate news for J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth series and MMO fans, Amazon Games’ Lord of the Rings MMO has been quietly canceled after layoffs hit the company’s gaming sector. The cancellation has been confirmed via a now-deleted LinkedIn post (spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun) by former Amazon Games senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine. Ashleigh, who had been with the studio for over nine years, detailed in the LinkedIn post: This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it). It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this. I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve met there. Amazon announced massive corporate layoffs, which hit 14,000 staff members across the company. It’s reported that more employees will be laid off from its 350,000 workforce. Amid the layoffs, Amazon Games’ crew was hit the hardest, with an “undisclosed” number of cuts across its studios in San Diego and Irvine, as well as the central publishing team. The Vice President of Amazon Games confirmed the layoffs in an announcement, stating, “We have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development.” The company is stepping away from the MMO space to focus on casual titles, AI projects, and its cloud gaming platform, Luna. This is the second time Amazon’s Middle-earth MMO project has been canceled. Earlier in 2019, Amazon announced a partnership with Leyou Technologies and Athlon Games Studio. However, the deal was scrapped amid contract discrepancies when Tencent acquired Leyou. Later in 2023, Amazon joined hands with Embracer Group’s Middle-earth Enterprises for publishing rights for the Lord of the Rings MMO. Fans are disappointed upon hearing the loss of what could have been a new take on Tolkien’s universe. Layoffs have also hit Amazon’s New World as active development for the MMO has ended. New World’s Season 10: Nighthaven was the final major content update. Amazon announced that it would keep New World servers online through 2026 and give players 6 months' notice before the servers are sunset. Rock Paper Shotgun

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ says tech giants can’t profit from their astronomical investments unless human labor is replaced

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his warnings about how artificial intelligence will affect the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. Just four so-called AI hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon—are expected to boost capital expenditures to $420 billion next fiscal year from $360 billion this year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI alone has announced a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure deals in recent weeks with AI-ecosystem companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. When asked if such investments can pay off without destroying jobs, Hinton replied, “I believe that it can’t. I believe that to make money you’re going to have to replace human labor.” The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. In fact, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level, and an analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. And this past week, Amazon announced 14,000 layoffs, largely in middle management. While CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was the result of “culture” and not AI, a memo he sent in June predicted a smaller corporate workforce “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Despite the potential downside for workers, Hinton also sees benefits from AI. When asked if he would go back in time and stop AI from developing, he paused and said he doesn’t know. “It’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he explained. “It’s a difficult decision, because it can do tremendous good in health care and education. It’ll do tremendous good, and in fact if you think about it increasing productivity in many, many industries, that should be good.” The problem ultimately is not owing to AI itself, but “on how we organize society,” Hinton added. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

With Amazon, UPS, Target, and Skydance Paramount all announcing layoffs this week, many workers are worried their companies will be next to make cuts. But experts say there are three signs that a round of redundancies is on the horizon — so take note to avoid being blindsided. “Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they’re taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,” Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting, told CNBC. The first sign is “a slowdown in hiring,” recruiter Jalonni Weaver revealed to the website. If new roles don’t get posted, or vacant roles aren’t filled quickly, “it’s never a good sign that you’re doing well financially.” Meanwhile, a change in corporate messaging is the second sign that the company could be looking to let some staffers go. “There’s a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,” consultant Rosie Nestingen told CNBC. Rey Ramirez of Thrive HR Consulting agrees. He advises employees to look out for phrases such as “we need to be more efficient” as a potential sign that the business could boot people in the near future. Thirdly, a reduction in some workers’ hours is another indication that layoffs are looming. “Employees can’t afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,” Ramirez explained, labelling a reduction in hours as effectively “quiet firing.” Other tactics, such as “return to office” mandates, are also deliberately designed to reduce headcount without the company needing to announce official layoffs. Still, it paints a picture of a company that could be mulling cuts in the near future. Amid a sluggish economy and anxiety about AI, Weaver advises all workers to keep their resumes up to date, just in case. Even if you aren’t planning on jumping jobs, the recruiter recommends applying to other roles on occasion in order to make sure your CV and skills at interviews remain “competitive.”
