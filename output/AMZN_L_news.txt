At a time when AI is being cited as the main reason behind layoffs in tech companies, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan revealed that he hired only 2,000 Gen Z graduates from 200,000 applications. He also revealed that if someone asks Gen Z if they are scared about the job market, they say that they are. Brian Moynihan said it is too early to say how AI will play out in the job market.

Title: Databases in 2025: A Year in Review
URL: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html
Time Published: 2026-01-05T07:14:30Z

Another year passes. I was hoping to write more articles instead of just these end-of-the-year screeds, but I almost died in the spring semester, and it sucked up my time. Nevertheless, I will go through what I think are the major trends and happenings in databases over the last year. There were many exciting and unprecedented developments in the world of databases. Vibe coding entered the vernacular. The Wu-Tang Clan announced their time capsule project. Rather than raising one massive funding round this year instead of going public, Databricks raised two massive rounds instead of going public. Meanwhile, other events were expected and less surprising. Redis Ltd. switched their license back one year after their rugpull (I called this shot last year). SurrealDB reported great benchmark numbers because they weren't flushing writes to disk and lost data. And Coldplay can break up your marriage. Astronomer did make some pretty good lemonade on that last one though. With that out of the way, let's do this. These articles are getting longer each year, so I apologize in advance. Previous entries: I first wrote about how PostgreSQL was eating the database world in 2021. That trend continues unabated as most of the most interesting developments in the database world are happening once again with PostgreSQL. The DBMS's latest version (v18) dropped in November 2025. The most prominent feature is the new asynchronous I/O storage subsystem, which will finally put PostgreSQL on the path to dropping its reliance on the OS page cache. It also added support for skip scans; queries can still use multi-key B+Tree indexes even if they are missing the leading keys (i.e., prefix). There are some additional improvements to the query optimizer (e.g., removing superfluous self-joins). Savvy database connoisseurs will be quick to point out that these are not groundbreaking features and that other DBMSs have had them for years. PostgreSQL is the only major DBMS still relying on the OS page cache. And Oracle has supported skip scans since 2002 (v9i)! You may wonder, therefore, why I am claiming that the hottest action in databases for 2025 happened with PostgreSQL? The reason is that most of the database energy and activity is going into PostgreSQL companies, offerings, projects, and derivative systems. In the last year, the hottest data start-up (Databricks) paid $1b for a PostgreSQL DBaaS company (Neon). Next, one of the biggest database companies in the world (Snowflake) paid $250m for another PostgreSQL DBaaS company (CrunchyData). Then, one of the biggest tech companies on the planet (Microsoft) launched a new PostgreSQL DBaaS (HorizonDB). Neon and HorizonDB follow Amazon Aurora's original high-level architecture from the 2010s, with a single primary node separating compute and storage. For now, Snowflake's PostgreSQL DBaaS uses the same core architecture as standard PostgreSQL because they built on Crunchy Bridge. All of the services I listed above are single-primary node architectures. That is, applications send writes to a primary node, which then sends those changes to secondary replicas. But in 2025, there were two announcements on new projects to create scale-out (i.e., horizontal partitioning) services for PostgreSQL. In June 2025, Supabase announced that it had hired Sugu, the Vitess co-creator and former PlanetScale co-founder/CTO, to lead the Multigres project to create sharding middleware for PostgreSQL, similar to how Vitess shards MySQL. Sugu left PlanetScale in 2023 and had to lie back in the cut for two years. He is now likely clear of any legal issues and can make things happen at Supabase. You know it is a big deal when a database engineer joins a company, and the announcement focuses more on the person than the system. The co-founder/CTO of SingleStore joined Microsoft in 2024 to lead HorizonDB, but Microsoft (incorrectly) did not make a big deal about it. Sugu joining Supabase is like Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP) getting out on parole after two years and then announcing a new record deal on the first day of his release. One month after the Multigres news dropped, PlanetScale announced its own Vitess-for-PostgreSQL project, Neki. PlanetScale launched its initial PostgreSQL DBaaS in March 2025, but the core architecture is single-node stock PostgreSQL with pgBouncer. With Microsoft's introduction of HorizonDB in 2025, all major cloud vendors now have serious projects for their own PostgreSQL offerings. Amazon has offered Aurora PostgreSQL since 2017. Google put out AlloyDB in 2022. ServiceNow launched its RaptorDB service in 2024, based on its 2021 acquisition of Swarm64. Even the old flip-phone IBM has had its cloud version of PostgreSQL since 2018. Oracle released its PostgreSQL service in 2023, though there is a rumor that its in-house PostgreSQL team was collateral damage in its MySQL OCI layoffs in September 2025. There are still a few independent (ISV) PostgreSQL DBaaS companies. Supabase is likely the largest of these by the number of instances. Others include YugabyteDB, TigerData (nÃ©e TimeScale), PlanetScale, Xata, PgEdge, and Nile. Xata built its original architecture on Amazon Aurora, but this year, it announced it is switching to its own infrastructure. ParadeDB has yet to announce its hosted service. Tembo dropped its hosted PostgreSQL offering in 2025 to pivot to a coding agent that can do some database tuning. Hydra and PostgresML went bust in 2025 (see Deaths section), so they're out of the game. Other systems provide a Postgres-compatible front-end, but the back-end systems are not derived from PostgreSQL (e.g., CockroachDB, CedarDB, Google Spanner). There are also hosting companies that offer PostgreSQL DBaaS alongside other systems, such as Aiven and Tessel. It is not clear who the next major buyer will be after Databricks and Snowflake bought PostgreSQL companies. Again, every major tech company already has a Postgres offering. EnterpriseDB is the oldest PostgreSQL ISV, but missed out on the two most significant PostgreSQL acquisitions in the last five years. But they can ride Bain Capital's jock for a while, or hope that HPE buys them even though that partnership is from eight years ago. The PostgreSQL M&A playfield is reminiscent of OLAP acquisitions in the late 2000s, when Vertica was the last one waiting at the bus stop after AsterData, Greenplum, and DATAllegro were acquired. The development of the two three competing distributed PostgreSQL projects (Multigres, Neki, PgDog) is welcome news. These projects are not the first time somebody has attempted this: Greenplum, ParAccel, and Citus have been around for two decades for OLAP workloads. Citus supports OLTP workloads, but they started in 2010 focused on analytics. For OLTP, 15 years ago, the NTT RiTaDB project joined forces with GridSQL to create Postgres-XC. Developers from Postgres-XC founded StormDB, which Translattice later acquired in 2013. Postgres-X2 was an attempt to modernize XC, but the developers abandoned that effort. Translattice open-sourced StormDB as Postgres-XL, but the project has been dormant since 2018. YugabyteDB came out in 2016 and is probably the most widely deployed sharded PostgreSQL system (and remains open-source!), but it is a hard fork, so it is only compatible with PostgreSQL v15. Amazon announced its own sharded PostgreSQL (Aurora Limitless) in 2024, but it is closed source. I know Microsoft bought Citus in 2019 but it is hard to keep track of what they were doing before HorizonDB because of their confusing product names. Citus was rebranded as Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale in 2019 and was then renamed to Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL in 2022. But then there is Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Elastic Clusters that also uses Citus, but it is not the same as the Citus-powered Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. Microsoft discontinued Azure PostgreSQL Single Server in 2023, but kept Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server. That is a lot of Azure this and Azure that. It is sort of like how Amazon could not resist adding "Aurora" to DSQL's name. Either way, at least Microsoft was smart enough to keep the name for their new system to just "Azure HorizonDB" (for now). The PlanetScale squad has no love for the other side and is known to throw hands at Neon and Timescale. Database companies popping off at each other is nothing new (see Yugabyte vs. CockroachDB or Databricks vs. Snowflake). I suspect we will see more of this in the future as the PostgreSQL wars heat up. I suggest that these smaller companies call out the big cloud vendors and keep each other's name out of their mouths. If 2023 was the year every DBMS added a vector index, then 2025 was the year that every DBMS added support for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is a standardized client-server JSON-RPC interface that lets LLMS interact with external tools and data sources without requiring custom glue code. An MCP server acts as middleware in front of a DBMS and exposes a listing of tools, data, and actions it provides. An MCP client (e.g., an LLM host such as Claude or ChatGPT) discovers and uses these tools to extend its models' capabilities by sending requests to the server. In the case of databases, the MCP server converts these queries into the appropriate database query (e.g., SQL) or administrative command. In other words, MCP is the middleman who keeps the bricks counted and the cream straight, so the database and LLMs trust each other enough to do business. Anthropic announced MCP in November 2024, but it really took off in March 2025 when OpenAI announced it would support MCP in its ecosystem. Over the next few months, every DBMS vendor released MCP servers for all system categories: OLAP (e.g., ClickHouse, Snowflake, Firebolt, Yellowbrick), SQL (e.g., YugabyteDB, Oracle, PlanetScale), and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis). Since there is no official Postgres MCP server, every Postgres DBaaS has released its own (e.g., Timescale, Supabase, Xata). The cloud vendors released multi-database MCP servers that can talk to any of their managed database services (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Allowing a single gateway to talk to heterogeneous databases is almost, but not quite, a holy-grail federated database. As far as I know, each request in these MCP servers targets only a single database at a time, so the application is responsible for performing joins across sources. Beyond the official vendor MCP implementations, there are hundreds of rando MCP server implementations for nearly every DBMS. Some of them attempt to support multiple systems (e.g., DBHub, DB MCP Server). DBHub put out a good overview of PostgreSQL MCP servers. An interesting feature that has proven helpful for agents is database branching. Although not specific to MCP servers, branching allows agents to test database changes quickly without affecting production applications. Neon reported in July 2025 that agents create 80% of their databases. Neon was designed from the beginning to support branching (Nikita showed me an early demo when the system was still called "Zenith"), whereas other systems have added branching support later. See Xata's recent comparison article on database branching. On one hand, I'm happy that there is now a standard for exposing databases to more applications. But nobody should trust an application with unfettered database access, whether it is via MCP or the system's regular API. And it remains good practice only to grant minimal privileges to accounts. Restricting accounts is especially important with unmonitored agents that may start going wild all up in your database. This means that lazy practices like giving admin privileges to every account or using the same account for every service are going to get wrecked when the LLM starts popping off. Of course, if your company leaves its database open to the world while you cause the stock price of one of the wealthiest companies to drop by $600b, then rogue MCP requests are not your top concern. From my cursory examination of a few MCP server implementations, they are simple proxies that translate the MCP JSON requests into database queries. There is no deep introspection to understand what the request aims to do and whether it is appropriate. Somebody is going to try to order 18,000 water cups in your application, and you need to make sure it doesn't crash your database. Some MCP servers have basic protection mechanisms (e.g., ClickHouse only allows read-only queries). DBHub provides a few additional protections, such as capping the number of returned records per request and implementing query timeouts. Supabase's documentation offers best-practice guidelines for MCP agents, but they rely on humans to follow them. And of course, if you rely on humans to do the right thing, bad things will happen. Enterprise DBMSs already have automated guardrails and other safety mechanisms that open-source systems lack, and thus, they are better prepared for an agentic ecosystem. For example, IBM Guardium and Oracle Database Firewall identify and block anomalous queries. I am not trying to shill for these big tech companies. I know we will see more examples in the future of agents ruining lives, like accidentally dropping databases. Combining MCP servers with proxies (e.g., connection pooling) is an excellent opportunity to introduce automated protection mechanisms. MongoDB has been the NoSQL stalwart for two decades now. FerretDB was launched in 2021 by Percona's top brass to provide a middleware proxy that converts MongoDB queries into SQL for a PostgreSQL backend. This proxy allows MongoDB applications to switch over to PostgreSQL without rewriting queries. They coexisted for a few years before MongoDB sent FerretDB a cease-and-desist letter in 2023, alleging that FerretDB infringes MongoDB's patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and that it violates MongoDB's license for its documentation and wire protocol specification. This letter became public in May 2025 when MongoDB went nuclear on FerretDB by filing a federal lawsuit over these issues. Part of their beef is that FerretDB is out on the street, claiming they have a "drop-in replacement" for MongoDB without authorization. MongoDB's court filing has all the standard complaints about (1) misleading developers, (2) diluting trademarks, and (3) damaging their reputation. The story is further complicated by Microsoft's announcement that it donated its MongoDB-compatible DocumentDB to the Linux Foundation. The project website mentions that DocumentDB is compatible with the MongoDB drivers and that it aims to "build a MongoDB compatible open source document database". Other major database vendors, such as Amazon and Yugabyte, are also involved in the project. From a cursory glance, this language seems similar to what MongoDB is accusing FerretDB of doing. I could not find an example of a database company suing another one for replicating their API. The closest is Oracle suing Google for using a clean-room copy of the Java API in Android. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Google on fair use grounds, and the case affected how re-implementation is treated legally. I don't know how the lawsuit will play out if it ever goes to trial. A jury of random people off the street may not be able to comprehend the specifics of MongoDB's wire protocol, but they are definitely going to understand that the original name of FerretDB was MangoDB. It is going to be challenging to convince a jury that you were not trying to divert customers when you changed one letter in the other company's name. Never mind that it is not even an original name: there is already a parody DBMS called MangoDB that writes everything to /dev/null as a joke. And while we are on the topic of database system naming, Microsoft's choice of "DocumentDB" is unfortunate. There are already Amazon DocumentDB (which, by the way, is also compatible with MongoDB, but Amazon probably pays for that), InterSystems DocDB, and Yugabyte DocDB. Microsoft's original name for "Cosmos DB" was also DocumentDB back in 2016. Lastly, MongoDB's court filing claims they "pioneered the development of 'non-relational' databases". This statement is incorrect. The first general-purpose DBMSs were non-relational because the relational model had not yet been invented. General Electric's Integrated Data Store (1964) used a network data model, and IBM's Information Management System (1966) used a hierarchical data model. MongoDB is also not the first document DBMS. That title goes to the object-oriented DBMSs from the late 1980s (e.g., Versant) or the XML DBMSs from the 2000s (e.g., MarkLogic). MongoDB is the most successful of these approaches by a massive margin (except maybe IMS). File formats are an area of data systems that have been mostly dormant for the last decade. In 2011, Meta released a column-oriented format for Hadoop called RCFile. Two years later, Meta refined RCFile and announced the PAX-based ORC (Optimized Record Columnar File) format. A month after ORC's release, Twitter and Cloudera released the first version of Parquet. Nearly 15 years later, Parquet is the dominant file open-source format. In 2025, there were five new open-source file formats released vying to dethrone Parquet: These new formats joined the other formats released in 2024: SpiralDB made the biggest splash this year with their announcement of donating Vortex to the Linux Foundation and the establishment of their multi-organization steering committee. Microsoft quietly killed off Amudai (or at least closed sourced it) at some point at the end of 2025. The other projects (FastLanes, F3, Anyblox) are academic prototypes. Anyblox won the VLDB Best Paper award this year. This fresh competition has lit a fire in the Parquet developer community to modernize its features. See this in-depth technical analysis of the columnar file format landscape by Parquet PMC Chair (Julien Le Dem). The main problem with Parquet is not inherent in the format itself. The specification can and has evolved. Nobody expected organizations to rewrite petabytes of legacy files to update them to the latest Parquet version. The problem is that there are so many implementations of reader/writer libraries in different languages, each supporting a distinct subset of the specification. Our analysis of Parquet files in the wild found that 94% of them use only v1 features from 2013, even though their creation timestamps are after 2020. This lowest common denominator means that if someone creates a Parquet file using v2 features, it is unclear whether a system will have the correct version to read it. I worked on the F3 file format with brilliant people at Tsinghua (Xinyu Zeng, Ruijun Meng, Huanchen Zhang), CMU (Martin Prammer, Jignesh Patel), and Wes McKinney. Our focus is on solving this interoperability problem by providing both native decoders as shared objects (Rust crates) and embedded WASM versions of those decoders in the file. If somebody creates a new encoding and the DBMS does not have a native implementation, it can still read data using the WASM version by passing Arrow buffers. Each decoder targets a single column, allowing a DBMS to use a mix of native and WASM decoders for a single file. AnyBlox takes a different approach, generating a single WASM program to decode the entire file. I don't know who will win the file format war. The next battle is likely to be over GPU support. SpiralDB seems to be making the right moves, but Parquet's ubiquity will be challenging to overcome. I also didn't even discuss how DuckLake seeks to upend Iceberg... Of course, when this topic comes up, somebody always posts this xkcd comic on competing standards. I've seen it before. You don't need to email it to me again. Databases are big money. Let's go through them all! Lots of movement on the block. Pinecone replaced its CEO in September to prepare for an acquisition, but I have not heard anything else about it. Here are the ones that did happen: The Cassandra stalwart got picked up by IBM at the beginning of the year for an estimated $3b. The leading company behind the Lucene replacement, Tantivy, a full-text search engine, was acquired at the beginning of the year. The good news is that Tantivy development continues unabated. This acquisition was a solid pick-up for dbt as part of their Fusion announcement this year. It allows them to perform more rigorous SQL analysis in their DAGs. Mongo picked up an early-stage AI company to expand its RAG capabilities in its cloud offering. One of my best students joined Voyage one week before the announcement. He thought he was going against the "family" by not signing with a database company, only to end up at one. Apparently, there was a bidding war for this PostgreSQL company, but Databricks paid a mouthwatering $1b for it. Neon still exists today as a standalone service, but Databricks quickly rebranded it in its ecosystem as Lakebase. You know Snowflake could not let Databricks get all the excitement during the summer, so they paid $250m for the 13-year-old PostgreSQL company CrunchyData. Crunchy had picked up top ex-Citus talent in recent years and was expanding its DBaaS offering before Snowflake wrote them a check. Snowflake announced the public preview of its Postgres service in December 2025. The 1990s old-school ETL company Informatica got picked up by Salesforce for $8b. This is after they went public in 1999, reverted to PE in 2015, and went public again in 2021. To be honest, I never understood how Couchbase went public in 2021. I guess they were riding on MongoDB's coattails? Couchbase did interesting work a few years ago by incorporating components from the AsterixDB project at UC Irvine. Tecton provides Databricks with additional tooling to build agents. Another one of my former students was at the company and is now at Databricks. This team is behind two useful tools: SQLMesh and SQLglot. The former is the only viable open-source contender to dbt (see below for their pending merger with Fivetran). SQLglot is a handy SQL parser/deparser that supports a heuristic-based query optimizer. The combination of this in Fivetran and SDF with dbt makes for an interesting technology play in this space in the coming years. The PE firm buying SingleStore (Vector Capital) has prior experience in managing a database company. They previously purchased the XML database company MarkLogic in 2020 and flipped it to Progress in 2023. After getting bought by PE in 2024, the MariaDB Corporation went on a buying spree this year. The first up is the company behind the Galera Cluster scale-out middleware for MariaDB. See my 2023 overview of the MariaDB dumpster fire. And then we have the second MariaDB acquisition. Just so everyone is clear, the original commercial company backing MariaDB was called "SkySQL Corporation" in 2010, but it changed its name to "MariaDB Corporation" in 2014. Then in 2020, the MariaDB Corporation released a MariaDB DBaaS called SkySQL. But because they were hemorrhaging cash, the MariaDB Corporation spun SkySQL Inc. out as an independent company in 2023. And now, in 2025, MariaDB Corporation has come full circle by buying back SkySQL Inc. I did not have this move on my database bingo card this year. The automated database optimization tool company heads off to Temporal to automatically optimize their databases! I'm happy to hear that Crystal's founder and Berkeley database group alumnus Johann Schleier-Smith is doing well there. This system (formerly OmniSci, formerly MapD) was one of the first GPU-accelerated databases, launched in 2013. I couldn't find an official announcement of their closing, aside from an M&A firm listing the successful deal. And then we had a meeting with Nvidia to discuss potential database research collaborations, and some HeavyDB friends showed up. Dgraph was previously acquired by Hypermode in 2023. It looks like Istari just bought Dgraph and not the rest of Hypermode (or they ditched it). I still haven't met anybody who is actively using Dgraph. This was one of the first "chat with your database" out of the University of Wisconsin and now CMU-DB professor Jignesh Patel. But they were bought by a European hotel management SaaS. Take that to mean what you think it means. Datometry has been working on the perilous problem of automatically converting legacy SQL dialects (e.g., Teradata) to newer OLAP systems for several years. Snowflake picked them up to expand their migration tooling. See Datometry's 2020 CMU-DB tech talk for more info. Like Snowflake buying Datometry, ClickHouse's acquisition here is a good example of improving the developer experience for high-performance commodity OLAP engines. After buying Neon, Databricks bought Mooncake to enable PostgreSQL to read/write to Apache Iceberg data. See their November 2025 CMU-DB talk for more info. This is the archetype of how to make a company out of a grassroots open-source project. Kafka was originally developed at Linkedin in 2011. Confluent was then spun out as a separate startup in 2014. They went IPO seven years later in 2021. Then IBM wrote a big check to take it over. Like with DataStax, it remains to be seen whether IBM will do to Confluent what IBM normally does with acquired companies, or whether they will be able to remain autonomous like RedHat. Formerly EdgeDB, they provided DSL on top of PostgreSQL that got picked up by Verel at the end of the year. The embedded graph DBMS out of the University of Waterloo was acquired by an unnamed company in 2025. The KuzuDB company then announced it was abandoning the open-source project. The LadybugDB project is an attempt at maintaining a fork of the Kuzu code. Unexpected news dropped in October 2025 when Fivetran and dbt Labs announced they were merging to form a single company. The last merger I can think of in the database space was the 2019 merger between Cloudera and Hortonworks. But that deal was just weak keys getting stepped on in a kitchen: two companies that were struggling to find market relevance with Hadoop merged into a single company to try to find it (spoiler: they did not). The MariaDB Corporation merger with Angel Pond Holdings Corporation in 2022 via a SPAC technically counts too, but that deal was so MariaDB could backdoor their way to IPO. And it didn't end well for investors. The Fivetran + dbt merger is different (and better) than these two. They are two complementary technology companies combining to become an ETL juggernaut, preparing for a legit IPO in the near future. Unless I missed them or they weren't announced, there were not as many early-stage funding rounds for database startups. The buzz around vector databases has muted, and VCs are only writing checks for LLM companies. A new category in my yearly write-up is database companies changing the name of their company or system. The JSON database company dropped the "DB" suffix from its name to emphasize its positioning as a platform for database-backed applications, similar to Convex and Heroku. I like the Harper people. Their 2021 CMU-DB tech talk presented the worst DBMS idea I have ever heard. Thankfully, they ditched that once they realized how bad it was and switched to LMDB. This was a smart move because the name "Edge" conveys that it is a database for edge devices or services (e.g., Fly.io). But I'm not sure "Gel" conveys the project's higher-level goals. See their 2025 CMU-DB talk on Gel's query language (still called EdgeQL) from a CMU Ph.D. alum. This is a rare occurrence of a database company renaming itself to distinguish itself from its main database product. It is usually companies renaming themselves to be the name of the database (e.g., "Relational Software, Inc." to "Oracle Systems Corporation", "10gen, Inc." to "MongoDB, Inc."). But it makes sense for the company to try to shed the perception of being a specialized time-series DBMS instead of an improved version of PostgreSQL for general applications, since the former is a much smaller market segment than the latter. In full disclosure, I was a technical advisor for two of these failed startups. My success rate as an advisor is terrible at this point. I was also an advisor for Splice Machine, but they closed shop in 2021. In my defense, I only talk with these companies about technical ideas, not business strategies. And I did tell Fauna they should add SQL support, but they did not take my advice. An interesting distributed DBMS based on Dan Abadi's research for deterministic concurrency control. They provided strongly consistent transactions right when the NoSQL fade was waning, and Spanner made transactions cool again. But they had a proprietary query language and made big bets on GraphQL. The idea seemed obvious: enable people to run ML/AI operations inside of their PostgreSQL DBMS. The challenge was to convince people to migrate their existing databases to their hosted platform. They were pushing pgCat as a proxy to mirror database traffic. One of the co-founders joined Anthropic. The other co-founder created a new proxy project called pgDog. This is one of the first DBMSs written in Java, dating back to 1997 (originally called "Java DB" or "JBMS"). IBM donated it to the Apache Foundation in the 2000s, and it was renamed as Derby. In October 2025, the project announced that the system would enter "read-only mode" because no one was actively maintaining it anymore. Although there is no official announcement for the DuckDB-inside-Postgres startup, the co-founders and employees have scattered to other companies. This was a fork of Clickhouse that adds vector search and full-text indexing using Tantivy. They announced they were closing in May 2025. This was supposed to be the supergroup of database companies. Think of it like having Run the Jewels team of heavy hitters. You had top engineers from Nvidia Rapids, the inventor of Apache Arrow and Python Pandas, and the Peruvian GPU wizards from BlazingSQL. Then throw in $110m in VC money from top firms that included the future CEO of Intel (and a board of trustee member at CMU). They built a GPU-accelerated database (Theseus), but failed to launch it in a timely manner. Lastly, although not a business, I would be remiss not to mention the closing of IBM Research Almaden. IBM built this site in 1986 and was the database research mecca for decades. I interviewed at Almaden in 2013 and found the scenery to be beautiful. The IBM Research Database Group is not what it used to be. Still, the alum list of this hallowed database ground is impressive: Rakesh Agrawal, Donald Chamberlin, Ronald Fagin, Laura Haas, Mohan, Pat Selinger, Moshe Vardi, Jennifer Widom, and Guy Lohman. Somebody claimed that I judge the quality of a database based on how much funding the backing company raises for its development. This is obviously not true. I track these happenings because the database research game is crowded and high-energy. Not only am I "competing" against academics at other universities, but big tech companies and small start-ups are also putting out interesting systems I need to follow. The industry research labs are not what they used to be, except for Microsoft Research, which is still aggressively hiring top people and doing incredible work. I predicted in 2022 that there would be a large number of database company closings in 2025. Yes, there were more closings this year than in previous years, but not at the scale I expected. The death of Voltron and sort-of acquihire of HeavyDB seem to continue the trend of the inviability of GPU-accelerated databases. Kinetica has been milking government contracts for years, and Sqream still appears to be kicking it. These companies are still niche, and nobody has been able to make a significant dent in the dominance of CPU-powered DBMSs. I can't say who or what, but you will hear some major GPU-accelerated database announcements by vendors in 2026. It also provides further evidence of the commoditization of OLAP engines; modern systems have gotten so fast that the performance between them is negligible for low-level operations (scans, joins), so the things that differentiate one system from another are user experience and the quality of the query plans their optimizers generate. The Couchbase and SingleStore acquisitions by private equity (PE) firms might signal a future trend in the database industry. Of course, PE acquisitions have happened before, but they all seem to be in recent times: (1) MarkLogic in 2020, (2) Cloudera in 2021, and (3) MariaDB in 2023. The only ones I can find before 2020 were SolidDB in 2007 and Informatica in 2015. PE acquisitions might replace the trend of plateaued database companies being bought by holding companies that milk the maintenance fees until eternity (Actian, Rocket). Even Oracle is still making money off RDB/VMS after buying them 30 years ago! Lastly, props to Nikita Shamgunov. As far as I know, he is the only person to have co-founded two database companies (SingleStore and Neon) that were both acquired in a single year. Like when DMX (RIP) released two #1 albums in a single year (It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, Flesh of My Flesh), I don't think anybody is going to break Nikita's record any time soon. Talk about a banner year for the database OG Larry Ellison. The man turned 81 and accomplished more in one year than most people do in their lifetime. I will cover it all in chronological order. Larry started the year ranked third-richest in the world. The idea that he would be worth less than Mark Zuckerberg was keeping him up at night. Some were saying Larry's insomnia was due to a diet change after he bought a famous British pub and was eating more pies. But I assure you that Larry's "veg-aquarian" diet has not changed in 30 years. Then, in April 2025, we got the news that Larry had become the second-richest person in the world. He started sleeping a little better, but it still wasn't good enough. There was also still a lot going on in his life that was stressing him out. For example, Larry finally decided to sell his rare, semi-road-legal McLaren F1 supercar, complete with the original owner's manual in the glovebox. In July 2025, Larry graced us with this third tweet in 13 years (known as "#3" by Larry aficionados such as myself). This was an update about the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT) that Larry established near the University of Oxford. With the name EIT and its association with Oxford, it sounds like it would be a pure research, non-profit institution, similar to Stanford's SRI or CMU's SEI. But it turns out to be an umbrella organization for a series of for-profit companies owned by a California-based limited liability company. Of course, a bunch of weirdos replied to #3 with promises of blockchain-powered cryogenic freezing or room-temperature superconductors. Larry told me he ignores those. Then there are people like this guy who get it. The biggest database news of the year (possibly the century) hit us on Wednesday, September 10th, at approximately 3:00pm EST. After waiting for his turn for decades, Larry Joseph Ellison was finally anointed the richest person in the world. $ORCL shares rose by 40% that morning, and since Larry still owns 40% of the company, his estimated total worth is $393b. To put this in perspective, this not only made Larry the wealthiest person in the world, but also the richest person in the entire history of humanity. The peak net worths, adjusted for inflation, of John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie (yes, the 'C' in CMU) were only $340b and $310b, respectively. On top of Larry's ascension to the top of the world, Oracle was also involved in the acquisition of the U.S. company controlling TikTok and Larry bankrolling Paramount (controlled by his son from his fourth marriage) bid to take over Warner Bros. The U.S. president even chided Larry to take control of CNN's news division since Larry is the majority shareholder of Paramount. I don't even know where to begin. Of course, when I found out that Larry Ellison had become the richest person in the world, all thanks to databases, I was heartened that something positive had finally happened in our lives. I don't care that Oracle's stock was artificially pumped up by splashy deals to build AI data centers instead of its traditional software business. I don't care that he dropped down the rankings after personally losing $130b in two months. That's like you and me blowing a paycheck on FortuneCoins. It stings a little, and we had to eat rice and beans for two weeks mixed with expired hot sauce packets we took from Taco Bell, but we'll be alright. Some people claim that Larry is out of touch with ordinary people. Or that he has lost his way because he is involved in things not directly related to databases. They point to things like his Hawaiian robot farm selling lettuce at $24/pound (â¬41/kg). Or that 81-year-old men don't have naturally blonde hair. The truth is that Larry Ellison has conquered the enterprise database world, competitive sailing, and techbro wellness spas. The obvious next step is to take over a cable TV channel watched by thousands of people waiting in airports every day. Every time I talk with Larry, he makes it clear that he does not care one bit what people say or think about him. He knows his fans love him. His (new) wife loves him. And in the end, that's all that matters. Before we close, I want to give some quick shout outs and words of advice. First is to PT for keeping their database game tight with Turso in lockdown (see you on the outside). Condolences to JT for losing their job for trapping their KevoDB database sidepiece. And be sure to only put in fake data in your database for testing and not to sell it for $175m only to end up getting a seven year bid. My Ph.D. students and I also have a new start-up. I hope to say more on that soon. Word is bond.

Title: Inside Saks Fifth Avenue's fight for its life: How a tumultuous 12 months left the retailer on the brink of bankruptcy

From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display. The shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. What happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future. In early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually. Hilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.

"They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season," Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. "Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do." Saks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk. "Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future," a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. "Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it." To succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises. As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. "They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view." Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. 2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks. For more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan. Its problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors. Then, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems. "It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred," Wassner said. "Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems." But the execution was messy. The deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called "unsustainable." It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow). One of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick. He told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer. Vendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place. One vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation "agony." "We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making," the person said. "That just did not happen." Brands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best. Those who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met. That month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors. "I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going," the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said. In the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory. S&P analysts wrote that Saks had a "less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position." In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges. "You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from," Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. "You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best." Some brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks. Skincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August. In October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by "Real Housewives of New York" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.) By the end of the year, murmurs of a potential bankruptcy filing made headlines. They intensified on the last day of the year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saks had missed a nine-figure interest payment, according to people familiar with it. "It's time to solve the problems one way or another," Wassner said. Bankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience. Cohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead. "They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession," he said. "Is there sunshine here? I don't think so." Kaja Whitehouse contributed reporting to this article. Jump to

Title: Big Tech turned me down. At Walmart, I found a career opportunity, work-life balance, and good food.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kanish Shah, a 26-year-old software engineer at Walmart who lives in Milpitas, California. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I moved to the US from India in August 2021 to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California. Soon after, I began looking for a summer internship — but things didn't go as planned. Like many aspiring software engineers, I was excited about the idea of working at a Big Tech company like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, or Netflix. I targeted those tech giants during my internship search, but the competition was intense. I ended up being rejected by all of them, which was disappointing. It wasn't just the tech giants that turned me down. I ended up applying to hundreds of internships and received fewer than 15 callbacks — one of which turned into a role at Walmart. I learned that Big Tech isn't the only route to take for a successful tech career. While I struggled to gain traction with tech giants, I eventually secured interviews with several startups and midsize companies.

One of the internships I applied to early on — without a referral — was a software engineering role at Walmart. A couple of months later, around October 2021, a recruiter reached out about an online assessment followed by two technical interviews. I received an offer soon after the interviews and started the internship in May. I treated the internship like an extended interview — I asked for weekly feedback, stayed vocal during meetings, and found a mentor. I believe that approach helped me secure a full-time software engineering role with Walmart, which I started in June 2023. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year.

Read more on the topic: When I joined Walmart full-time, the company was in the midst of a major transformation — evolving from a traditional retail giant into a tech-driven, AI-powered organization. It felt like an opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological change while accelerating my own learning. That was a significant reason I decided to stay after my internship. I'm very happy with my decision. In addition to growing as a software engineer, I've found that the work culture and work-life balance at Walmart are really great. My hours can vary, but I generally work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have time to spend with family and friends on the weekends. I live in Milpitas, California, about a 25-minute commute from Walmart's Sunnyvale office. I'm required to go in two days a week, though in-office expectations vary across teams. The office itself is great. It has a lot of amenities, including boxing and pilates classes, a basketball court, a large gym, and good food. Walmart offers a wide range of cuisine options in its cafeteria. For lunch, I usually opt for the "make your own salad bowl," but there are also options featuring Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes. The food isn't free, but it's subsidized, so it's not costly — and drinks like fountain beverages, tea, and coffee are complimentary. At a traditional Big Tech company, you may find early exposure to systems operating at a massive global scale — along with access to specialized internal tooling, research teams, and long-established engineering playbooks. There's also the brand recognition, which could make future job mobility feel more straightforward. That said, those differences haven't felt like gaps for me. I haven't felt that I'm missing out on meaningful learning or career development where I am. For me, the quality of work, mentorship, and ownership has mattered more than the logo. My advice to other young tech professionals is this: aiming for Big Tech is completely valid — those roles can be great aspirations. However, not landing one of these roles shouldn't be too discouraging. High-impact work can be found in many environments, including startups and emerging tech companies. I also believe that strong compensation is possible outside traditional Big Tech — my compensation is in the six figures. From a job security perspective, I believe the entire tech industry has undergone a period of recalibration over the past couple of years. Layoffs have affected companies of all sizes — including Big Tech, midsize firms, and even large enterprises like Walmart. So I try not to view job security as something tied to a single company or sector. What gives me confidence is focusing on the factors I can control: continuously building relevant skills, staying adaptable, and making a meaningful impact in my role. In short, my advice would be not to limit yourself to a narrow set of companies. Stay open to opportunities where you can learn, contribute, and grow — because the tech world is much bigger than just one path. Jump to

Title: Unemployment in Berkshire County rises to four-year high as job growth slows

Reporter Nursing students at Berkshire Community College use a simulator to stabilize a computer-controlled patient in 2022. Local workforce experts say there is a growing gap between the health care industry's needs and finding skilled workers. Training programs, like the one at BCC, are working to fill that need. Berkshire County’s unemployment rate climbed to 4 percent in September, the highest level the region has seen in four years. But even as unemployment rises, the labor market remains tight. Local employers are grappling with skill shortages, AI-driven hiring changes and evolving worker expectations — trends reflected across the U.S. as job growth slows and companies become more cautious. “We have had some layoffs in the area, but we are not seeing a big uptick in candidates coming in the door looking for work, so that’s kind of interesting,” said Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield. Maricelli Serrano of MassHire meets job applicants at a job fair in 2019. The MassHire Berkshire Career Center is a partnership between the Berkshire Training & Employment Program and the Massachusetts Division of Career Services. National job growth has also slowed in recent months. Federal data showed job losses in October followed by modest gains in November, pushing the national unemployment rate to 4.6 percent — its highest level since 2021. Tariffs, increases in wages and the impact of AI have stalled hiring momentum as companies like Amazon, Verizon, UPS and General Motors have announced job cuts. After 5 percent growth from 2019 to 2024, job growth slowed in 2025, said Heather Boulger, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Workforce Board, a local organization that helps people find jobs. In September, 63,812 people were in the Berkshire County labor force, with 61,260 employed and 2,552 collecting unemployment insurance, according to data provided by Boulger. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Dec. 13 rose to 1.92 million, according to ABC News. The 4 percent unemployment rate in the Berkshires was close to the Massachusetts rate of 4.7 percent, and in September 2024, the county's unemployment rate was 3.4 percent. The last time Berkshire County's unemployment rate was over 4 percent was in 2021 (4.9 percent), and the highest this decade was 9.4 percent in 2020. “It’s pretty comparable, and anything under 5 percent unemployment is considered full employment, which means that there are job opportunities for people who are looking, and it’s still keeping the economy going,” Boulger said. Some level of unemployment is natural, Boulger said, adding that “a small amount of unemployment allows companies to hire and prevents labor shortages.” Boulger, who has been working in the field for almost 35 years, said that the workforce goes through ebbs and flows. She added that Massachusetts has stable labor participation and fairly strong economic conditions, but did cite recent job losses in retail, manufacturing and food service sectors. Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield, said that while AI is changing the hiring process, it is not yet being used locally to substitute for actual workers. Griswold said that she has seen a slowdown in the job market and that some people are passively looking for work — meaning they are currently employed and not necessarily applying for jobs, but are keeping an eye out for a better fit or their next opportunity. She added that toward the end of the year, a lot of people get hired for companies they were temping at, as companies want to meet certain numbers by the end of the year. Boulger said the pandemic reset the economy at all levels, impacting every industry and changing workforce dynamics. In the past five years, the Berkshires have lost about 2,000 people in the labor force, she said, adding that many job seekers want more virtual or remote opportunities. “I think job seekers have a different expectation than they did five years ago,” Boulger said. Boulger said that challenges facing the workforce include job growth, AI integration, skill gaps, worker well-being and workplace culture. A population decrease has also impacted the workforce as 22- to 45-year-olds are migrating out of the region. There are more than 3,000 jobs currently open in the area, Boulger said, adding that businesses are struggling to find skilled workers. The MassHire Career Center and Workforce Board are working to develop training programs and career pathways to get people the skills they need to fill those gaps. Artificial intelligence has also changed the hiring process in the region. Boulger said that most candidates are adapting to get noticed in the initial job screening process, and MassHire is helping people prepare their resumes. “It seems like a very impersonal process,” she said. “A lot of our employers are still using AI to help prescreen candidates." In the Berkshires, the largest and fastest-growing employer is health care and social assistance, Boulger said. She also highlighted educational services, retail trade, accommodations, manufacturing and the food service industry. Molari Employment and Healthcare Services office in Pittsfield works to recruit home health care providers and connect them with clients. Griswold said that direct care workers are always in demand, something she deals with firsthand with Molari’s home care agency and its clients. “We could bring [10 direct care workers] in tomorrow, and we’d have them all placed by next week,” she said of the agency that has been in business since 1983 staffing and recruiting home health care providers. Helping younger workers find jobs is also a priority, as unemployment in that age group has risen. In November, the national unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds climbed to 10.6 percent, the highest since 2021, according to CNN. Boulger said that MassHire has internship programs at the high school and college level, along with programs for young adults that connect them to career pathways in health care, manufacturing, clean energy and education. Even with unemployment ticking up, workforce leaders say the region’s challenge is less about job availability than ensuring workers have the skills — and expectations — to meet a changing economy.

Title: How Some Newsrooms Are Defying the Industry Odds

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Even as layoffs ravaged newspapers, magazines and TV networks in 2025, journalism leaders reveal why they’re bullish about the future Axios CEO Jim VandeHei declared last month that we’re living in a “post-news” era, a world shaped by personalized content that allows people to create their own realities. “America’s information ecosystem is badly broken, deeply polluted and increasingly dangerous,” he wrote. Yet despite that sobering conclusion, and following a year in which many news outlets, including Axios, cut jobs, VandeHei told TheWrap he felt confident about the future. “I actually go into next year probably the most bullish I’ve been for high-end media in five years,” he said. The numbers would suggest otherwise. Sweeping layoffs throughout the broader media industry reached new heights in 2025, according to the executive staffing firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The media industry — measured by television, news, film and streaming — announced 17,163 job cuts this year as of November, up 18% from the same period last year and ahead of the total 15,039 in 2024. It has felt like no one is immune. Throughout 2025, TheWrap chronicled cuts at legacy newspapers (Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune), magazines (People Inc., Penske Media, Condé Nast), digital media companies (Vox Media, Business Insider) and TV networks (CNN, CBS News, NBC News). This slashing of jobs reflects a yearslong crisis gripping the media industry, in particular news, as it faces challenges stemming from shifting consumption habits toward creator-led programs, the threat of generative AI platforms siphoning away traffic from news websites, a retreat of ad spending and industry consolidation. It’s forced some journalists to figure out which options remain in a beleaguered industry and how best to serve audiences as attention spans have splintered. There are some bright spots: News-specific cuts were actually down last month (2,254) compared to the same period last year (4,537), according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, and successful startups, like the Congress-focused Punchbowl News and center-right Bulwark, are growing. MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) staffed up in 2025 as it split from NBC News, while the California Post, a West Coast extension of the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, is building a newsroom for its 2026 launch. Still, given the grave challenges facing the industry as a whole entering the new year, TheWrap spoke with leaders of growing media organizations about what they see that’s working. “I feel very confident that if you are a media company that produces distinct content, either because of your expertise or because of the personalities that you have on payroll, that business is getting better and better,” VandeHei said. As many of the nation’s top newsrooms retreat, a collection of outlets found ways to expand. Politico founder Robert Allbritton gave $20 million to his nonprofit, the Allbritton Journalism Institute, in 2023 to create a nonprofit newsroom, NOTUS (News of the United States). Its mission was to produce “empathetic and brutally honest” reporting on Congress and Washington by pairing a group of 10 fellows, or reporters in training, with a staff of seasoned reporters for two years. NOTUS has since drawn from the ranks of Politico, Axios, the Daily Beast and NPR, and has reported exclusively on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s presidential ambitions and on fake citations in a report published by the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Health and Human Services Department. The site has rotated through the White House’s “New Media” seat during its press briefings, with one NOTUS reporter getting on Donald Trump’s radar in May. In addition, its first class of 10 fellows “graduated” from the program earlier this year, with some landing jobs at Bloomberg, Politico, the Miami Herald and other top outlets. “Everyone who wanted a journalism job has gotten a journalism job, and a good journalism job,” NOTUS editor-in-chief Tim Grieve, a former top editor at Politico and National Journal, told TheWrap. Grieve said the newsroom now operates as a for-profit entity, though all profits are sent back to Allbritton’s institute. Some of those NOTUS’ donors support the website, he said, due to its new “Washington Bureau Initiative,” which assigns NOTUS fellows to report on state congressional delegations in 12 states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Grieve called the decline in local reporting “a real crisis for journalism and for democracy.” “Most local newspapers, the ones that used to have Washington bureaus, mostly don’t anymore, and so there’s really no one out there keeping tabs on the specific members of a state delegation for the readers back home,” Grieve said. Axios, meanwhile, has consistently expanded its Axios Local initiative, which has created 34 news arms since its launch in 2020 in cities such as Miami, Atlanta, Portland and Boston. VandeHei, Axios’ CEO, plans to expand the program to areas including Colorado and Ohio next year, bringing the total to 41 by early next year. VandeHei told TheWrap the current collision of technology and reporting has allowed news outlets to break into local markets more efficiently than they could five years ago, and he wanted to “perfect” the local model by the end of 2026. “If we could fix local, which I think is the hardest problem to fix, and we could do that at scale, I think that would be a great gift to society,” VandeHei said. “I think local news is really important, and I think it’s a really hard business, and if we can crack that code, I would feel really good about life.” Axios, which was bought by Cox Enterprises in 2022, has also expanded into video once again through the first season of “The Axios Show,” a one-on-one conversation series between Axios journalists and newsmakers that highlights their perspectives. Its first season guests included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and VandeHei said “it looks like” there would be a second one. Axios is also testing a video component to its “Behind the Curtain” column, authored by VandeHei and co-founder Mike Allen. “We’re pretty great at convening and getting really interesting people on camera doing good interviews,” VandeHei said. “So that’s a good business.” VandeHei, who had to cut 19 staffers last year at Axios, acknowledged the “painful and awful” reality of those layoffs. But he said that media companies needed to adapt quickly if they wanted “to be able to last forever.” “It’s going to be the hard part for all companies and all employees in basically every industry,” VandeHei said. “Going forward, you’re just going to have to be more agile and just realize that reality is what reality is. Things are just shifting faster than at any point in humanity, and you just have to find ways as a business and as an individual to keep up and to evolve, and that makes people nervous.” Grieve, the NOTUS editor, said the company has experimented with AI to support some of its backend models, but it wasn’t considering following other news outlets’ lead in licensing its content to companies like OpenAI or Amazon or using the technology as a substitute for reporting. “AI cannot tell you what is in the head of a politician working on Capitol Hill or what his next move is going to be,” Grieve said. “But great reporters can do that, and as someone who’s hired a ton of journalists over the years, I know how hard it is to find people who can truly break news and deliver information that people don’t have.” Axios struck a content licensing deal with OpenAI in January 2025, joining a collection of other media outlets, but it does not use ChatGPT to produce stories. VandeHei said outlets that’ve experimented with AI to generate stories were engaging in a “stupid strategy” that wasn’t distinctive enough to stand out from human-generated work. The future for outlets that seek to rise above the threats posed by technological advancements and shifting consumer habits, VandeHei said, is to report out “distinct, unique, human, verified” journalism that can stand apart from those that try to appeal to a generic audience. He singled out Punchbowl News and The Information, both of which cater to insider audiences, as well as giants like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal that have managed to convert a specific audience into devoted, paying subscribers. “I would tell anybody in any industry, buckle up,” VandeHei said. “The hypervolatility is here, and it will only intensify.”

Pennsylvania saw thousands of workers lose their jobs in 2025 as dozens of companies submitted Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry this year, informing the state of large layoffs. The closing of Crozer Health resulted in 2,651 people being laid off. The collapse of Rite Aid led to more than 1,000 corporate employees being laid off. The number of Rite Aid employees laid off was much higher, considering the company closed more than 300 stores in the state in 2025. Workplaces with fewer than 50 employees aren’t required to notify the state. The federal WARN Act offers protection to workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide a 60-day notice of mass layoffs or business closings involving a large number of layoffs. Enforcement of the WARN Act falls under the U.S. Department of Labor. Typically, an employer must submit a notice to the state if it will shut down a plant and the shutdown will result in a job loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. Employers also must give notice if they plan to lay off 500 or more employees in a 30-day period or if they will be laying off at least 50 people and those people represent at least 33 percent of their active workforce. Please note that some of the layoffs listed below have not happened yet, but the WARN notices were filed earlier this year. While most WARN notices are permanent, there are times when they are temporary and times when the affected employees are hired immediately by another company taking over a contract. All of the employers below announced layoffs of at least 250 people in Pennsylvania in 2025: SPS Technologies - 251 Located at: 301 Highland Ave., Abington Township, Montgomery County, near Jenkintown The manufacturing company, which produces fasteners and other materials for the aviation industry, laid off 251 people after a fire broke out at its plant earlier this year. “This layoff is a result of the unforeseeable business circumstances and economic downturn caused by the fire at our facility on February 17, 2025,” the company said in the WARN notice. Fourth Street Barbecue - 252 Located at: 3 Arentzen Blvd., Speers, Washington County, near Charleroi The company laid off 252 people. Spark Therapeutics - 298 Located at: The biotechnology research company laid off 298 employees at the three locations in Philadelphia. In addition, some remote employees were laid off as well. Instant Web - 298 Located at: 100 Industrial Drive, Tilden Township, Berks County, near Hamburg Instant Web, doing business as IWCO laid off 298 people due to a closing. The company is based in Minnesota and provides advertising services. Corelle Brands - 323 Located at: 12000 Molly Pitcher Highway, Antrim Township, near Greencastle, Franklin County Glassware and dishware company Corelle Brands, formerly known as Instant Brands, laid off 323 people due to a closing. Corelle’s brands include Instant, Corelle, Pyrex, Corningware, Snapware and Chicago Cutlery. Wilson Creek Energy - 332 Located at: Wilson Creek Energy/Corsa Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January and laid off 332 people at the 11 locations in March. The company produces metallurgical coal. Comprehensive Logistics - 365 Located at: 609 Memory Lane, Springettsbury Township, York County The company laid off 365 people in September at the location. IG Design Group Americas - 383 Located at: IG Design Group Americas closed three facilities and laid off 383 people on Aug. 26. Design Group Americas designs, manufactures, sources and distributes a variety of products in the seasonal, stationery, gift, craft and toy categories. The Berwick-area plant manufactured bows and ribbons as well as materials used in the floral industry. The company said at the time that it was selling its business segments while winding down its manufactured woven ribbon products business. “Like many companies in the consumer products sector, DGA has been navigating a challenging operating landscape for several years, compounded by the loss of a major customer, who entered liquidation and significantly impacted DGA’s revenue as well as new trade tariffs imposed in 2025 that increased operational costs, affected pricing strategies, and contributed to reduced customer orders,” the company said in a news release. “The Company’s decision to pursue an in-court process was driven by liquidity constraints, substantial working capital requirements, and the seasonal nature of significant portions of its business.” The “major customer” that entered into liquidation was JoAnn, according to the retail industry publication, RetailDive. Amazon - 432 Located at: 17 William Drive, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, near Imperial Amazon laid off 432 people — 273 regular associates and 159 seasonal associates whose temporary assignments were ending — due to a planned renovation project at the facility. The layoffs took place on March 12. The company said employees who accepted internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to March 12 would not be laid off. Oak View Group - 522 Located at: 150 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia The company’s contract at Citizens Bank Park for the Philadelphia Phillies will end on Dec. 31, 2025. The company provides housekeeping and general maintenance operations for the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The company told state officials its contract wasn’t renewed. The Oak View Group told the state it has 522 employees, of which 500 are part-time and are under a collective bargaining agreement. Oak View Group services multiple venues in the Philadelphia area and officials said it welcomed employees to apply for other positions in the region. Cleveland-Cliffs - 664 Located at: The company closed both steel plants. Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 68 salaried employees and 491 bargaining unit workers at the Steelton plant. The 151-year-old Steelton plant produced rails that carry freight and passengers, along with steel for heavy machinery, power generation plants and military applications such as submarines. “Weak demand and insufficient pricing for the products produced at our Steelton steelmaking facility has led Cleveland-Cliffs to conclude that this facility is not economically viable in the current market conditions,” the company said in a WARN notice. The company laid off 10 salaried employees and 97 bargaining unit workers at its plate finishing plant in Montgomery County. United Natural Foods Located at: 4255 E. Independence Drive in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, near Schnecksville Food wholesaler United Natural Foods closed the distribution center and laid off 717 people. Among the employees were 172 truck drivers. The distribution center closure is due to UNFI ending its agreement to provide services for Key Food. Rhode Island-based UNFI provided the following statement at the time to PennLive: “Recently, UNFI and Key Food mutually agreed to transition Key Food’s conventional grocery products business in the Northeast to another wholesaler. We believe this transition will be a better fit for Key Food and allows UNFI to exit an unprofitable relationship. At UNFI, we are continuously evaluating our distribution network to ensure we are serving our customers and suppliers as efficiently and effectively as possible. As part of these efforts, we will be ending operations at our Allentown distribution center in July 2025 and will transition these customers and suppliers to nearby distribution centers in our network. Moving Allentown’s volume to nearby DCs will enable us to serve our local partners in an efficient and sustainable way going forward." Crothall and Morrison Healthcare Located at: 3400 Spruce St., Philadelphia (Penn Medicine) Crothall and Morrison Healthcare is laying off 795 people. The layoffs were announced in 2025 but won’t take place until Feb. 1, 2026. Rite Aid Located at: The drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy a second time in May and went out of business in September. The company laid off 501 people who worked at or reported to the Valley Green Office Facility at 200 Newberry Commons. The drugstore chain also laid off 595 people who reported to the company’s headquarters at 1200 Intrepid Ave. Rite Aid said the following in the WARN notices: “Rite Aid only recently received notice from a significant vendor shortening and restricting payment terms, which could cause Rite Aid’s loan to our lenders to be accelerated,” the company said in the WARN notice. “Rite Aid’s lenders have informed us that they will not provide future funding for Rite Aid to cover payroll and employment related expenses if we retain the entirety of our current workforce.” “As a result, we have no choice but to conduct employee separations at this time to enable us to continue to meet anticipated future payroll and employment related expenses.” “In addition, the dramatic downturn in the economy, potential litigation, and increased costs (including tariffs) from our suppliers and landlords have necessitated employee separations that were unforeseen, as we were actively seeking funding and pursuing several alternative strategic transactions with the hope that this action could be avoided or postponed.” Crozer Health In what was one of the largest layoffs in recent years in the Keystone State, the hospital system closed multiple locations in Pennsylvania and 2,621 people were laid off. At least one county, two cities and a township issued emergency declarations following the hospital closing. Prospect Medical Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Initially, a buyer agreed to purchase the operations, but later backed out of the deal. Prospect then reached an agreement with the state to appoint a receiver to take over the strategic decision-making and finances of Prospect for the Pennsylvania facilities from Feb. 5 to March 5. The agreement was later extended to April 18. On April 9, Prospect said it received an offer from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which intended to provide $5 million in funding, the majority of which would be a donation to Prospect, to allow for a further extension of time to reach an agreement on a purchase of the Pennsylvania facilities. On April 17, Prospect said it was informed that the donation would no longer be available to allow for the extension. With no buyer and no additional funding, Prospect said it was forced to close operations and permanently lay off all employees at its facilities in Chester and Delaware counties. The closings took place in April. At the time, Chester Mayor Stefan Roots had signed an emergency declaration for the city in response to the Prospect’s closing announcement. “City Council and I are devastated by this crisis, and we are taking every possible step to address the negative impact this closure will have on the City of Chester and its residents,” Roots said. “We are actively working with the receiver and his team to identify viable solutions that will ensure our residents continue to have access to prompt emergency medical services, which will be impacted by Prospect’s irresponsible actions.” Daniel Urie is an award-winning business reporter for the PA Media Group/PennLive/The Patriot-News.

Title: Entertainment and Media Bloodbath Widened in 2025: 17,000 Jobs Slashed

The year 2025 was a bloodbath for film, streaming, television, and news workers in Hollywood as the media continued its downward spiral from its once commanding position as a leading American institution. The Wrap reports that television and film lost upwards to 17,000 jobs in 2025, a loss 18 percent higher than last year. News divisions, for instance, cut about 2,254 jobs across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming services through November of 2025. The loss, though, fell below the 4,537 job losses in 2024. “The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation,” the Wrap added. The FCC approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media and as the year came to a close Warner Bros. Discovery also began its move to merge with whatever outfit will end up buying it in the coming year. But job loss was a constant across it all. Even Disney continued its trend of mass layoffs despite still holding out on its own. The layoffs will continue, too, and Artificial Intelligence might be to blame for much of it. According to the World Economic Forum, 41 percent of companies worldwide will lay off workers over the next five years because they intend to begin increasing reliance on AI technology. One example is the workforce depletion at Amazon, which castoff 14,000 employees in October. This AI issue has already cost tens of thousands of current and future jobs in Hollywood, analysts say. A report from June noted that as many as 200,000 Hollywood jobs will either be lost or won’t ever be created thanks to AI. Still, some new jobs will undoubtedly be created because of AI as some workers will be needed to control the tech. Regardless, The Wrap added that 71,000 layoffs occurred in 2025 thanks to AI. At year’s end, the biggest loser appears to be Paramount, which shed 2,000 employees. Comcast’s Versant cable shed 150, which was seven percent of its workforce, and Disney laid off less than 800 across its various holdings and divisions worldwide, The Wrap continued. After years of heavier layoffs, Warner Bros. only shed about 100 across its cable holdings. But that will certainly tick upward once WBD is bought out next year. In fact, some analysts expect WBD to lose upwards to 6,000 employees after its buyout. The film industry in Los Angeles continued to contract in 2025. Hollywood had lost 100,000 jobs by the end of 2024 — or a 30 percent decline — as film and TV productions moved to other U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, or places overseas. And by April of this year, Hollywood ranked in only 6th place for the number of film and TV productions operating there. And Deadline reported in October that the downward trend in film and TV production continued through the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, media otherwise also continued contracting as news and print media either laid off workers, canceled expansion plans, or shut down completely. Publishers Dotdash Meredith dumped 143 employees, and then after the rebranded to People Inc., shed another 226. The Washington Post eliminated four percent of its workforce, or 100 workers, CNN dumped 200 staffers, PBS laid off 15 percent of its workforce, CBS News cancelled the streaming companions to CBS Mornings and CBS News and eliminated those employees, and Business Insider dumped 21 percent of its staff. Layoffs were also felt at Variety, Rolling Stone, and Billboard. The media will continue facing tough times next year and there seems to be no end yet in sight to a leveling.

Title: Looking Forward into 2026 – Predictions for a New Year

It is time again. Here we sit at the start of a new year and I am once again going to don the mantle of an oracle… false oracle to be sure, but let me do my cosplay… and foretell the doom of this next spin around the sun. And after 2025, I am in a foul mood. It is easy to be that guy who sees only the bad outcomes. As the quote goes: Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend So you’ll have to pardon me if my 2026 predictions… and we’re back to predictions after 2025 failed to deliver on wishes in dramatic style… if they are not rife with sunshine and lollipops. Welcome to 2026 That said I once again want to remind people that predictions are not wishes. These are not things I want to come to pass. They are things I think are likely to come to pass given past behavior and the state of the industry and the economy overall. If I am bleak, it is merely because I have been conditioned by the world to have that point of view. For those wanting a past accounting… well, who am I to tell you what to do with your free time. But there is a history here. Now I am back around for another turn. So let’s get on with it. What will 2026 bring? 1. Bloodbath at Redwood Shores EA will be… well, I am not sure what it will be at the end of 2026. But I am pretty sure the Saudis will be getting out the bone saws once more and what was once EA will end up with more pieces cut off than Jamal Khashoggi corpse in the embassy in Istanbul. This seems like a gimme frankly. 2. More Microsoft Mayhem Phil Spencer has but two choices to keep his obscene annual bonus going. He either has to improve sales or he has to cut expenses. Given where the industry has been headed, and the unfavorable reaction to the price increase for the XBox Game Pass, I am going to bet on cost cutting. And what is the biggest expense? Employees. If they don’t cut at least another 1,000 staff from the XBox division I will be amazed. My final score on this one will be the percentage actually cut relative to 1,000. So nobody gets laid off, zero points. But if Phil axes 2,000 people, I am claiming 20 points. So basically, 0.01 points per person laid off. Sorry to value people at such a low rate, but at least I am not throwing them out in the street personally. 3. WoW Midnight Modest Launch We already have a date. I started sketching this post back in October and had a placeholder for the launch date, picking April 20th. But now we know it will be here on March 2, 2026, much earlier than I expected. So prediction alteration time! I am going to predict that there will be no follow up press release about how WoW Midnight was a huge success with cherry picked metrics to prove it was the best ever… WoW expansion with housing, for example, because I think Warlords of Draenor will probably still be ahead of it, and Tom Chilton telling us all that garrisons were housing counts in my book. I will allow no ret-con of that. 4. The Big Chill for WoW Classic My gut and intuition says that the J. Allen Brack “you think you do, but you don’t” faction gained ascendancy at Blizz when WoW Classic didn’t turn into a low-effort eternal cash machine. Between them dropping WoW Midnight on top of the WoW Anniversary Classic launch of The Burning Crusade and the retail team just straight up taking the nostalgia card for itself in the form of the remix seasons to fill out the fact that they cannot, after more than 20 years, make an expansion with two years of content (or make expansions faster FFS), WoW Classic seems on the outs. So my prediction is no new servers, no speeding up the languishing expansions, and absolutely no movement on anything that might feel even a bit like Classic Plus. WoW Classic Warlords of Draenor will land in the back third of the year and that will be it. I am going to claim five bonus points if Blizz puts out a roadmap and doesn’t bother to include and WoW Classic plans. 5. Nothing Else New in Irvine For all the resources they have and the mighty reputation they have earned for quality and polish and stealing ideas and reinventing them better, Blizzard will bring nothing new to the table in 2026. No announcements, no surprises, no additions to their lineup. They will be milking their current titles until the last layoff. See, doing something new is much higher risk than living on past glory. 6 . Lawsuit Wins for Against Pirate Servers Both Blizzard and Daybreak will win their cases against Turtle WoW and The Heroes Journey respectively. I think that is pretty much a gimme here. The case law is clear and none of the arguments offered justify taking another companies IP and assets to start their own business. Fan arguments in support of either made up requirements or different layers of “but I want it.” Now, will the win help the companies or actually shut down similar operations? Not a prediction that is part of the scoring, but I will say “no” on both counts. 7. A Rain of Tears in Norrath Ongoing poor performance by the aging stable of Daybreak titles is going to mean layoffs. Again, predictions are not wishes, but we’ve seen how this has gone in the past… and all the more so with Eros Capital Partners AB now heading the board following their demand for more cash payments straight to their pockets. This will be why, the explanation for my prediction below about an EQII special rules server for 2026. 8. H1Z1 is Still Dead Like the bit about Generalissimo Francisco Franco back in the early SNL days, H1Z1 is not coming back from the dead no matter how many times Ji Ham says to investors that it is an extremely important IP in the Daybreak portfolio. The promise of a new version of the game with a 2026 release will be revealed a fiction… or, more likely, not revealed at all as the Ji Ham is likely to pull a John Riccitiello SWTOR move and drop all mention and claim it isn’t what investors are interested in if pressed at the earnings call. 9. EverQuest 3 Same as H1Z1. It’s dead Jim… or Firiona… or whoever. Daybreak will only buy new titles, like Palia, but won’t make anything outside of their current MMO lines. We probably won’t KNOW it is dead, but it will be the old school Daybreak treatment of never mentioning it again… certainly not in 2026. 10. EverQuest Special Rules Server for 2026 The EQ team is under some pressure. Numbers are down and The Heroes Journey was alleged to have been pulling in something around $100K a month for a dumbed down, multi-box, speed leveling version of the game. (Yes, there was more to it, but I swear that is all most people gushing about it seemed to mention.) That has to have made some impression on the team. Enough to get through their “Hardcore Heritage Forever” mindset? One hopes. What they should do is work on a “Tour de Norrath” special server. Bonus xp, mob health all dropped to make most things soloable at level, even by a warrior who can only shield bash and kick with their auto attack, with expansions being dropped at a dizzying rate; something like 8 weeks for vanilla and then 4-6 weeks for every expansion thereafter. Raids will be sized so that a group of three can do them, save for the Sleeper, who will require a full group. What they will do is turn the dials they already have… xp rate, unlock rate, starting expansion… and pretend they have done something new and innovative. It will not thrill. [I wrote this before we got the news about what Daybreak was planning, but now we know that. so how it plays out will be the biggest part of any scoring.] 11. EverQuest II Special Rules Server for 2026? Nope! We’re not going to get one for 2026. Reasons noted above, but also their popularity has not been established the way the EQ versions have. 12. Norrath Expansions All the same, both EQ and EQII will announce Q4 expansions that will riff off of some location we have visited already. That seems like a safe bet even with the last part. Not a 100% gimme this time. 13. LOTRO Difficult Issue Avoidance SSG has made it clear that they are going nowhere near the scourging of the Shire until they have milked the rest of the appendices of the series completely dry of content and they have trivialized the breadth of Middle-earth with murder for hire and FedEx quests. They’re like the Borg of Middle-earth, and all must be assimilated. But I think they have gone far enough south into Harad. They will need to go in another direction. So, my prediction in three parts; there will be an expansion (2 points), it will ship in December (2 points), and it will be set in the east, somewhere along the shores of the Sea of Rhun (6 points). Fight me! 14. New Eden: Two Expansion, Two Events, One Fanfest EVE Online will follow the now well set pattern of days, with a spring and fall (or summer and winter to use their terms, but May and November aren’t summer or winter where I live) expansion and the Crimson Harvest and Winter Nexus events… and Fanfest. And that will be the roadmap for 2026. Anything else will just be some login rewards, Twitch drops, and a cash shop sale. 15. New Eden to Remain Just EVE Online Neither EVE Vanguard nor EVE Frontier will progress to the point of even an early access launch. The former will remain the wet dream of a few key individuals at the company who still want to will this into being after 15 years of failure. It isn’t going to happen. The latter… well, CCP simply won’t be able to solve the economic contradictions of blockchain, which tries to pretend that supply and demand isn’t a thing. But they cannot drop it due to Marc Andreeson’s money paying the bills, but doing what Andreeson wants will drive any actual gamers away, leaving just the speculator class looking for another get rich quick scheme. If they ship, they die, so they will continue to pretend to be trying to solve the problem while cashing Andreeson’s checks. 16. Drone Regions Consolidation One of the big changes in New Eden this year was the evacuation of the Drone Regions of null sec and the subsequent land rush by smaller groups to grab territory there. There were about 20 groups on the map at one point. That has already slimmed down to 14. By the time we get around to scoring this I am going to say there will be just three groups, either alliances or recognized coalitions of alliances, in the Drones. 17. NetEase to Buy CCP from Pearl Abyss We got hints that CCP was being shopped around in 2025 and, frankly, there are few suitors that make as much sense as NetEase. They already run the EVE Online server in China as well as EVE Echoes. Why not buy the whole thing? They don’t have to close the deal in 2026, they just have to announce it. I mean, the gaming press acts like any such announcement means the deal is complete anyway, so why fight it? The only alternatives are Tencent buying them or Crimson Desert being a smash hit. I’ll give myself a couple points for either of those options just because I mentioned them. But it has to be NetEase for the full 10 points. 18. The Crimson Desert Blahs Years in the making… and promising… we have a ship date for Crimson Desert at last. March 19th. And, frankly, they had better make that date. What then? Will this be the massive hit with rave reviews that restores the fortunes of Pearl Abyss and allow them to hold onto CCP while getting out from under their bad investments. I don’t think so. But how to quantify that for a prediction? Well, thanks to Fantasy Critic League, I now pay attention to review scores. So I will go with that. Crimson Desert is going to land with an Metacritic review score of 80, which is the honorable mention, fine work but not outstanding bracket a lot of game land in. So a score of 80 gets my a full 10 points, but I will tick off 2 points for each point its score goes above or below 80. That will be the partial credit metric. 19. The Perilous voyage of a Ship of Heroes I mean, they shipped their game. They got the business model completely wrong and now it peaks at 10 concurrent players on a good weekend. That is completely unsustainable. There will be no subscription requirement by the end of the year. That simply has to go. Big titles cannot sustain that, these guys certainly won’t make it work. That means it will go “buy to play,” will institute a free to play mode, or will simply shut down. But the subscription idea will die in 2026. Jan 2 addendum: Another one I wrote in October and then forgot to go edit. This already happened, I even wrote about it. So, zero points for predicting the past. Going to need one of those bonus predictions to land if I want a perfect 300 score! 20. Camelot Undone I see three paths forward for this incredibly late bloomer of a title. We’re already a dozen years past the promised ship date… still two years shy of the Duke Nukem Forever slip, but nothing to be proud of either… and the madness of Mark Jacobs is going to have to find an endgame somewhere. So my prediction, like Gaul, is divided into three possibilities. Given the complete lack of success of their other title, Final Bland: Ragnarok, which is now dead and gone, why would we believe Camelot Unchained is going to do any better. At some point investors are going to stop writing checks. The industry remains in a down cycle, investors are already skittish, further funding will look like throwing good money after bad. My special favorite because “Angry Marc” Andreeson, a man so lacking in self reflection that he has become the Pillsbury Doughboy parody of Sand Hill Road venture capitalist, has no interest in video games except to the extent that they further his desire to make even more unearned wealth by implementing a tax on the internet through blockchain. I am going to give myself 10 points if one of these comes to pass… but if Mark Jacobs manages to pull of a second I am going to grant myself a bonus five points, with a full 10 point bonus if he manages the hat trick. [This was the first prediction I wrote back in October, and I was in a bad mood. But it is so complicated, I am going to leave it as is in tribute to past me.] 21. Palworld Injunction Nintendo has been pissed about Palworld for quite a while now and has gone so far as to get patents approved that seem aimed and going after any title that emulates the whole “throw an object to catch a pet” idea that they see as the heart of its Pokemon titles. This year we’re going to get a resolution… and Nintendo is going to lose, having pushed too far while ignoring prior art. 22. No Man’s Sky 10th Anniversary We’ll get a bit update for the game’s tenth birthday. That goes without saying. And it will be a lot of cool stuff. But it won’t hit like Voyagers did with the introduction of corvettes. Peak concurrent users on Steam will be my measure for this. I am going to take stand at the 50K line and my score will go down 2 points for every 10K above that the game goes. This is one where I want to be wrong, but I have to look at history. 23. No Man’s Sky All About the Base Meanwhile, my stab at what we will get in 2026 is bases. The whole base building aspect of the game is a bit chaotic, tossed together, and feels like there is a lot of room to improve. So Hello Games is going to go all in on making sure you can make the space home of your dreams, with a landing pad that will work for your damn corvette already. 24. No Fire to be Lit Light No Fire will remain a ghost title for 2026. No dates, no early access, no roadmap, just vague news and nothing for players at all. 25. Guild Wars: Reforged Content Pack ArenaNet, caught by surprise by the success of Guild Wars: Reforged, will announce a content update for the game. It won’t be a whole new campaign, or even something as big as Eye of the North, but the game has demonstrated that there is demand for it, so why not give the players what they want? 26. Guild Wars 2 Expansion as Usual The pattern has been set, NCsoft expects the income, we’re just going to get another one. Probably in August. Seems about right. 27. No Official Announcement for Guild Wars 3 I mean, doesn’t ArenaNet have enough on its plate. There might be a leak or some discussion of a possibility of such an eventuality… I mean, they have to let GW2 sit untouched for a decade or so in order to go back and farm that the way they did the original… but we’re not there yet for a commitment. 28. The End of the New World as We Know It Amazon will announce the end date for New World. It might not end in 2026, but the end times will be marked in the calendar. We know it is happening and we know that Amazon isn’t going to do something like Dual Universe and make the game playable after the servers close. It will just be the end of days… so get started on that emulator now! 29. Squadron 42? More Like Squadron 86! Chris Roberts was absolutely positive that the long delayed Squadron 42 spin-off of the Star Citizen universe will ship in 2026. He says it is done and fully playable. There was even a special email update about it with “2026” in a huge size to emphasize the point. At this point I simply don’t believe him. No Squadron 42 launch… and I am going to give myself 9 point if we get some chickenshit “well, it is alpha now so you cannot criticize it” routine like we’ve had for Star Citizen for the last decade. Cloud Imperium has yet to ship a game and I don’t see that trend changing in 2026. 30. Not Coming Back Crowfall will remain dead. Alganon too. Seems like a gimme, but somebody out there believes these will return. Bonus Picks! Bonus picks are extra credit, wild ass guesses that don’t count against me if they fail to come to pass, but which get me some points if they somehow manifest into the real world. Bonus Pick 1 – AI to the Death Some studio… will it be you Krafton, or maybe this is a job for the petty and vindictive Tim Sweeney… will go all in on making a game with AI code, art assets, and audio. And it will crash and burn, becoming a complete disaster. This will need to be a big game. If you point out somebody did a tic-tac-toe title with AI, that isn’t going to count. This doesn’t mean somebody ruining their reputation by embracing AI publicly… again, Krafton, EA, and Tim Sweeney are already in that boat… but actually putting their money where there mouth is. Likewise, public revulsion and refusal to buy the game is out of bounds, it actually has to get reviewed and be announced to suck. The only reason this is a bonus pick is I am running a project that is using AI to code it and I have my doubts about the ability to produce anything complex. Bonus Pick 2 – Sports Betting Comes to EA! In looking at the Saudi purchase of EA, I am trying to figure out the upside financially. I mean, sure, the EA Sports franchise can spin money, but not enough to make the deal a net win. Meanwhile, sports betting apps are making so much money off of people that they are buying tons of ads during events to keep the gravy train running. And the Saudis know this. So I suspect that we’ll get some sort of announcement of an integration between EA Sports and gambling, likely first with the NFL, who will go along when the Saudis give them a cut. Summing Up So those are the predictions for 2026. That is 30 predictions to measure this year. Unless otherwise stated, each are worth 10 points, with partial credit available. I have a couple in there that could give me some extra credit, but we shall see if I get any of that. There are also bonus picks. I might add some more of those. But no ret-conning. I promise that. As always, the deadline is December 15th for things to come to pass. So if Amazon announces the end of New World on the 16th, I lose. But if Squadron 42 somehow ships on or after December 16th, I win, full points. That is a hard date. Now we’re off into the new year to see what becomes of us. I’d put one in place from my perspective: WoW private server (prospective) teams will have learned from Turtle WoW and won’t advertise or poke the bear, but instead will quietly continue to gain support for a Classic Plus on their own terms. If Turtle WoW didn’t do the stupid crap they were doing and essentially daring Microsoft to go after them, they’d still be around and doing Classic Plus their way. Other dev teams will learn from that and do their Classic Plus quietly. LikeLike 19. Ship of Heroes is already ‘buy to play’ in 2025. https://shipofheroes.com/new-low-price-no-subscription/ Do you get points for that? LikeLike Crap, you’re right. That was one of my early predictions and then they made the change and I already forgot I had written about it. Well, that will teach me to proof read. Zero points for predicting the past. I am already 10 points down! Let me go edit that so I don’t forget… AGAIN! LikeLike The only reason I didn’t predict PA selling off CCP in 2026 is the pride of the Pearl Abyss C-Suite. Selling the studio off that soon would be too great an admission that Crimson Desert failed. Also, bold prediction that EVE Vanguard doesn’t come out in 2026. If it doesn’t, Hilmar will be very upset. And probably the PA C-Suite because it might lower the value of CCP in a potential sale of the studio. As for Squadron 42, the largest minority shareholder (who owns 22% of CIG) just renegotiated the terms of his sale of his stock because SQ42 didn’t come out in 2025. The stock sale will happen in 2029 instead of 2028 and be based on revenue from 2026-2028 instead of 2025-2027. Another delay and things get really interesting.

Title: Year ender 2025: Amazon, Meta and other major tech giants announced massive job cuts. Why 2025 became year of layoffs

Title: For platforms, here’s what’s not going to happen in 2026
URL: http://digiday.com/marketing/for-platforms-heres-whats-not-going-to-happen-in-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Register by Jan 13 to save on passes and connect with marketers from Uber, Bose and more TikTok existing in the U.S. beyond the realms of a legal ban, Meta winning its antitrust trial, and Omnicom partnering with X were not quite on Digiday’s bingo card for 2025. Which is to say that trying to predict, especially in the world of tech and platforms, what might actually materialize at any time, let alone next year, is nearly impossible. After all, a lot of what the industry thought might happen in 2025, just didn’t. Which is why Digiday has taken a slightly different approach to 2026. Instead of predicting what might happen, here is what Digiday believes won’t actually happen in next year. However long it takes (12 months and counting), the U.S. deal with China over TikTok cannot live in limbo forever. But in the meantime, marketers are simply getting used to living with its uncertainty. As Brainlabs’ managing director of paid social, Michelle Wiltz put it, the political theater around TikTok isn’t designed for resolution but for leverage. Both governments benefit from keeping the ambiguity alive. “2026 won’t deliver a clean answer about TikTok’s U.S. ownership,” she said. “Instead, it will reinforce a new operating reality: geopolitical ambiguity is a feature, not a bug and smart marketers plan for resilience, not resolution.” Nothing has come close to what Twitter was in terms of TK. Even as X, its real-time factor is its USP — something no platform has been able to replicate. And while ads are already being tested on Threads, it’s still a long way off from getting the type of attention that warrants it becoming a viable advertising track in its own right, rather than a nice add-on placement in Meta’s Advantage+. As Collective Measures’ group director of performance media, Lauren Beerling noted, Twitter wasn’t just a text-based feed, it was heavily driven by journalists, politicians, breaking news, and cultural urgency. “Threads is intentionally avoiding that energy, meaning it won’t inherit the same commercial value,” she said. “Meta seems far more focused on making Threads a ‘pleasant conversation app’ than a real-time newswire. That will attract users, but not the intent or immediacy that generates big ad revenue.” This year was probably one of Snap’s strongest years yet. By the end of Q3, the company had made $1.51 billion in quarterly revenue. But when compared to that of its peers: Meta, YouTube, TikTok — it’s still a drop in the ocean. Basis Technologies’ client strategy and insights partner, Colleen Fielder made the point that eMarketer estimated Snap will only claim 2.1% of social ad spend in 2025. “Snap’s alternative revenue paths feel limited — the Bitmoji subscription is fairly surface-level and while there’s a lot of buzz around a Perplexity partnership, it’s far too early to treat that as a major revenue engine,” she said. Plus Australia’s ban on users under 16 and an ongoing lawsuit with the city of New York — both complicate growth and advertiser confidence. A dramatic profitability jump next year seems unlikely.” Throughout 2025, there’s been an underlying narrative: AI equals efficiency, so headcount should decrease. Except the latest industry layoffs proved that they weren’t necessarily designed to cut costs on headcount, but to open up additional revenue for AI spending. “Companies will continue to use AI to reduce labor costs — especially at the top, where efficiency narratives sell well to boards and CFOs,” said Brainlabs’ managing partner of retail, Dan Connor. “What will slow is the belief that high spending itself equals progress. Companies will stop equating massive AI budgets with innovation; 2026 is the shift from exuberance to efficiency.” Everything we’ve seen so far points to one thing only: it’s no longer IF OpenAI builds an ad business, it’s when. That’s been indirectly confirmed by CEO Sam Altman himself, head of applications Fidji Simo, the latest hires of chief revenue officer Denise Dresser and Christina MacDonald — lead counsel for ads in ChatGPT. Platforms don’t make moves without intention. “Even with the recent ‘Code Red’ which caused OpenAI to pause the ads rollout to focus on product quality, the groundwork is clearly being laid,” said Robert Kurtz, strategic business outcomes partner at Basis Technologies. “2026 feels like the year they start testing ads in earnest.” Back in April, Judge Brinkema sided with the DOJ that Google held illegal monopolies. By September, the closing stage of Google’s ad tech antitrust trial saw the DOJ target the platform’s ad tech stack — AdX. While it’s not asking for a total divestiture, pulling the exchange apart would weaken its ad server. Google’s remedies argued that the DOJ’s proposals are excessive, and offered alternative solutions — it simply wouldn’t take the result lying down. Still, that’s not to say the judge will agree, and the ultimate outcome isn’t expected until next year. Retail media exploded in 2025, creating a more complex environment for everyone. And it looks set to continue next year. “I expect continued fragmentation in 2026 with a few players growing faster, but not true consolidation yet,” said Haley Feazell, vp of global media at Mindgruve. “Real shakeouts are likely later, once growth slows, and operating costs rise — similar to the timeline we’ve seen with CTV, is my expectation.” Similarly, Basis Technologies’ evp, integrated client solutions, Amy Rumpler added that consolidation certainly won’t occur in some of the larger networks that have more advanced capabilities, and ad revenues, already realized (think CVS and Kroger). “The benefits to them owning and operating their own independent networks, where they profit off of O&O inventory and audience data, is too far along to entertain consolidation with another entity,” she said. “Unless the deal was massive (like Amazon buys all of Kroger and consolidates it with their Whole Foods brands), I don’t see it happening.” Potential investors spent 2025 at least considering the idea of buying Perplexity. Apple execs reportedly held internal talks about acquiring the AI company, as did Meta — though the latter decided to invest in ScaleAI instead. Still, what it does mean is Perplexity has spent much of the year in the shop window, while its attempts to scale its ad business barely got off the ground. But by partnering with major companies throughout 2025, such as Snap, PayPal, Pitchbook and Getty, improving its publisher monetization efforts, and releasing its browser, Comet, Perplexity has strengthened its product reach and increased revenue flow, which ultimately make Perplexity more attractive to investors or acquirers considering making an offer — and likely will next year. No one can deny that Amazon is a competitor to The Trade Desk, but it still isn’t a rival. And that’s because The Trade Desk is the DSP to the open web. It’s big enough that it hasn’t had to lower fees, and has focused on being a good partner to its agency clients. And while Amazon will continue to try and claw away at advertisers’ TTD budget (we’ve already seen from reports of Amazon offering like-for-like tests, funded by Amazon) as part of its wider aim for its DSP to become the backbone for the open web. YouTube showed its renewed confidence in live streaming with its latest product updates during its Made on YouTube event this year. And with the worries about AI overtaking creators and content, live actually bypasses those concerns. “Live is the most human format we have: messy, unedited, impossible for AI to fake convincingly (at least for now),” said Natalie Silverstein, chief innovation officer at Collectively.

Saks Global is preparing shortly to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its Neiman Marcus acquisition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal noted that the high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue did not make an interest payment of over $100 million on its bonds and is talking to creditors to secure financing for the bankruptcy process. Rising inflation and a weakening labor market have slowed discretionary spending for many consumers, including on luxury items. Saks Global has had many rounds of layoffs this year. The company aims to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to reduce its debt, a Saks Global spokesperson said in September to Reuters. It also aimed to raise cash through the sale of a Beverly Hills property. In August, the company restructured debt, which included $600 million in new money, and exchanged $2.2 billion in senior secured notes. The combination of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and other luxury retail and real estate companies aims to make it easier to compete with other department stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. The deal was funded by new investors, including Amazon, Authentic Brands Group, Salesforce, and others, with $2.2 billion in senior secured notes as well as an asset-based credit facility.
