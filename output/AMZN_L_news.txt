ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. When Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told conference attendees that “artificial intelligence is going to change literally every job,” remarks later reported by The Wall Street Journal, it was easy to interpret his words as a dire warning. And it is, but hidden in that warning is a benefit CEOs can’t afford to ignore. AI isn’t just another tech wave, as it’s a force already reshaping skills, workflows, cultures, and career paths across industries. The question isn’t whether disruption will hit your company; it’s whether your organization can adapt fast enough to stay relevant and competitive. Much like in health, where stress can either accelerate decline or build strength depending on the quality of preparation, AI presents leaders with the same choice. Viewed reactively, it erodes, but viewed proactively, it strengthens. In an interview with The Associated Press, McMillon stressed that many roles aren’t disappearing. Instead, they’re being “plussed up.” Rather than imagining a hollowed-out workforce, leaders can see AI as an amplifier that reshapes jobs rather than eliminates them. This reframing is significant as it shifts the narrative from one of scarcity to one of abundance. If jobs evolve instead of disappear, organizations gain the opportunity to redesign how work is done, how employees develop, and how performance is evaluated. It mirrors what happens in health and performance: stressors are neutral. A workout can build strength or cause injury, depending on proper preparation and a solid initial foundation. Likewise, AI can either expand opportunities or create obsolescence, depending on whether leaders build organizations resilient enough to adapt. McMillon’s warning is ultimately a reminder that organizational relevance in the AI era depends on three traits: skill diversification, adaptability, and continuous learning. They are the workplace equivalents of oxygen, metabolism, and muscle growth. And together, they protect an organization’s most valuable currency: its people. A diverse nutritional palate strengthens your body, and diverse skills strengthen your workplace. Walmart has leaned into skills-based training, even offering truck drivers advanced technical courses to ensure roles evolve rather than disappear. The same pattern is happening everywhere. According to LinkedIn’s 2025 Guide to Future-Proofing Your Career, 85% of U.S. professionals could see at least a quarter of their skills reshaped by AI. Organizations that cling to static job descriptions, credential-based hiring, and outdated cultural norms risk fragility. Those who build broad skill ecosystems create antifragility and ultimately stand out in the market. In biology, metabolism determines whether stress fuels growth or decline. In organizations, adaptability plays the same role. McMillon’s framing of jobs as “plussed up” depicts how disruption can be reframed as evolution. Instead of defaulting to mass layoffs, an adaptable organization can redesign workflows that complement human judgment, creativity, empathy, and other unique human traits with AI’s speed and scale. These companies can thus further improve their performance while also attracting top talent. Humans extend their healthspan and lifespan through lifelong learning, which involves exercising their muscles, training their brains, and refining habits over the course of decades. Organizations extend their relevance in the same way. LinkedIn data reveals AI literacy has grown 100% year-over-year, with certifications and retraining surging among other developments. Continuous learning is no longer optional; it’s an essential compounding mechanism for corporate survival. Companies that fail to embed it into their organizational DNA risk stagnant performance and losing top talent to competitors who prioritize growth. McMillon isn’t alone. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have echoed similar views: AI will stress every workplace system. But stress itself is neutral, as the outcome depends on whether CEOs have built the infrastructure to turn it into growth. Just as individuals extend their healthspan by investing in habits that pay dividends over time, leaders must extend their organization’s relevance by treating skills, adaptability, and learning as core assets. Doug McMillon’s warning is worth heeding not because it signals an end, but because it offers a blueprint for the evolution required in the next era of business.

Title: War on Labor Accelerates: Administration Predictably Embraces Guest Workers and “Anti-Capitalism” Is Labeled Terrorism

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal. Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting the comments section. While the Trump administration’s recent $100,000 fee for H1-B visas have received the lion’s share of the attention due to potential effects in the tech and healthcare fields, there was a recent policy change for lowly agricultural guest workers that shows how the administration’s immigrant worker plan is coming full circle. As we predicted, after targeting humanitarian parole, temporary protected status, and other immigrant workers, the administration is now relaxing rules for H2-A “guest workers,” a program which has been called “close to slavery.” Back in July, the administration put in place stringent in-person interview requirements for a wide range of visa holders and applicants. Only two months later, they are lifting the requirement for guest agricultural workers. Now, this could simply be an admission of error by the administration which is getting complaints about crops rotting and realizing it made a mistake. It’s more likely this was the plan as it’s what workers have been warning against and such a move fits with Trump’s priors. Are H2-B workers—those “guest” laborers in non-agricultural fields that Trump’s businesses rely on—next to be waved on in by the administration? That, too, looks increasingly likely. Key to understanding this mega project of workforce engineering by the administration is understanding who is being targeted by ICE, deported, and who is being waved into the US while others encounter roadblocks. Let’s take a look. Who Among the Immigrant Workforce Is Being Targeted for Removal About 40 percent of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented. Here’s how the makeup looks: As of 2020 there were more than 406,000 individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to reside and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country—usually with an assist from US interference ala regime change efforts or direct military involvement. The similar humanitarian parole covered another 530,000-plus. According to FERN: Another 1.7 million people work in food processing plants, per the USDA. Many are refugees, and approximately 19% are in the country without authorization, according to the New American Economy research group. In the largest food processing segment, meatpacking, the American Immigration Council estimates that 45% of all workers are immigrants and around 23% are unauthorized. While the administration goes after the unauthorized, It is also trying to get rid of TPS and humanitarian parole. Trump suspended all refugee resettlement programs via executive order save for white South African “refugees.” The Department of Homeland Security also removed Afghanistan and Venezuela from the TPS list and is trying to axe Haiti as well. That means more than 9,000 Afghan, 300,000 Venezuelan, and 200,000 Haitians in the US can be legally deported. There is a heavy concentration of TPS holders in the meatpacking industry. As of 2020, roughly 15,600 worked on farms or in food processing.The United Food & Commercial Workers union warned months ago that deportations or threats of deporation could lead to the meat shortages and price increases that we currently seeing (although there are other factors). From Investigate Midwest: Increased immigration enforcement has scared many immigrants—legal or not– into staying home after the Supreme Court allowed ICE to target people based on skin color For example, in Beardstown, Illinois, many workers at the meat processing plant were legally in the U.S. under humanitarian parole programs, but the Trump administration revoked their status. At first the administration said it was going after people with criminal records rather than conduct mass workplace raids. But there was no way that path was going to get to the stated goal of 1 million deportations by the end of the year. And so food production sites became a prime target. Yes, these raids target unauthorized immigrants. They also set back the country’s food system. Designed to Fail Recall that the administration’s plan was based not only on getting rid of workers who had built lives in the US, many of whom were trying to improve their lot through unionization efforts, but also snatching Medicaid away from all the loafers out there. This was going to somehow magically get Americans out into the fields and into the slaughterhouses despite all the evidence to the contrary. Here’s Scott Morgenstern, a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has predicted that farm owners will soon find plenty of U.S. citizens to employ. She declared on July 8 that the new Medicaid work requirements included in the same legislative package as the immigration enforcement funds would encourage huge numbers of U.S. citizens to start working in the fields instead of losing their health insurance through that government program. Farm trade groups say this scenario is far-fetched. For one thing, most adults enrolled in the Medicaid program who can work already do. Many others are unable to do so due to disabilities or caregiving obligations. Few people enrolled in Medicaid live close enough to a farm to work at one, and even those who do aren’t capable of doing farmwork. When farm owners tried putting people enrolled in a welfare program to work in the fields in the 1990s, it failed. Another experiment in the 1960s, which deployed teenagers, didn’t pan out either because the teens found the work too hard. Notably one strategy not employed by the administration is requiring higher wages and improved worker conditions. And so unsurprisingly federal labor data shows a 7% drop in the US agriculture workforce between March and July, equal to roughly 155,000 workers. Predictably, the Trump administration is turning to H2-A guest workers. In June, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the creation of the Office of Immigration Policy, which the labor secretary said will be a “one-stop shop” to help employers meet their labor needs.. And then on September 18, the State Department declared that H2-A visa holders no long must attend an in-person interview to renew their visas within 12 months of the expiration of their old one. It wouldn’t be surprising if H2-B workers are next to be waved in, perhaps based on slaughterhouse worker shortages, but also beneficial for people like Trump who employs the guest workers at his properties. Industry “stakeholders” are applauding the H2-A move, and they are asking for more—particularly longer term work permits, which are still tied to an individual’s labor and mean the employer has near complete control over the worker. In effect what’s happening is a trading out of people for exploitable workers. In the tech world, the AI bubble might be an avalanche of slop, but is useful in another way. Take Amazon, which claimed AI was taking jobs when it conducted mass layoffs only to turn around and replace those workers with cheaper H1-B alternatives. In the case of the agriculture and service sector industries, we have the government doing the heavy lifting removing immigrants and refugeesn who aren’t exploitable enough and replacing them with H2-A and H2-B alternatives. Why Capital Loves Guest Workers A crucial difference between the migrant H-2B and H-2A workers and immigrants who live and work in the US under temporary protected status or humanitarian parole is that the latter two categories didn’t have their ability to stay in the country legally tied to their work. That made them less exploitable. They were free to change jobs and unionize. That’s probably a big reason they’re being targeted for deportation. Trump has suggested that unauthorized immigrants and refugees who had built lives in the US could potentially return legally, but the administration has not provided specifics. It’s pretty clear what he means. Edgar Franks, the political director of Familias Unidas, summed it up in April—an assessment that is now shared by the likes of the AFL-CIO’s Department of People Who Work for a Living and other unions: It was meant to silence the organizing, deport as many people as possible, and to bring in a captive workforce through the H-2A program. We think that might be the ultimate plan: to get rid of all the immigrant workers who are organizing and fighting back for better conditions, and to bring in a workforce that’s under the complete control of their employer with basically no rights. Franks prediction is steadily being realized. And to back up his claim, it’s pretty remarkable how efficiently ICE and the administration target unauthorized or refugee workers who are unionized or organizing. Some examples: The United Farm Workers labor union has condemned the raid at the farm that the UFW has been actively organizing in since 2022. Of the 14 workers detained at the May 2 raid, ten were ultimately deported. UFW Secretary Treasurer Armando Elenes labels the raids as “shameful employer complicity in the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate legal protections and lower wages for farm workers.” “A legally-binding union contract has already been awarded at Lynn-Ette by a NY State-appointed arbitrator, yet Lynn-Ette is defying the law and refusing to implement this union contract,” states Elenes. As of 2024 there were 384,900 H2-A and 215,217 H2-B workers in the US—numbers that have been steadily increasing for decades and especially over the past 15 years with a more than fivefold increase since 2010. With the administration’s early moves, this number is set to increase even further. In theory, the foreign workers who obtain H-2A visas are supposed to be guaranteed relatively high wages, as well as housing in the U.S. In reality, it is not enforced, and they are left to the whims of their employers. Because they are basically indentured servants they are loved by Trump and many employers. Even the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security “acknowledge that H-2B workers face structural disincentives to reporting or leaving abusive conditions, and often lack power to exercise their rights in the face of exploitative employment situations.” The Food & Environment Reporting Network with more: …these visas are notoriously abusive to foreign workers. That’s because they effectively create a captive workforce: In contrast to other immigrant workers in the U.S. — including recipients of certain humanitarian programs, like TPS — H-2 workers’ presence in the country is tied to a particular job and employer. H-2 employees are eligible to work for whoever sponsors their visa, and it can be prohibitively difficult for them to switch jobs even if they’re mistreated. If they quit, they’re sent back to their home countries, which would ruin many H-2 workers and their families financially. (Over half of all H-2A farmworkers enter the country in debt to illegal recruiters, who charge fees for connecting workers with job contracts.) H2-A guest workers also faced a major setback in their fight to organize last year when a District Court Judge issued an injunction in August that blocked them from unionizing in 17 states. The guest worker program also features labor trafficking, rampant wage fraud, illegal recruitment fees, wage theft, and illegal threats of retaliation. Abuse is made easy by the fact that it’s almost impossible for workers to quit their jobs since their visas are tied to a single employer. Mike Rios, a DOL regional agricultural enforcement coordinator, describes the H2 program as the “literal purchase of humans.” But it’s not just the guest workers who suffer. Pain (Nearly) All Around The guest worker program might be beneficial for individual employers, but it is drain for American society. From Investigate Midwest: Undocumented immigrants paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022, without enjoying any of the benefits, such as Social Security or Medicare. Living in communities, they also contribute to local economies. Temporary visa workers, on the other hand, send most of the money they earn to their home countries. It’s also bad for all workers, including those those Americans who were supposed to take the place of immigrants and refugees. The Food & Environment Reporting Network: H-2 workers have so little bargaining power that some employers prefer to hire them over U.S. citizens — which ends up disenfranchising the American-born workers Trump and Miller say their deportations will benefit. Under federal law, employers must show they were unable to hire American workers before they’re approved to hire H-2 workers, but some employers circumvent that rule and commit visa fraud to avoid hiring Americans at higher rates. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has filed a string of complaints with the DOL, alleging that meatpacking companies have repeatedly requested increased allocations of H-2B workers as a way of undercutting wages. What about all those workers who have lived and labored here for years and in some cases decades? There’s a reason that immigration question was never settled as described here by Michael Macher: …the US immigration system runs not on the enforcement of immigration laws, but on their selective nonenforcement. Employers have relied on the state to ignore the exploitation of undocumented labor while holding the credible threat of deportation over workers. This has had the effect of strengthening employer bargaining power generally against all workers—lowering wages, weakening unions, and shifting the politics of work away from collective bargaining and wage-and-hour regulation. The interest in labor that is weak and disorganized has driven US politicians, consciously or not, to adopt the role of petty bosses, threatening the deportation of significant portions of the US workforce. Trump might be in the process of blowing up that system by turning the role of petty bosses back to the actual bosses, and he’s able to do that now because labor is so weakened after a half century of losses in the class war. Even the crumbs are now being snatched away. Weak—and in some cases counterproductive from a labor viewpoint—agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are being further crippled. And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” That means that as of now any effort from workers and unions to fight back, such as “illegal” strikes, can now be labeled “anti-capitalist” and the weight of the police state will come crashing down on them. Public sector unions are already in retreat. Immigrants who were part of communities, and in many cases unions, are being shown the door only to be replaced by indentured servants often housed away from society in squalid prison-like housing. Trump is dutifully playing his role as an accelerant and looking to make a bad program worse: The Biden administration changed the methodology for calculating the rate for H-2A workers, which resulted in a larger pay increase for some of them this year. Some farm organizations, including the NCAE and the Farm Bureau, want the Trump administration to roll back that change and expand the H-2A program to cover year-round workers, especially for dairy and livestock farms. During Trump’s first term the temporary work visa programs steadily grew a total of 13 percent larger, and he used the Covid emergency to help make it happen: During the pandemic, his administration issued a series of emergency measures that made H-2A and H-2B visas more flexible and employer-friendly. Workers were allowed to stay in the country for longer periods of time, in part because they had been deemed “essential workers,” and wages for H-2A workers were effectively frozen. Trump 2.0 is using a crisis of its own creation in order to strengthen the guest worker program and hammer all of labor. Rather than better pay and working conditions to entice American workers, we’re getting an increase in guest workers to further drive down wages and worker protections. The house of labor, which has been burning for decades, is now being doused with Trump gasoline. And the capital-labor arrangement being steadily reinforced looks for Americans a lot like the immigrant experience. All workers must sell their labor for pennies on the dollar, accept unsafe conditions, and any other types of abuse or, in the case of immigrants, face deportation to foreign prisons. For Americans, the risk is becoming homeless and tossed into US (private) prisons. And with “anti-capitalist” beliefs now labeled as terrorism, workers face even more hurdles fighting back. Indentures and serfdom. Trump et al appear nostalgic for the days of proto-capitalism when the employer (lord of the manor) had near absolute power. It also brings to mind the Dickensian “dark satanic mill era” when wages were as close to starvation level as possible. But what is one to do? That’s capitalism in its purest form and who wants to be an Anti-capitalist in the US of A? Or maybe it’s just nostalgia for the Grapes of Wrath era which was less than 100 years ago. FDR may have sanded the rough edges off industrial capitalism but Big Ag has always had special power out in the heartland. And now we have Big Tech that also loves them some unskilled labor for their warehouses–picking products rather than vegetables. The solution to the immigration problem is simple. Employers should be required to pay foreign workers the same wages and benefits as American workers. Throughout history, immigrants have been welcomed not because ordinary citizens are tolerant but because capitalists have viewed them as a source of cheap labor. The H2a program has a higher wage floor built in – the adverse effect wage. Farms that employ H2a workers in my region often have higher pay than non-H2a employers. However, because farmers already feel like they are overpaying their guest workers, work and housing conditions suffer. B2S Workers want these jobs badly, and are willing to put up with a good amount of abuse in order to keep them, and given their lack of agency in the recruitment process, workers fear the next farm could be much worse. The Somalian and Cambodian refugees I have worked with have had the ability to quit and find new jobs. Not so for the Jamaican H2a workers. The importance of this factor in incentivizing farmers in improving work conditions cannot be overlooked. I await your silent empire, Tristero. Although in this curious instance, the foreigners were paid more. But the abusive conditions are present. Black Farmworkers Say They Lost Jobs to Foreigners Who Were Paid More (NY Times via archive.ph) From 2021 The reliance on South Africans may reflect the nature of agriculture and the demographics in the Mississippi Delta, compared with places like California. “In the Mississippi Delta, row-crop production requires fewer workers but workers who have skills to use machinery and equipment,” said Elizabeth Canales, an agricultural extension economist at Mississippi State University. “We hardly have any Latinos in this remote region. Naturally, it’s easier to hire South Africans where language will not be a barrier, especially because in this area, you have a very small Spanish-speaking population.” The South Africans arrived in the region willing to work weeks that sometimes stretched to 75 hours or more, grueling schedules that might have been difficult for older local workers to maintain, industry analysts said. “And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” Chris Hedges latest explains in detail what Trump’s directive will mean to you and me: https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/trumps-war-on-america A narrow slice of the H1-B program earns the ire of many. If jobs are narrowly posted so they are hidden from domestic workers and targeted toward foreign workers, there are some inequities. Domestic people get shafted, having to train their replacements, notoriously in IT, and foreigners may get jobs but at the costs noted of passport confiscation, abuse and other ills. Transparency would help. My opinion is that H-1B and Students were targeted because many become Pro Palestinian. May not even be Trump per say, but by those who control Congress Nip it in the bud as they say Thanks Conor! All the news is about ICE, harsh immigration crackdowns, and deportations to 3rd world hell holes. Very little news on H-2B visas, and virtually no news on H-2A visas, i.e. the real reason for the immigration crackdown. Labor organization, strikes, and any sort of anti capitalism protests are now considered gateway to terrorism activities that get you on a terrorism watchlist. Alligator Alcatraz and other US prison sites being built. Republican senators and members of congress silent and in hiding from their base. The Democrats have Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries leading their base in a silent and peaceful march into economic bondage. And the MAGA base continues to wear their “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” hats in blissful ignorance over the fact that they’ve been played bigtime. Only in America, the richest country ever, where the 1% still do not have enough to fill the bottomless pit in their collective souls, could this happen.

Title: AI giant Anthropic faces possible clash with White House — as backers include left-wing Ford Foundation: sources

AI giant Anthropic is facing a possible head-on collision with the Trump administration — as concerns from conservatives multiply that the fast-growing firm carries a left-wing bias, The Post has learned. Investors in the San Francisco-based company — known for its popular Claude chatbot — include the Ford Foundation, a notoriously left-leaning group that bought $5 million worth of Anthropic shares in March 2024 in the bankruptcy of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, according to little-noticed court filings. Earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance called out the Ford Foundation by name while vowing to “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That’s after Anthropic recently irritated Trump officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes. Some at the White House have grumbled that Anthropic, whose CEO Dario Amodei is a prominent Democratic donor, could be “selectively enforcing its policies” due to differing political views, Semafor reported. Taken together, the two data points are likely to invite unwelcome scrutiny for Anthropic — even as rivals including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI have worked to curry favor with the White House, a source close to the Trump administration said. “When [the White House] is looking for a collaborative partner and suddenly they start being obstinate over White House objectives, and it comes to surface that they got a significant investment from a hostile political organization – which is what I would consider the Ford Foundation to be – I think you’re going to see a lot of eyebrows being raised,” the source added. Anthropic, whose backers include Amazon and Google, is competing with OpenAI, xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta for everything from lucrative federal contracts to crafting potential federal regulations around AI. But even before the latest flap over AI usage by federal contractors, Anthropic’s relationship with the White House – and key administration officials like AI czar David Sacks – was already seen as shaky at best. Anthropic’s Amodei called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post expressing support for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. In 2018, he described Trump as a “serious and legitimate threat to the rule of law.” During a May episode of the popular “All In” podcast, Sacks said Anthropic was part of group of tech “doomers” that he described as “committed leftists” and “Trump haters” with ties to the effective altruism movement, which once counted Bankman-Fried among its elite backers. Sacks also pointed out that several ex-Biden administration staffers had joined Anthropic and that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a Democratic megadonor, was part of its board of directors. Amodei was one of the few tech honchos who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January, though he did attend an administration event about energy policy in Pittsburgh in July. He has also raised the hackles of some AI leaders with frequent warnings about the technology’s risks. Amodei has said executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur due to AI and suggested unemployment could hit 20%. He’s also warned of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity as AI gets more advanced. Daniela Amodei, his sister and a fellow co-founder of Anthropic, has a long history of donating to Democrats, include Harris, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “When it comes to policy and trying to foment the golden age of American economic dominance, the White House is looking for partners who want to put America first and want to work together collaboratively,” the source close to the White House added. Despite its differences with the administration, Anthropic has secured a number of federal contracts – including a $200 million contract with the Department of War and a partnership with the US General Services Administration. Anthropic has also expressed support for the White House’s AI Action Plan, declaring it was “encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Anthropic’s valuation was just $18.4 billion in early 2024. But as of earlier this month, Anthropic had secured an $183 billion post-money valuation. Depending on the share structure, that means Ford Foundation’s stake, while tiny compared to key backers like Google and Amazon, has seen a huge increase in value over the last year. An Anthropic spokesperson said the Ford Foundation represents a small fraction of the firm’s overall investor base. Ford does not have any influence over Anthropic’s policy positions or business activities, the spokesperson added. “We are committed to protecting America’s lead in AI, defending and upholding America’s democratic values, and contesting the advance of authoritarian adversaries,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “As part of that commitment, Anthropic was an early mover in deploying AI for national security and intelligence work, and we work with the intelligence community in many different capacities.” The spokesperson also pushed back on the notion that Anthropic has a rift with the Trump administration. While Anthropic’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for “direct domestic surveillance and related collection of data,” multiple federal law enforcement agencies “are currently using Claude for research, analysis, and other use cases.” Other AI giants, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, have policies restricting use of their AI tools for surveillance purposes. A Ford Foundation spokesperson said: “Like any other passive investor in a company, the Ford Foundation has no role in Anthropic’s management or business activities.” Vance, who co-hosted an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” after the assassination, alleged that the Ford Foundation and the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations had provided funding to progressive magazine The Nation. The vice president slammed the outlet for misrepresenting Kirk’s words in an article titled “Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning.” In response, Open Society said it never funded The Nation, while Ford Foundation said it hasn’t funded the outlet since 2019. The allegation was part of a larger pledge by Vance to target progressive groups that he accused of stoking a rise of left-wing violence. Advertisement

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Even as US President Donald Trump’s steep hike in H-1B visa fee threatens to hit Indian software services providers, US lawmakers and agencies have separately intensified the scrutiny of the offshoring sector. Homegrown Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the country’s largest information technology (IT) services company, and India-heritage Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. were among the companies targeted by two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley and Democrat Richard J. Durbin, over hiring practices. A third senator, Tom Cotton, is considering bills to reform of H-1B programme, while his Republican peer Bernie Moreno has proposed an HIRE Act to increase taxes on companies offshoring work. Growing scrutiny makes the $283-billion local outsourcing industry even more vulnerable after Trump signed an executive order to increase the one-time fee for H-1B Visas from the current $1,000 to $100,000 starting next year. The target is the alleged misuse of H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled non-immigrants to work in the US temporarily. These permits are issued for three years with an option to renew for up to six years. Indian IT companies accounted for 70% of such visas issued in 2024. "The question is, how impactful are the letters by Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin? In my opinion, very. There could be potential Senate investigations into the issue of H-1B visas, and leaders of all the companies could be called to give sworn testimonies before the Senate," said Russell A. Stamets, a partner at Circle of Counsels, a New Delhi-based law firm. "Indian companies desperately need knowledgeable American voices to help them navigate this, not simply people who have lived in the US for some time. Cultural nuance is critical in these discussions," said Stamets. Last Wednesday, judiciary committee chairman Grassley and Durbin wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan and his Cognizant counterpart S Ravi Kumar over their hiring practices. “TCS recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 people worldwide, including American staff. For example, TCS laid off nearly five dozen employees in its Jacksonville office alone last month," read the 24 September letter to Krithivasan. TCS sponsored 5,505 H-1B employees in FY25, the second-largest beneficiary, behind Amazon.com Inc. The senators accused the company of firing Americans and substituting them with H-1B employees. “TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favor of newly hired South-Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favors by replacing Americans with H-1Bs while this investigation is ongoing," said the letter. Accused of discriminationThey accused Cognizant of discriminating against white Americans. “Last year, a federal jury concluded that Cognizant intentionally engaged in race-based discrimination by favoring South-Asian H-1B workers over American employees. The jury also found that Cognizant’s conduct warranted punitive damages. Cognizant is doing itself no favors by continuing to replace Americans with H-1B workers on the heels of this verdict," read the 24 September letter to Kumar. Last fiscal, Cognizant received approvals to hire 2,493 H-1B employees, making it the seventh-largest user of these visas. TCS, which follows an April-March financial calendar, ended FY25 with $30.18 billion in revenue, while Cognizant, which follows a January-December financial calendar, generated $19.74 billion in revenue.

TCS and Cognizant have until 10 October to respond to the letter from US lawmakers. Queries emailed to TCS, Cognizant, and senators Grassley and Durbin went unanswered.

Gigantic bags of potato chips, enough ketchup to last until the end of the decade, endless rolls of toilet paper (well, maybe post-COVID I get that one). But seriously, why does anyone need a 20-pound tub of margarine? A colleague (who may or may not be the lead weekday writer of this newsletter) wants to buy a second refrigerator for his garage just so he can store even more stuff from Costco. "The biggest pain point in my marriage is probably Costco," BI's Dan DeFrancesco told me. "Before every trip, my wife warns me not to get carried away. And then I proceed to get carried away and buy 18 pounds of chicken breasts." Look, I get it. Buying in bulk is very much en vogue these days. Just look at Costco's earnings report the other day. Sales and profit are up. Total paid memberships are rising. More people are finding the experience so compelling that they're upgrading their memberships. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said opening early for executive members boosted weekly sales by 1%. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai indicates the adjusted hours are helping the company accomplish several key goals, namely getting shoppers to visit more quickly and more often. Costco is also set to open new locations faster than usual, particularly in areas with popular stores. The goal is to relieve some of the traffic pressure in those locations, creating a better shopping experience. People talk about Costco the way some talk about religion. It's an experience, a pilgrimage if you will, for hot deals and free samples. You can get everything from ever-pricey gold bars to the ultimate inflation-proof offering: the vaunted $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. Maybe I'm just a city snob who doesn't get all the finer things in life that Costco has to offer. I'll stick with Trader Joe's and my corner bodega.

Title: Get used to an America with fewer jobs

Time Published: 2025-09-28T08:09:02Z

We're learning what America looks like with fewer immigrants and fewer jobs. The Trump administration has been cracking down on immigration over the past few months, ramping up deportations and travel bans. It recently announced a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa program applicants, which could affect some major companies, like Amazon, that leverage the program. Immigration policies could be exacerbating the defining feature of the frozen 2025 labor market: Workers haven't faced mass layoffs, but hiring has slowed to a crawl. A more slowly-growing labor force with lower levels of immigration will likely see a much lower level of job growth, but weak labor demand with weak supply means that unemployment may not spike. And even native-born workers have not yet seen a major boon to employment in that continuing slow market. Dante DeAntonio, labor economist at Moody's Analytics, said there's "no doubt" immigration policy changes are affecting the job market. "There was a clear downshift in labor force growth starting in the second half of 2024, and the labor force has flatlined so far in 2025," DeAntonio said. "The most immediate impact of this change is a likely shortage of available labor, particularly in industries that are more heavily reliant on foreign-born labor, such as agriculture, construction, and leisure/hospitality." Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said President Donald Trump aims to grow the US economy and add job opportunities for Americans. "There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws," Jackson said. "The Trump Administration is focused on protecting the American workforce, ending instances of labor exploitation or trafficking, and working with American employers to ensure they have the legal workforce they need to be successful." Below are some of the ways immigration has affected the job market. Declining immigration means a more slowly growing workforce, which could make this summer's disappointingly low job growth a new normal. One measure used to assess the labor market's performance is the breakeven rate, or how much job growth is needed to keep unemployment steady as the labor force adds more new entrants from immigration and young people aging into their working years. A more slowly-growing workforce from lower levels of immigration would make that breakeven rate drop, and that could lead to lower job growth in the long run. We won't know the full extent of how the likely decline in immigration has affected population growth for a while, so estimates for how many jobs the US needs to add each month to keep unemployment stable in the long run could vary widely. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider that if net immigration is zero, it would mean a breakeven rate close to August's job growth. However, he cautioned that we don't yet know the full extent of the immigration slowdown. A blog post from Kolko showed that the breakeven rate in early 2024 was much higher. Other estimates for that breakeven rate are higher. A Morgan Stanley note in early September said that 70,000 jobs added a month by the end of the year is probably consistent with flat unemployment. That would mean recent growth is too low. On the other end of the spectrum, David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider the payroll growth needed to keep unemployment constant could be around zero. "You've got very weak growth at this stage in the economy because we've got really no increase in the number of people available to work," Kelly said. Immigration changes don't necessarily mean a better job market for non-immigrant job seekers. The native-born unemployment rate has ticked up from January's rate. "Some people expected that a slowdown in immigration would open up jobs for native-born workers," Kolko said. People are having a hard time getting a job because companies aren't so eager to hire or lay people off as they deal with economic uncertainty. "Sending immigrant workers away is not going to insulate workers from the labor market impact of tariffs or a recession," said Chris Martin, the lead researcher at company-review and job-search platform Glassdoor. Pay is one reason DeAntonio thinks immigration changes would take a while to see a positive effect on non-immigrant job seekers. He said that "non-immigrant labor is not a perfect substitute for immigrant labor because the types of jobs and occupations filled by immigrant labor are lower paying, on average, and many non-immigrants are unlikely to fill those positions unless pay rises substantially." The recent H-1B changes could mean employers look to offshore work or check out other visas. "We will likely push to get employees O-1 visas instead now," one startup founder told Business Insider. A 2023 paper from Britta Glennon, an assistant professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, found that US multinational companies that encounter H-1B visa restrictions tend to ramp up hiring in other countries, especially in China, India, and Canada. Glennon told Business Insider that multinational companies are probably going to ramp up offshore strategies unless they really need talent in the US. "If they're intensifying the offshoring, that's more jobs and investment going abroad, rather than the US," Glennon told Business Insider, adding that such a development would run counter to the intent of the policy changes to visa programs like H-1B. She added that not all employers, including startups and universities, have the resources or option to offshore. Some sectors that rely more on immigration are not growing much. Construction employment has plateaued, for instance. "Immigration policies are definitely impacting labor supply by both pushing out immigrant workers and slowing applications to work in the US," said Martin. "It's too early to know just how many, but we are likely talking hundreds of thousands fewer workers." Kolko said in a recent analysis that employment growth has been flat in construction, home healthcare, and other industries that are more reliant on unauthorized-immigrant labor, with a three-month annualized increase of just 0.06% in August. Other private sectors together had an increase of 0.34%, which is cooler than the 2.2% at the start of the year, as the job market has softened. Tim Paradis contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: Sen. Dick Durbin, Months from Retirement, Becomes First Democrat to Criticize H-1B Visa Program
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/27/democrats-begin-to-criticize-h-1b-program-amid-mass-firing-of-americans/

A bipartisan pair of Senators is asking 10 major CEOs to explain why they are hiring Indian and Chinese H-1B migrants while they are also firing skilled American professionals. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions allocated by the H-1B lottery program,” said the September 25 letter signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL). “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years… At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in the letters. Grassley chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee. Durbin is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most pro-migration Democrats in Congress. The H-1B issue is becoming toxic for companies as federal data shows rising unemployment among young American graduates. “The Overton Window has shifted,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which lobbies against the visa programs. He added: In any other year, we would be fighting bad legislation. Now we’re seeing good legislation being introduced… Trump has come a long way from December [when he backed the H-1B program]… On November 10, we’ll have a bunch of tech workers walking around Capitol Hill, speaking to legislative staff, telling what has happened to them… Yeah, we have a lot of momentum. One letter was sent to the CEOs of Amazon, which is the biggest user of H-1B workers. Similar letters were also sent to the CEOs of Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JP Morgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy, and Walmart, which recently faced claims that an Indian executive sold a subcontract to an Indian-run H-1B firm in exchange for kickbacks. The letter asks for responses by October. Some other Democratic-aligned leaders are speaking against the program that keeps roughly 1.2 million foreign workers in the white-collar jobs that are needed by young American couples. “I’ve worked on H-1B politics for 30 years,” said a September 21 X post from Democratic-aligned investor Reed Hastings. “Trump’s $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H-1B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.” “Once in a great while, our Dear Leader does something half-right,” wrote the far-left editor of The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner: [For example] the H-1B visa program, where Trump abruptly imposed a visa fee of $100,000 per imported worker. The program, on the whole, is a travesty. It’s a modern version of international indentured servitude. Trump’s action was impulsive, weird, and theatrically disruptive rather than reformist. He didn’t say whether it was a one-time or annual fee, and reportedly he hasn’t even figured that out yet. Nonetheless, we’ll take it. “In the case of the H-1B fee, he stumbled into a useful if impulsive action. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day,” said Kuttner’s September 26 comment. Some advocates for businesses are also giving a little ground in the hope that Congress will provide more migrants for tech companies. For example, Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, told Newsweek: Neufeld said it was widely understood that the H-1B has been used to undercut American wages, and that he was hopeful Congress could finally act — at the very least to reform the lottery selection process. “Which is, I think, widely understood to be basically insane that we are deciding who is going to be part of Team America and help drive our economic fortunes by random chance,” he told Newsweek. “We wouldn’t pick our Olympic team by random chance. Why are we picking our high school immigrants this way?” Neufeld’s group is supported by investor-funded foundations. The editorial board at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post is defending the counterproductive program, but also endorses some tinkering: Sen. Jim Banks (R-Indiana), for instance, recently introduced a bill that would similarly raise wage requirements for H-1B holders and replace the visa lottery with a bidding system. Does Trump want a quick win that disappears after he leaves office — or a more comprehensive reform that will last for years to come? Still, pro-migration groups do not want to give any significant concessions to mainstream American voters. For example, Indian immigrant Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) denounced Trump’s modest curbs on the outsourcing program. Trump’s new $100k fee for H-1B visa recipients will completely upend research taking place in WA and across this country. This is bad for our hospitals, our economy, our communities — full stop. But investor groups just want more migrants, “The simplest fix would be to simply raise the annual [H-1B] cap, as Congress did temporarily in the early 2000s,” says a January report by FWD.us, a lobby group for Silicon Valley investors, adding: Congress could exempt priority immigrants, like advanced degree graduates from U.S. schools, from the caps so they do not have to go through the lottery. (Similar exemptions are already in place for employees of nonprofit and government research institutions.) Congress should also create alternative pathways targeted specifically at recruiting and retaining graduates and STEM experts, thereby moving them out of the H-1B process. This should include a true post-graduation work visa option for international students to begin their careers in the U.S., separate from training programs like OPT, as well as a dedicated green card option on the basis of a U.S. education. Similar visa options should be established for STEM experts seeking to work in industries critical to national security and global competitiveness, and for entrepreneurs ready to launch new companies and create jobs in the U.S. Investors gain from migration because the arrival of more consumers, renters, and workers generates more business activity, regardless of damage to productivity, innovation, wage levels, crime, or Americans’ ability to form and raise families. “The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” said a September 19 proclamation by Trump establishing modest curbs on the H-1B program: The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. … The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States.

Title: Tech billionaire defends massive H-1B labor pipeline, warns Trump’s reforms will ‘backfire’

By Amanda Bartolotta September 27, 2025 Michael Moritz, the billionaire venture capitalist and longtime Silicon Valley insider, published an opinion piece in the Financial Times attacking President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions. Moritz claimed the policy would damage America’s tech industry rather than protect U.S. workers. In a dramatic flourish, he likened the White House to The Sopranos, calling the fee a “caper” and accusing the administration of failing to understand “why the U.S., especially its technology sector, has worked so well.” This debate is about more than Moritz’s claims. It reveals how language can be used to reframe the issue, obscure accountability and pressure policymakers into surrendering leverage to global capital at America’s expense. Moritz is only the latest voice using familiar arguments that have long perpetuated harm to U.S. workers. The difference is that the facts, unlike opinions, can be tested, verified and held up against the record.

The blurred line between ‘skill shortage’ and ‘labor arbitrage’ Moritz argues that big tech “hires foreign nationals because they possess particular skills” and fill “areas where the U.S. has labor shortages.” But the so-called “skilled worker” narrative surrounding the H-1B visa is a total and provable myth. The H-1B program was originally pitched as a way for U.S. companies to bring in highly skilled workers when no qualified Americans could be found. But decades of evidence show that corporations use it not to fill rare gaps, but to import cheaper labor and displace U.S. professionals. Even the program’s mechanics point away from merit. The H-1B system allocates visas by random lottery, not by skill, wage level or national need. Instead, it’s the luck of the draw, not merit that wins out. The records that employers submit to the Department of Labor through the so-called PERM process tell a much different story. PERM (Permanent Labor Certification) is the only stage wherein employers are legally required to test the U.S. labor market before sponsoring a foreign national for permanent residency. If there truly were a skilled labor shortage, corporations would embrace that safeguard. Instead, they cleverly design myriad ways to avoid finding qualified Americans. Job ads are drafted with inflated requirements that few domestic candidates will meet. Notices are intentionally placed where they are unlikely to be seen. Ads are run only in the bare-minimum formats required by regulation. And after layoffs, companies like Google and Amazon simply pause PERM filings to avoid having to offer jobs back to the Americans they just terminated, a tactic openly advised by immigration attorneys. Moritz reinforces his point by listing “warehouse workers, account managers, brand specialists and dishwashers” as the kinds of jobs Americans hold. The effect is to suggest that only foreign workers fill demanding roles such as biochemists, software engineers and other high-skill positions, while Americans are concentrated in lower-level work. This framing makes U.S. layoffs and new H-1B requests appear unrelated, as if the Americans being cut were never in the same labor pool and therefore didn’t qualify for the legal notice requirement. Evidence from ongoing litigation shows otherwise. One company email cited 209 employees whose layoffs created a legal barrier to sponsoring foreign nationals in those same roles. Despite acknowledging the requirement to notify displaced Americans, the company treated them as an obstacle to be managed, rather than candidates to be rehired. This contrast with the H-1B program is critical. Unlike PERM, H-1B petitions do not require any recruitment or labor market test. Employers can file directly for foreign workers without demonstrating that no qualified Americans are available. The way companies work around the one safeguard that does exist indicates that qualified Americans are indeed available, but employers simply choose not to hire them. Impact of Layoffs on the PERM Process ‘Every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts’? Moritz’s claims that undergraduate degrees from Eastern Europe, Turkey or India are “every bit as well qualified” as American degrees do not stand up to global data. In the “QS World University Rankings 2026,” U.S. institutions dominate the top tier, with MIT ranked #1 for the 13th consecutive year and over 40 U.S. universities in the top 200. By contrast, India’s highest-ranked school, IIT Delhi, sits at 123rd and most Indian universities fall far lower. The Times Higher Education 2025 rankings show a similar pattern: The U.S. holds 7 of the top 10 universities worldwide, while India’s best performer, IISc Bangalore, is ranked in the 201-250 band, with the majority falling 600+ or unranked. Quality concerns are reflected in employability data. Studies show that of Indian engineering graduates, approximately 94% lack the skills required for employment, with only 4.77% able to complete a basic programming task. These findings contrast sharply with Moritz’s assertion and raise questions about the pipeline that supplies roughly three out of every four H-1B visas. Opinion doesn’t conceal facts: Documented cases of replacement Moritz insists that U.S. companies do not hire H-1B workers “to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons.” But documented cases prove otherwise. In 2015, Disney made headlines when IT employees were ordered to train H-1B replacements supplied by HCL. At Southern California Edison, hundreds of American IT roles were cut and replaced with H-1B contractors. The University of California required career staff to train incoming HCL hires. AT&T, after a $3 billion tax cut, expanded its outsourcing partnerships, displacing more than 16,000 Americans and closing 44 call centers. At Bank of America, the company acknowledged requiring U.S. employees to train foreign replacements, calling it “essential for knowledge transfer.” One employee, Kevin Flanagan, took his own life after being forced to train his foreign replacement, underscoring the human toll of these practices. These are just a few of many verifiable cases, not anecdotes. They demonstrate a pattern in which American workers are displaced while visa pipelines remain open and expanding. It’s all about cheap labor, not ‘rare skills’ Supporters often frame H-1B hiring as access to rare, high-end talent. But the government’s own data shows otherwise. Employers must classify H-1B jobs under one of four prevailing wage levels: Level 1 is “entry level,” while Level 4 reflects senior, fully competent roles. Employer records reveal that 83% of H-1B registrations fall into Levels I and II, both below the U.S. median wage. In computer and mathematical jobs, the single largest category, 271,000 of 315,000 filings, were placed at these lowest levels. Even in business and finance, nearly 80% landed at Levels I and II. Across the top five job categories, as little as 14% were classified at Levels III and IV. If the program were truly about filling rare shortages, employers would be filing at higher wage levels. Instead, filings cluster overwhelmingly at the bottom. The data shows that the H-1B program functions as a pipeline for lower-cost labor on a massive scale. India’s government confirms: H-1B fuels exports, not shortages In a Bloomberg article titled “India Seeks Access for Workers in US Trade Talks After H1B Blow”, Indian officials openly acknowledge the real function of the H-1B program. India Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told U.S. negotiators that the “mobility of skilled workers” is vital to India’s services exports. In plain terms, the H-1B program is not being used to solve America’s skill shortages; it is a pipeline that converts U.S. jobs into India’s export product. And the vehicle making this possible is not trade law, but America’s own immigration system. The report also shows that India views Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee not as an obstacle to filling U.S. skill shortages, but as a direct threat to its $280-billion tech services industry. For American workers, the consequences are twofold. First, jobs are lost at home when companies bring in lower-cost visa holders. Second, those same roles are exported overseas under the banner of “services,” turning U.S. employment into an international commodity. The hard truth: The H-1B program fails to protect Americans Moritz argues that U.S. law protects citizens from being replaced by H-1Bs. In reality, the program is structured in ways that leave Americans exposed. Employers are generally not required to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1Bs. Only a narrow subset of “H-1B-dependent” employers face additional rules, and those rules contain significant loopholes. Mst companies simply attest that they will not displace U.S. workers in the exact same job classification. Nothing prevents them from laying off staff in one unit while filling nearly identical roles with H-1Bs through outsourcing vendors. The Department of Labor’s Inspector General has reported widespread fraud and abuse in the program and found oversight grossly insufficient. The result is a system where violations are frequent, consequences rare and displacement, both direct and indirect, widespread. Veiled threats: The implied ultimatum Moritz warns that “advances in technology mean that it is less important for the tech companies to bring workers to America,” implying that if the U.S. restricts visas, companies will simply take the work abroad. Such statements raise questions about corporate loyalty to their country, America. With U.S. consumers generating the majority of revenue, the suggestion that jobs can simply be shifted elsewhere overlooks the role of American workers and taxpayers in building these companies. If firms choose to move operations overseas, policymakers could require repayment of subsidies, grants and tax breaks and retention of patents developed with U.S. funding. Policy makers should also implement new policies on offshoring and safeguarding American data from being transferred abroad, where privacy protections are weak or unenforceable. Narrative capture disguised as innovation Michael Moritz argues that the Trump administration should not shrink the H-1B program but instead double or triple visa numbers and automatically grant U.S. citizenship to foreign nationals earning PhDs in STEM fields from top American universities. He frames this as essential to keeping top talent from leaving for other countries. However, proposals of this kind would expand the supply of foreign labor, lock in employer access to it and make it more difficult for policymakers to reduce numbers later. Each step strengthens corporate reliance on foreign workers rather than on the domestic labor force. When Moritz and others call for increasing visa numbers under the banner of “economic fundamentals,” the result is an expanded supply of lower-cost labor for corporations. In this framework, “innovation” becomes linked less to investing in American workers and more to enlarging the pool of foreign labor that can be brought in. \ Moritz also points to his own immigration story as evidence that visa pipelines should be widened. Even after nearly 50 years in the United States and despite clear benefits from the American economy, his framing suggests that assimilation and citizenship are optional. In this view, American loyalty and sovereignty take a back seat to profit. Being American in America appears conditional, valued only so long as it aligns with higher financial returns. If greater profits can be found elsewhere, America itself is presented as interchangeable, or even for sale. Moritz’s op-ed frames resistance as xenophobic, backward or disconnected from “global realities,” while presenting the movement of jobs abroad as the natural fallback. Yet America’s strength has historically come from deliberate design, sovereignty and investment in its own workforce. The fortunes of the investor class were built on this foundation, even as current arguments push in the exact opposite direction. Moritz portrays his stance as safeguarding talent, but the emphasis aligns consistently with safeguarding financial returns. Restoring America’s promise The debate over H-1B visas is not about talent, progress or global competitiveness. It is about whether the United States will continue to sell out its workers, its sovereignty and its future for the short-term profits of the investor class. Michael Moritz’s arguments highlight a worldview where citizenship, assimilation and American loyalty are treated as optional and where the nation’s worth is reduced to margins on a balance sheet. The United States and its citizens were never meant to be interchangeable with others. The country was built on purpose, pride and sacrifice. Its strength has always come from investing in its own people, defending its sovereignty and ensuring that opportunity belongs first to the citizens who built and sustained it. If America is to secure the next century, policymakers must stop treating the displacement of American workers as collateral damage and start addressing it as the true national emergency it is. Immigration policy must serve the interests of American citizens, not the balance sheets of multinational corporations or the export ambitions of foreign governments. The choice is to stand with American workers or surrender the nation’s future. To keep the United States free, strong and sovereign, its leaders must protect American jobs, innovation and people – because America is not for sale.

Good morning to everyone except the European Ryder Cup team! The biennial (that means every two years) golf tournament between the US and Europe tees off this morning right in NYC's backyard on Long Island. BI's Alice Tecotzky will be our boots on the ground today, so if you'll be at Bethpage, drop her a line. In other news, Amazon reached a record $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC to resolve a case over its Prime subscription practices, which were first reported on by Business Insider back in 2022. In today's big story, President Donald Trump approved a TikTok deal, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions. What's on deck: Markets: A quantum leap in trading just took place. Tech: The vibes on vibe coding are not great. Business: Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol is taking a page from his old playbook to overhaul the coffee giant. But first, TikTok's no longer on the clock. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. We've finally got a TikTok deal. The specifics of it are another question. President Donald Trump signed an executive order blessing TikTok's sale for roughly $14 billion, writes BI's Dan Whateley. The deal ends the threat of the divest-or-ban law hanging over the app's head since the beginning of the year. TikTok's new US era doesn't mean the questions surrounding its future will stop. In fact, Trump's executive order led to many more questions. One big one is who exactly is getting TikTok. While it will be a consortium of investors, the exact makeup of the group wasn't disclosed. Trump said "four or five world-class investors" are involved, including Michael Dell, Rupert Murdoch, and Larry Ellison. Oracle will also audit TikTok's all-important algorithm, according to an earlier statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. "What this deal ensures is that the American entity, the American investors, will actually control the algorithm," Vice President JD Vance said. Theoretically, TikTok users shouldn't expect any initial significant changes to their app. After all, the whole point of the deal was to keep things running smoothly, albeit in US control. But down the road, all bets are off. Here are three big questions that remain: What's going to happen to the algorithm? The app's powerful algorithm is the most valuable piece of TikTok and was a key factor in the divest-or-ban law. But with TikTok's split from parent company ByteDance, it's not entirely clear what the impact will be. Leavitt previously said the algorithm will be "retrained." Could users experience a downgrade in performance as a result? It's all happening as Instagram leans even harder into its short-form video. How about that equity? Another complexity from the TikTok-ByteDance split is what happens to US employees' equity in the latter. ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion in late August, according to one report. TikTok US, meanwhile, is being priced at around $14 billion for the deal, according to Vance. One group that's not worried about equity is the US government. Unlike other transactions it has been involved in, Uncle Sam won't take a stake in TikTok. Instead, it expects to receive a fee for brokering the deal. Where do things go on the business side? Following the announcement, some TikTok employees told BI they were concerned about whether their teams would be deprioritized or cut entirely. One area to watch is TikTok's e-commerce business, Shop. In recent years, TikTok has heavily invested in this area. However, things haven't been going according to plan. Social shopping hasn't been embraced by the US market like it has in Asia. Further complicating things is TikTok's recent promotion of Chinese executives to lead the business, which could be called into question as it looks to distance the company from China. 1. HSBC just achieved a major breakthrough in trading, and IBM played a key role. The bank successfully used IBM's technology to deploy a quantum computing-enabled strategy in the bond market. It's a sign of what the future of trading could look like by leveraging the cutting-edge tech. 2. There's stagflationary risk on the horizon. Macro research firm TS Lombard pointed out four reasons why the US could be headed for a dreaded stagflation scenario. It compared today's risks to the last stagflation crisis of the 1960s, when Fed policy missteps caused inflation to spike while economic growth stalled. 3. Qube is humanizing its quant hedge fund. The $34 billion firm is launching its first human fundamental analyst team on October 1, people close to the firm told BI. Under former Balyasny exec Stephen Irvine, each analyst will run a sleeve of capital between $200 million and $500 million. 1. Silicon Valley's defense of Trump's new visa fee. While Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee drew backlash from many in the tech industry, leaders like Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are making the case for it. Here's why. 2. There's a new battle in the war between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. In its latest iteration, Elon Musk's xAI has sued OpenAI, alleging that the company poached xAI staff to access trade secrets. An OpenAI spokesperson denied the allegations. "This new lawsuit is the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment," the OpenAI spokesperson told BI. 3. Vibe coding isn't dead, just … sleepy? New data from Barclays shows traffic on AI vibe coding sites, including favorites Lovable and Vercel's v0, is down from a summer peak. That raises questions about whether vibe coding is dead or just in a lull as the hype burns off. 1. A farewell to Starbs. Layoffs and store closures are coming to Starbucks, which said it's firing 900 non-retail employees and shuttering about 1% of its North American stores. That includes the iconic Capital Hill Roastery, which is just minutes from its Seattle headquarters. Here's how CEO Brian Niccol is repeating his Chipotle strategy at the coffee giant. 2. Another W for Costco. The wholesaler beat expectations with full-year revenue growth of 8.1%. Its bet on extended hours for executive members is paying off — CEO Ron Vachris said those hours have added an estimated 1% to weekly sales. 3. Hustling from MTV to the trading floor. Kim Stolz started out on "America's Next Top Model" before her career at MTV. Today, she advises ultrawealthy clients at Bank of America Private Bank. Stolz shared with BI how she knocked on doors to land her first gig on Wall Street. The former Netflix exec who oversaw 'Stranger Things' and 'Bridgerton' is becoming Amazon's new TV head. Read the memo. Uber is making new moves in the race to deliver fresh groceries fast. Cisco exec says the slowdown in entry-level hiring is a 'total blip' and won't last.

Title: I'm an Amazon software engineer who wasn't selected for the H-1B visa. I was obsessed with staying in the US‚ but not anymore.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Wen-Hsing Huang, a 25-year-old software development engineer at Amazon who's from Taiwan and is now in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Huang's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I always knew I wanted to study and work in the United States. When I was 18, I dreamed of making $200,000 a year working in Big Tech when I graduated. Over time, I began to question whether I wanted my career dictated by a visa. I realized how little control I had over external factors: the economy, layoffs, and visa policies. The only thing I could control was my response. That's why I'm not overly stressed about the latest H-1B visa updates. My experiences have made me resilient and given me a more mature mentality to overcome challenges. The new American dream isn't about staying in America; it's about using the skills, network, and savings you build here to create a life where you're not at the mercy of visas, layoffs, or politics. For me, that means returning home, building something of my own, and enjoying the freedom that comes with it. Do you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you. Please fill out this quick form. My original plan was to come to the US on an F-1 visa, study, and work on the Optional Practical Training program, which allows international students to work for a year after graduating — or up to three years if you're in STEM. It's a common path for international students to get their start in the US. I wanted to work for a company that could apply for a green card for me, work full time for five years, become a senior software engineer, and then pursue my dream of entrepreneurship, since I would have a better safety net and wouldn't need to worry about my visa. I'd work for another 10 to 20 years, achieve FIRE (financial independence, retire early), and retire at 40 years old. I studied very hard at National Central University in Taiwan, graduating at the top of my class. My English wasn't very good, but I worked hard enough to earn a spot in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign master's program in computer science. I arrived on an F-1 student visa in 2022, when there were mass tech layoffs at Meta, Twitter, and many other companies. Finding a summer internship was really difficult. Usually, that's the path to a full-time job, but I had no offers. I had borrowed $100,000 from my parents to study in the US, and they weren't that wealthy. If I didn't land a job after graduation, I would have to leave within 60 days, $100,000 in debt to my parents. I committed myself full time to finding a full-time job. I practiced my elevator pitch repeatedly, attended every career fair I could find, refined my coding skills and résumé, and applied to any opportunities I saw. My mental health was pretty terrible during that time, but it gave me good life experience and made me learn what I can and can't control in life. After graduating from my program, I landed a job at ASM, a semiconductor company in Arizona. Six months later, in September 2024, I joined Amazon, where I've been working ever since. At first, I was obsessed with staying in the US. I wanted a green card and was very afraid I wouldn't be able to stay. The turning point came in April 2025, when there was a lot of news about F-1 students being deported. I didn't get selected in the H-1B lottery for the second time and felt very uncertain and insecure. I'd planned a trip to Japan that month, and despite the news, I traveled because I realized I didn't care whether I stayed in the US or not. I'll have one more chance to apply for the H-1B visa next year before my OPT runs out, but I've already made peace with the possibility of leaving. Many people have an illusion of stability, but the world isn't stable, and neither is the economy. Layoffs can happen anytime. I believe AI will replace many jobs, including in software. These are some factors that pushed me to act with urgency and control my own life. I don't want to sacrifice my 20s trying to get this uncertain and illusory American dream. For three years, every major decision had to be filtered through "Will this affect my visa status?" rather than "Is this what I actually want to do?" I couldn't test business ideas, take entrepreneurial risks, or even travel freely without worrying about reentry. Now, my plan is different. I'll keep working at Amazon a while longer, save money, and return to Taiwan to start my own business. With the internet, borders matter less. I can register a company in the US, serve a global customer base, and earn US-level income while enjoying Taiwan's lower cost of living and better healthcare. Despite the challenging process, I'm still very grateful for my time in America. I earned my degree, gained Big Tech experience, broadened my perspective, and learned life's most important lessons: resilience — maintaining strength amid uncertainty — and finding my true values. I came here with deep admiration for a country that has always attracted adventurers in pursuit of freedom and opportunity, where, regardless of your background or where you come from, talent and perseverance matter more than origins. I believe that America still exists in spirit. But leaving means I can finally make decisions based on what I want to build rather than what my visa allows. I don't give advice to others; everyone has their own priorities. But for me, leaving the US isn't a failure. It's freedom. Have a story or tip?

Title: US lawmakers have questions for Big Tech and others on H-1B hiring practices

Two US senators have questions for Big Tech and other top companies over their use of H-1B visas amid the Trump administration's push to slow down foreign worker hiring practices. In letters sent to 10 companies on Wednesday, including Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said they were concerned about the use of H-1B visa workers while the tech sector experiences a "high unemployment rate." The senators cited the layoffs the companies conducted in recent years and the number of H-1B visas they applied for in 2025. In the letter addressed to Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, the senators wrote that Amazon had laid off "tens of thousands of employees in recent years" while it was approved to hire "at least 10,033 H-1B employees" in the latest fiscal year. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the letter said. Each letter contains eight questions regarding the company's foreign hiring practices, including whether a company has "displaced any American employees with H-1B employees." The letters were sent to Amazon, Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Walmart. Spokespeople for these companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The probe comes just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that implements a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B application. The initial unveiling of the H-1B overhaul sent companies scrambling to notify their foreign employees to get back to the US in under 24 hours. The White House later clarified that it was for new visas. Some business leaders, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, hailed the move as a necessary corrective to the existing process, while others said it could hurt smaller companies that can't afford $100,000 application fees. A JPMorgan Chase report published Tuesday said that the new fee could reduce the US work authorizations by 5,500 per month. Jump to
