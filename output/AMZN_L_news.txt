Title: Holiday hiring forecast to fall to 16-year low as tariffs force retail pullback

Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago. Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. “We are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they’re making to their workforce.” In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy’s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started. The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. “Radial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.” So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target said it’s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool. Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: JD Vance On Three Sunday Shows Is Three Times As Charming!

Time Published: 2025-10-13T14:31:26Z

JD Vance appeared on multiple Sunday shows this week. He was as charming, we mean off-putting and repellent, as ever. Let’s dive in! Beginning chronologically, Vance went on NBC to try his luck with Kristen Welker. If Vance was trying to prove he isn’t a sycophant, he failed almost immediately when he started by trying to chastise NBC News for not adequately praising King “MAGAbicho”: VANCE: But I also have to give your network a little bit of grief, Kristen, because last night I was watching NBC. They […] mentioned that during a rally last night in Israel, when Steve Witkoff, our great special envoy, mentioned Bibi Netanyahu the crowd booed. But the broadcast didn’t mention that when Steve Witkoff mentioned President Trump, the crowd actually cheered. And why is that, Kristen? Yes, and why didn’t the Nobel Committee make a one-time exception and give two Peace Prizes this year so Trump could have one? Waaah! (Netanyahu nominated Trump for a consolation prize today in Israel, don’t worry.) Subscribe! Later, the topic shifted to the GOP’s government shutdown, now hitting the two-week mark. Welker played a montage of Trump saying during the Obama years that it’s the president’s job to settle a shutdown. Confronted with a conflicting truth he can’t deny, again Vance opted for accidental honesty. VANCE: Well, Kristen, the president was talking back then when Barack Obama was president about the political realities. We are focused now on the governing realities because we’re in power. In other words, it was really easy to armchair quarterback how amazing a dealmaker he would have been when Obama was president, but now he’s in charge and finding out he sucks. Got it. Now that the GOP has given up on last week’s lie about “illegals getting healthcare” as their boogeyman during this shutdown, Vance has moved on to faux empathy for the people affected by it. VANCE: Well, I just think it shows the different priorities of Democrats and Republicans in the midst of these shutdowns. You really have to ask yourself, “Who do we care more about? Federal bureaucrats in Washington DC or low-income women getting the food benefits they deserve, our troops getting the payment they need, flood insurance across the Southeast in the midst of hurricane season?” Are you fucking serious right now? The GOP has cut $267 billion in SNAP benefits, plus further cuts in the Blowjobs For Billionaires Bill. The Education Department just wiped out the special education offices.Tthe Trump administration proposed FEMA making it harder to get federal disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. Trump just gave a $20 billion bailout to Argentina’s libertarian government while they undercut American soybean farmers. And they’ve proposed stiffing furloughed federal workers on their backpay. GTFOH. Vance tried his luck with Margaret Brennan. Brennan pushed Vance on the self-inflicted chaos of the Trump Administration’s layoffs. BRENNAN: CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that’s not the case. But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC? VANCE: […] First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job […] But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. […] BRENNAN: […] But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. As we frantically search for hazmat suits on Amazon, we certainly feel confident if another pandemic happens under these chucklefucks. Brennan asked about labor union legal challenges to these layoffs, and Vance’s central processing system began to deteriorate as he spat this out. VANCE: Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases. This is gibberish. Third time’s the charm? Nah! George Stephanopoulos asked Vance about Border Czar Tom Homan being caught on tape by the FBI accepting a $50,000 bribe. Vance refused to answer the question repeatedly, so Stephanopoulos ended the interview in the only manner appropriate: STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t insinuate anything. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000, as was heard on an audio tape recorded by the FBI in September 2024. You did not answer the question. Thank you for your time. VANCE: No, George, I sai-- STEPHANOPOULOS: We’ll be right back. Stuffing these losers into metaphorical lockers is the only way to treat them. Have a week.

Rising tariff costs and other economic factors are forcing retailers to pull back or even delay their plans to hire seasonal workers NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.

Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday mass firings of federal workers have started. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are selective. Analysts will also be watching how shoppers will react to price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compares with 4.2% last year. And Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Companies are increasingly wanting to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff. Radial is also training holiday hires faster with new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target will offer current workers additional hours and then will tap into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the largest private employer, has been offering its workers extra hours available during the holidays, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but most locations will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that with the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time. Meanwhile, the temporary halt of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about sales forecasts and the workers they may need. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Inside Blur, the Indie VFX Animation Studio ‘By Artists, for Artists’ That’s Defying the Odds

Time Published: 2025-10-13T13:15:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Co-founder and owner Tim Miller and president Nan Morales talk about why they prefer to stay small and the studio’s next phase Even if you have never heard of Blur Studio, you’ve definitely seen its work. The Culver City, Calif.-based animation and visual effects studio does it all — the production of the wildly successful “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies and the Emmy-nominated animated anthology series “Love, Death & Robots” (on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (on Prime Video); video game cut scenes for AAA titles like “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;” the jaw-dropping opening credits for David Fincher’s “Girl With the Dragon Tattoo:” and even the animation for Universal Studios’ The Simpsons Ride. Its 2004 animated short film “Gopher Broke,” directed by Jeff Fowler (who would go on to direct the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies), was nominated for an Oscar. Tim Miller, the company’s co-founder and owner, directed the first “Deadpool” movie and 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.” But perhaps more impressive than the output is its financial performance. Blur Studio is profitable and has never been in debt or had outside financing or loans against the company. It was founded in 1995 and has roughly 100 employees. In an interview with TheWrap, Miller described Blur as “a company built by artists, for artists, to create content that I feel like otherwise wouldn’t make it to screens, big and small.” Nan Morales, Blur’s president, added, “I also think we spent the last few years recruiting the best teams globally and we’re building the community for the visual work and storytelling.” Its success stands in stark contrast with most visual effects houses that have trouble remaining afloat. The challenges emerge from productions awarding jobs to the lowest-bidder, creating an untenable situation when projects stretch over months and filmmakers demand countless VFX iterations — the impact being massive blockbusters with poor CGI scenes and a rising number of visual effects houses closing. So how did Blur avoid this fate? “I would love to say that it’s all due to precise planning and pinpoint accuracy and focus. But a lot of it is luck,” Miller said. “We got into the games industry, which to some degree has been protected by tax incentives, and it’s an industry that we love, which is the luckiest thing. We get to work with these great partners on this cutting edge technology, on the kind of subject matter that, honestly, I always wanted to work on.” The tax incentives that protected video game production allowed Blur to stay in Los Angeles at a time when studios were fleeing to Vancouver or London. Although the video game industry isn’t immune to periods of decline, as sweeping layoffs have hit major game companies over the last few years. Which makes Blur’s diversification all the more important. Miller said that most of Blur’s output is “work for hire.” There are plenty of projects that Blur is developing in-house but they function primarily as a studio who is hired by outside companies – video game publishers and streaming studios – to create content for them. Blur then partners with other studios to make sure that all the work gets done. This approach also adds visual variety to projects, like the different art styles and aesthetics that populate both “Love, Death & Robots” (developed in-house by Blur and streaming on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (a project that originated with Sony’s video game division and streams on Prime Video). “When I started the studio, it was because I thought nobody would let me direct an animated film unless I actually owned a studio that could do it, which was my reason for building it,” Miller said. But he’s also thankful he has “Love, Death & Robots,” an R-rated animated anthology series full of sex and violence that Blur produces and which allows him to “hire our competitors in the game cinematic space.” “They’re all people that normally are competing for jobs against us, which is great because it’s this really tight community of really driven boutique studios where I think the best artists are. On ‘Love, Death & Robots,’ we’ll do two or three episodes every season. And for now, for ‘Secret Level,’ we’ll do two or three episodes ourselves, and then we spread the love around.” When Miller started Blur in the 1995, the same year that Pixar released the first feature-length computer animated film “Toy Story,” he wanted to be “the dark Pixar and build this big company.” Los Angeles was the epicenter for the emerging computer animation movement. Now? “That’s not so much my goal,” Miller said. “It’s not sustainable,” Morales said of making that dream a reality. “We’re not seeing a business practice that that’s a sustainable market. We’re a small, boutique shop. We’re like 100 employees. People think we’re huge. We’re not. That’s why we have to have our vendor partners and seek out the best people that are out there.” Blur is an animation studio that develops projects and animates parts of those projects but also partners with other studios to complete the work. Blur might animate an entire opening title sequence or video game cinematic, but on larger, more complex projects like “Love, Death & Robots,” they’ll work with other studios to bring most of the segments to life. And on even the biggest projects, like the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies (and the Paramount+ spinoff series “Knuckles”), studios like MPC and Industrial Light & Magic also worked on the effects and animation. It used to be that animation studios would do all the work for a single project, but it’s becoming more commonplace for a studio to work on most of the animation while also farming out different sections. DreamWorks Animation’s recent “The Bad Guys 2,” for example, had some key sequences handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Blur was quietly ahead of the curve. The work is having an impact on the industry. Morales talked about a small studio Blur worked with that was flying under the radar but was able to hire 150 people for a big job because of its work on “Secret Level.” “These boutique shops are doing quite well from ‘Secret Level’ and ‘Love Death & Robots,’ in the sense that their work is being shown globally,” Morales said. She added that this work keeps other studios from faltering. “2024 was awful,” Morales said. “I came into a huge dip in the economy for trailers and cinematics and even content. It just died out. In 2025, we did okay, and hopefully we keep going forward, it’s a struggle for everyone out there. And I’m really happy the way we have built a community of sharing, trying to help everyone stay afloat. It’s not the big companies, it’s the small companies that have to stand around, to make it competitive out there.” But while keeping Blur small makes the economics of the company work in its favor, Miller also has a creative reason for doing so. “My reason for the size of the company, is I realized I’m selfish, and running a big company doesn’t excite me as much as doing the work,” Miller said. “The only reason to be that big would be to get rich. And that doesn’t interest me nearly as much as making stuff.” Miller said that the model that they’ve worked out, where they collaborate with their partners and friends, is ideal. That way, when they come off of a show, they aren’t forced with cutting payroll or hours or employees just to stay afloat. “I’m working on a new idea to split the difference between a loose alliance of sorts that might help all the problems that these smaller studios face,” Miller teased. “But do I think about being a big behemoth? Those days might be over.” A major disrupter is entering the industry in the form of AI, with its magical promises of being able to produce entire animated films and cut the need for human creatives significantly (which so far, haven’t been fulfilled). But the process has an uncanny ability to mimic actual art, as was seen by the wave of Hayao Miyazaki rip-offs that flooded social media earlier this year. In June, Miller was on a panel at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival where other speakers were “dancing around the issue.” He dove right in. “I was like, ‘Why are you guys talking like this thing may go away or it may not be a factor or if we close our eyes, it might not exist? It’s not going to happen.’” In the past, any new technology or tool that would come along, Miller and other creatives in the field would jump on it, “because it would increase my creative abilities.” Not when it comes to AI. “I’ve seen a real resistance to the AI tools, and I get it, it feels like an existential threat to their jobs, and by extension, their families and their lives. I think that’s a very justified and real concern for the industry. I understand the terror, but it means that people stay away from it, and they cover their eyes and pretend it doesn’t happen,” Miller said, noting he would rather be in control of the technology than leave it to a large corporation. Miller and Blur had developed an adaptation of English author China Miéville’s 2000 novel “Perdido Street Station” at Amazon, which is no longer moving forward. The project was, in Miller’s estimation “incredibly complicated – lots of characters and creatures and everything.” The property was decidedly “not for kids” and would have been “prohibitively expensive to make with the traditional tools.” “But AI gives us a chance at using the efficiencies that it could bring to all parts of the pipeline to tell a story at a cost that it can afford to not be for 11-year-olds,” Miller said. “That kind of s–t gives me hope. It shouldn’t cost $200 million to make a movie.” “It’s innovation of tools,” Morales said of AI. “It’s not replacing the artist … As a tool base to allow us some more latitude and be able to create environments that aren’t key elements to a storytelling, I think people will accept that, and it will help us bring more stories to the public.” Not that she’s totally sold. She recently saw some AI-generated “content” (her word) and she found it wanting. “It’s not very visually pleasing,” Morales said. Miller was reluctant to get in a debate about what AI can or can’t do, because it might be able to do something that we don’t even know about yet. Still, it’s enough for Miller to quote Arthur C. Clarke – “the future is not only stranger than you imagine, it’s stranger than you can imagine.” “I feel a bit of that right now,” Miller admitted. “I personally believe that for the next 12 months, our plan is to not replace our pipeline. It’s about what parts of the process can we make better and more efficient. On the production side, being able to look at the data of how we do things and how long it takes and where we put our focus is as important as the actual pixel manipulation.” One thing that has remained slightly out of reach for Miller and the team at Blur has been the production of an animated feature. Morales said that the company can “definitely do” an animated feature and Miller said, “We have to work with our partners.” He said that “The Goon” — a graphic novel adaptation that Blur Studio and David Fincher have been trying to get off the ground since 2008 — had recently been set up at Netflix. It took a year to put the deal together. And a month after they signed the agreement, Netflix told them, “We’re not going to do adult animated features anymore.” “I’m like, Oh my God, f–king kill me,” Miller said. It just made him more determined to make it himself. Miller said that he’s sympathetic to what happens to these movies at studios, but Blur is always seemingly caught in those corporate crosshairs. “We’ve got so much cool stuff developed and then somebody leaves and the new person doesn’t like it or somebody doesn’t have the power to push it through,” he said. “Love, Death & Robots,” for instance, initially started life as a reboot of the animated anthology film “Heavy Metal,” based on the American comic book magazine known for its bleak, but visually lush, sci-fi, fantasy and horror elements. Miller had some amazing directors lined up to direct individual segments, including Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Zack Snyder, Guillermo del Toro and James Cameron. But after more than a decade, he pivoted and turned it into a television series, which has now had 45 episodes and received multiple Emmy wins, and remains one of the most exciting animated series currently streaming. Morales said that when she came to Blur, “I could see the future and the animation space filling in the live-action, tentpole movie space, when studios are looking at $200 million+ and I know in animation we could do that for a lot less and give them the same quality.” She points to the “Warhammer” episode of “Secret Level,” which is just as tense and thrilling as any live-action feature, rendered gorgeously (and in a video game engine, no less) for a fraction of the cost of, say, the latest Marvel Studios movie. “When I walked in the first day and talked to Tim and saw ‘Warhammer,’ I said, ‘That’s the future. That’s the future of big movies,” Morales said. “We have to embrace that and show that skill.’ And I think Blur can lead that charge for a lot of people. We’re seeing the ability to do it right now. It’s just actually putting it out there.” Using a video game engine to make an entire animated feature, or even part of an animated feature, would be a breakthrough, but the world of visual effects has been embracing the technology over the past few years. The most notable example of this is The Volume, the virtual stage system that Industrial Light & Magic developed and first employed on Lucasfilm’s Disney+ streaming series “The Mandalorian.” The technology, dubbed StageCraft, utilizes real-time computing and video game engines to create animated backdrops and star-fields live on set, instead of using a blue or green screen and filling it in later. And it’s being employed on movies that don’t take place in a galaxy far, far away, most recently on the Colin Farrell/Margot Robbie romantic fantasy “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” which debuted last month. Maybe the biggest challenge Miller faces, he said, is the “big group of people who just don’t like animation.” “They’re not going to come inside the tent. But if we can get across the uncanny valley, and I do think we’re almost there, then that opens up a whole different world of stories for animation,” Miller said. “It opens up a whole different demo of people who will watch the content because it looks like live action, or close enough to live action that it’ll get us across. I mean, video games did a lot to bring people into the adult animation tent.” About 15 years ago, a trailer surfaced for an adaptation of Eric Powell’s beloved comic book series “The Goon.” The brief clip, directed by Miller, was visually inventive and a loving reinvention of the source material. An eventual movie, produced by Fincher, was proposed, with a Kickstarter campaign launched to cover necessary pre-production costs. But the latest setback at Netflix hasn’t deterred Miller. Maybe, with the right tools, he says, it can finally see the light of day instead of remaining on Blur’s perpetual to-do list. “I don’t give up,” Miller said. “I never give up.” And you tend to believe him.

Title: H-1B visa crackdown not an existential threat to TCS; CEO Krithivasan says firm 'can survive'

Amid the uncertainty around H-1B visas, Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) K Krithivasan has opened up about the IT giant's view on the work visa, restrictions on which, introduced by US President Donald Trump, have rocked the industry. Krithivasan's comments take on particular importance, with TCS being the second-biggest beneficiary of the H-1B programme in 2025 after Amazon, with over 5,000 H-1B visas approved in 2025 alone. In an interview with Business Standard, Krithivasan addressed not just concerns regarding the work visa, but also spoke about the company's recent move to lay off 12,000 people globally. On the back of the layoffs, US Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin had raised questions about the company hiring over 5,500 H-1B workers, which the tech CEO addressed directly in the interview. Commenting on facing questions from US Senators, Krithivasan said, "I was neither happy nor unhappy. It gave me an opportunity to articulate our positions more clearly and to address the Senators’ questions about the H-1B issue." Explaining that the "figure of 5,500" pertained to people amending or renewing their H-1B petitions, the TCS CEO said that fresh applications were much lower, "probably around 2,500". "We have 31,000 to 32,000 employees in the US, of whom only 11,000 to 12,000 are on H-1B visas, while the rest are on other types of visas. We have been progressively increasing local workforce participation, which will continue because the way of work has changed with new kinds of projects and AI coming into play, where you need to work closely with the customer and need different skill sets," Krithivasan was quoted as saying. "It is not just about engineering skills anymore; there is a growing demand for creative thinking and prompt engineering skills. In FY26, we sent just 500 people from India to the US on H-1B visas, which means we can survive without them (H-1B visas). There is no dependence on H-1B visas," the TCS CEO, most notably, said. "There was a time when this was a significant retention policy, but over the past four-five years, it has been on a declining trend. It is now far less of a retention policy than it once was, and we should not be assessing today’s scenario through yesterday’s lens," he added. When quizzed about the mass layoffs at TCS, Krithivasan explained that only two categories of employees had been affected: those on the bench for three to six months, and those who were underperforming. "I don’t believe the Tata group, while humane, would have retained employees with performance issues," the chief of the IT giant was quoted as saying. He also explained that a "skill mismatch" also contributed to some of the layoffs. "We have relieved individuals where we see a skill mismatch for the future. The company is pivoting to be future-ready and a big player in the AI ecosystem. If someone doesn’t fit into the scheme of things, we need to exit them gracefully. This approach, I believe, does not conflict with our ethos," Krithivasan said. The Trump administration, which has described the H-1B programme as the one of the "most abused visa" systems in the US' immigration framework, recently slapped a $100,000 ( ₹88 lakh) fee on fresh applications, sending shockwaves across firms that rely on the programme to employ highly-skilled talent from around the world.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ian Carter, a 33-year-old job seeker in Redmond, Washington, who previously worked as a technical program manager at Microsoft. It has been edited for length and clarity. On May 13, I was getting lunch at a Panera Bread when I just happened to check my email. When I read it, it felt like a gut punch. I'd been laid off from my Microsoft job. My mind started racing. Could I have done something different? Could I have been better? However, I eventually realized it was simply a business decision. I'd seen the company lay off a lot of people in recent years, and it felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not — everybody was at risk. When I was laid off, I was on medical leave for a personal health issue and had been planning to return to work in the coming days. I collected my last paycheck in mid-July and then received some severance pay, but I started applying for jobs almost immediately. My mindset was "I can cry while I apply." I decided to share that I'd been laid off on LinkedIn, and the post received over 115,000 impressions. I began receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities, and I've landed interviews at companies that include Disney and Nintendo. But it's now been five months since my layoff, and I'm still looking for a job. I've been drawing on my savings to pay the bills and renting my one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month lease for about $2,700 — all while crossing my fingers that I land a role soon. My lease ends the week of October 20, and if I don't have a job offer by then, I'm planning to move across the country to Florida to live with my family and save money until I find a job. Rent is expensive, but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: If I had to guess why I, along with many others at Microsoft and other Big Tech companies, have been laid off in recent years, I'd point to two factors: overhiring during the pandemic and massive investments in AI. Whatever the reason, it's clear that finding a job in tech has become significantly more difficult. Before my layoff, I regularly heard from college students struggling to break into the industry. The market already seemed tougher than when I graduated — and now, I'm seeing that firsthand. I'm in a spot where I have nearly four years of full-time experience — not quite a new grad, but not senior level, either. I think some companies are looking for one or the other, which has made my search harder. Others are seeking very specific skill sets, while mine can sometimes be viewed as more generalist. As I've searched for work, I've been trying to develop my AI skills, as job postings suggest that companies are increasingly valuing this expertise. Working at Microsoft also gave me insight into the value of AI skills. During my last year, I didn't personally feel that my performance expectations had risen too much, but I did feel some pressure to find ways to incorporate AI into my work. During my job search, I've tried to replicate the strategies that got me to this point in my career. I dropped out of high school in 2009 for health-related reasons, but I eventually earned my GED and enrolled at a community college, where I earned my associate degree and then went on to attend Florida State University. During this period, I built my network on LinkedIn — I now have more than 8,700 followers — which helped me secure interviews and ultimately land an internship at Salesforce. A company recruiter reached out to me, which is how I learned about the role and landed an interview. Having the internship on my résumé helped me land full-time interviews after graduation. I had a list of dream companies — including Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix — and I applied to a program manager role at Microsoft without a referral. After an interview, I eventually received a job offer. In 2021, I graduated from Florida State with a bachelor's degree in computer science and began working remotely for Microsoft due to the pandemic. In 2022, I moved to Redmond, Washington — where the company is headquartered — and before I was laid off, I had a six-figure salary. As I've searched for work — targeting program manager, project manager, and product management roles — I've tried to rely on my existing network and make new connections. When I see a role that interests me, I reach out to the recruiter or someone with a similar job title at the company and ask what they think their company is looking for in a candidate. I then tailor my résumé accordingly. Since I have a LinkedIn Premium account, I have more visibility into who views my profile. If they have an interesting job title, I'll send them a message. Most of the time, they respond because they recall visiting my page, which leads to a conversation. When I connect with people, I usually ask for advice rather than a referral. But if someone offers to give me one, I gladly accept. While these connections have helped me land some interviews, I'm still looking for a job offer. Going forward, my plan is to continue doing what I'm doing — applying for jobs, networking as much as possible, and developing my AI skills. However, if my job search drags on, I might consider pursuing a graduate degree, such as an MBA or a degree related to AI. In addition to networking for job opportunities, I've also reached out to others who've been laid off to discuss our shared experiences. Layoffs take a mental toll, and it's nice to talk to people who can relate. I sometimes visit the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout the company's history. It's always interesting to read about what others are going through and their stories. It makes me feel like I'm not alone. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Let’s give the ‘fired’ label a rest
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/11/why-its-time-move-on-from-the-word-fired-restructuring-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-10-11T13:10:00Z
Full Content:
Here are some eye-opening numbers: Last year, nearly 20 million Americans got pink slips. By June of this year, 10 million employees had been dismissed from a range of industries and companies, including blue-chip tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as once secure federal agencies. A whopping 1.6 million workers are laid off each month. Losing your job is a perpetually looming threat: 40% of American workers report being terminated at least once in their careers; most of them were taken by surprise. Those numbers are just as bad — and often worse — for those at the top. Recruiters tell us an estimated 40%-60% of senior executives are forced out, in part due to today’s record high turnover of CEOs. Regardless of title or income, the same label is applied (and self-applied) to people who’ve lost their jobs: You’ve been “fired.” Words matter. And the word “fired” implies fault — your fault. While some employees are let go for performance or behavior, millions more are caught in restructurings, downsizings, and strategic shifts spurred by investor and marketplace pressures. This cuts across corporate America, whether you’re on the shop floor, in middle management, or in the C-suite. No one is immune. We live in a churn economy of routine mass layoffs and restructurings that didn’t plague the generations of workers who retired before the 1980s. Leanne’s parents collectively spent over 40 years at Boeing; Nina’s father spent 30 years at Hughes Aircraft. Our parents’ generation could count on stability, security, predictability — and profound corporate loyalty that cut both ways. One study found that 58% of Fortune 100 companies announced layoffs in 2023, while in 1979 only 5% did. Back then, being “fired” was shorthand for showing unproductive, ill-fitting, or unethical workers the door — preferably before they stole the stapler. There are still plenty of employees who earned their pink slip fair and square. Performance and integrity issues? That’s on them. We shouldn’t shy away from holding employees accountable. But in today’s turbulent economy, the vast majority of displaced workers aren’t fired because of personal failure. More than ever before in modern times, people’s careers are fragile, unpredictable, and subject to pressures beyond their control. The personal toll of job loss is enormous. We’ve been fortunate to work with some of the most exceptionally talented and visionary business leaders around. And even among these super achievers, a job loss shakes confidence and self-worth, threatening to erase in their own minds years of well-earned impact and success. “Executives know the exit isn’t really about them,” says executive coach Nicole Didda. “They’ve got the performance, the reviews, the credibility. Still, the word ‘fired’ hits hard. Especially for women, it undermines confidence, making them feel ‘less than’ even when they know better.” That damaging psychic weight of insecurity and self-blame seeps into our society and politics, where polls show a stubborn and longtime trend of declining faith in a better future. No wonder, when 81% of workers in 2025 fear job loss. With an unsettling sense that control has slipped away, there’s a tendency for even the most talented and accomplished employees to self-identify as “fired” — even when the cause of their dismissal is a slowdown in the market. Poking fun at oneself for being let go may build connection, but it also undermines confidence, credibility, and faith in a better future. These economic forces aren’t going to change, especially with AI bringing its own uncertainty and job disruption. All the more reason we need to reframe the narrative around job loss. If almost half the workforce has experienced a job elimination, shouldn’t we give the word “fired” a rest? Let’s be more thoughtful — and understanding — in the way we treat our colleagues (and ourselves) when describing workplace departures. Let’s replace “fired” with something like: “freed for what’s next.” Let’s make the increasingly frequent business of moving on less dramatic, and a whole lot more human.

The center-left SPD, part of Germany's ruling coalition, says detaining failed asylum seekers indefinitely would be unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Germany is rolling out the EU's new Entry/Exit System. Follow DW for more. The Social Democrats (SPD) have censured a plan proposed by Germany's conservatives to detain rejected asylum seekers indefinitely, particularly when they have committed a crime or were deemed a security risk. Düsseldorf Airport is the first border entry point in Germany to introduce the EU's new Entry/Exit System for non-EU nationals. Germany's top trade unions have accused the government of hurting workers and warned employers not to make staff bear the cost of economic troubles. And while the far-right Alternative for Germany party retains the largest support among voters, the ruling coalition has seen a rise in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Below is a roundup of top headlines from Germany over the weekend of October 11 and 12: Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said the government will re-examine a partial embargo on the supply of weapons to Israel. For more on Germany's policy toward arms exports to Israel, visit our Middle East blog. Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million ($116 million) to help in the reconstruction of Gaza, German Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan said Sunday. The exact amount is yet to be determined. Read more about Germany's pledge for the reconstruction of Gaza in DW's Middle East blog. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is seeking a consensus among the leaders of the ruling coalition on the multi-billion-euro savings plan needed to balance the 2027 federal budget. Klingbeil also serves as vice chancellor. "We have already started this process," he said in an interview to broadcaster ARD on Sunday, adding that he hopes a package of measures will be ready around the turn of the year. The coalition intends to present a comprehensive package that would achieve about €34 billion ($39.5 billion) in savings, according to the minister, who leads the junior coalition partner Social Democrats (SPD). Klingbeil emphasized that the package must be seen as fair. He said the plan will likely focus on social services, long-term care, pensions and healthcare. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's governing coalition is led by his conservative CDU/CSU alliance. In August, Merz said that Germany's welfare state "can no longer be financed." German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday drew attention to the nearly 700 million people worldwide suffering from hunger. The United Nations has set the goal of a world without hunger by 2030 and, speaking at an event in Berlin marking Welthungerhilfe Week (World Hunger Aid Week), Steinmeier said: "We must not fail on the way there, despite all the setbacks that unfortunately exist." The aid week is an annual campaign organized in Germany by the humanitarian Welthungerhilfe (WHH) organization to raise awareness of global hunger. Ten years ago, the UN set the goal of a world without hunger for 2030, but this objective is unlikely to be met. According to a UN report published in July 2025, about 673 million people suffered from hunger last year, around 8% of the world's population. The report stated this was a slight decrease compared with 2023 (8.5%) and 2022 (8.7%). In his speech, Steinmeier pointed to the causes of hunger, citing wars and climate change. Steinmeier is a German politician who has served as Germany's president since 2017. Germany's president serves as the head of state, but the role is mainly ceremonial. Voters in the eastern German city of Frankfurt an der Oder chose an independent over the Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate on Sunday, blocking what would have been the far-right party's first urban win in a mayoral election. Axel Strasser won with 69.8% of the vote against AfD candidate Wilko Möller, according to preliminary results. Turnout was 49.4%. In the first round on September 21, Strasser received 32.4% of the vote and Möller 30.2%, while candidates from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SDP) were eliminated. Frankfurt an der Oder is in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, located directly on the border with Poland. It is distinct from Frankfurt am Main, the much larger financial hub in western Germany. Frankfurt an der Oder is the fourth-largest city in Brandenburg with around 57,000 residents. The AfD is classified as right-wing extremist by the Brandenburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Slightly fewer people attended this year's Cannstatter Wasen Volksfest in Stuttgart, with about 4.2 million visitors recorded over 17 days compared to 4.6 million last year, organizers said Sunday. The drop followed a record turnout in 2023. "We had a festival with less-than-ideal weather conditions," said Andreas Kroll, managing director of the in.Stuttgart events company. Despite the cool, variable weather conditions, he said the atmosphere remained positive and the safety plan worked well. On October 3 and again on Saturday, police briefly closed access to the grounds due to overcrowding. Police described the festival as largely peaceful, even though reported crimes rose by about 20% compared to last year. "We saw more offenses against emergency personnel but fewer thefts and property damage," said Jörg Schiebe of the Bad Cannstatt police. He added that while there was "a higher level of aggression," incidents remained low given the large crowds. The Cannstatter Volksfest is widely considered to be the second-largest beer celebration in the world after the Munich Oktoberfest. Police in northeastern Germany said they have received new leads into the disappearance of an 8-year-old boy who went missing two days ago. The youngster, who was identified by his first name, Fabian, went missing from the town of Güstrow in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Friday. According to the police, the boy had left his mother's house with permission, possibly to see his father, who lives in another town. He did not return afterward. A police spokeswoman told DPA news agency that they had received additional tip-offs overnight into Sunday, adding they were examining bus video footage among other potential evidence. "There is no indication of a crime," the spokeswoman said. Police planned to conduct further interviews in the boy's neighborhood on Sunday, having used sniffer dogs the previous day to trace the boy's steps. Güstrow, a town with a population of 30,000, is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Rostock. The European Union began the gradual rollout of a new border entry system for non-EU nationals, which could lead to longer processing times at border entry points. From Sunday, non-EU nationals will be required to register their biometric data, including fingerprints and facial images when entering the bloc. The so-called Entry/Exit System (EES) will be required once every three years. The rule doesn't affect EU nationals or those holding residence cards for member states. Amid concerns that the new process could lead to long delays at border checkpoints, several EU countries have opted for a phased roll-out. Germany, for example, will introduce the EES at the northwestern Dusseldorf Airport first, before the system is expanded to larger airports in Frankfurt and Munich and later to external sea borders. The EES is the first step in a new EU border system. In late 2026, a paid travel authorization is to become mandatory for non-EU nationals who do not require a visa. Germany's ruling coalition of CDU/CSU conservatives and left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) has seen a modest rebound in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Some 28% of respondents said they were satisfied with the government's performance, up five points from three weeks ago. Approval for Chancellor Friedrich Merz personally rose to 27%, a gain of four points. The poll was conducted by Insa this week for Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Even so, a majority (63%) of Germans surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the government and 62% disapproved of Merz himself. If a parliamentary election were held on Sunday, the governing coalition would collectively reach just 38%, short of a majority in parliament. The moderate conservative bloc would gain 24% of the vote, while the SPD would reach 14% The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) retains the largest single-party support at 26%. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have hit out at a proposal by their conservative coalition partners to reform deportation procedures for failed asylum seekers in Germany. The plan by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt would allow authorities to detain rejected asylum seekers for an unlimited period, especially those who have committed crimes or pose a threat to security. Dobrindt's proposal comes as the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, seeks to speed up deportations across the 27-member bloc. Andy Grote, the SPD's Interior Senator for the state of Hamburg, told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that "an indefinite detention without the prospect of actual deportation would undoubtedly be unconstitutional." The interior ministries of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Lower Saxony also raised constitutional concerns. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Grote, who is a spokesperson for all SPD-led state-level interior ministries, said the key to increasing the deportation rate would be found by simplifying rules on returning rejected asylum seekers to the EU state they first entered. Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that Dobrindt's proposal also includes the deportation of Syrian nationals whose asylum applications had been rejected. They would be banned from returning to Germany for social visits. The proposal was, however, backed by Siegried Lorek, Baden-Württemberg's State Secretary for Migration, who said: "When it comes to repatriation, we are particularly focused on repeat and intensive offenders, as well as those who pose a threat." Guten Morgen from the banks of the Rhine River in Bonn. Our blog will keep you updated on the latest developments in Germany over the weekend, including: We will also be offering in-depth analysis on selected topics of German politics and society. Several people were injured in a shooting in a marketplace in the town of Giessen in the state of Hesse in central Germany, according to reports. Read more about the incident here. Berlin police have launched an investigation after two cases of graffiti vandalism were reported early on Saturday in the city's government district. Around 6:50 a.m. (0450 UTC), officers discovered orange paint markings — including a circle with a dot and an overturned euro symbol — on a low wall outside a Bundestag office building on Unter den Linden. While police were documenting the damage, Bundestag security reported similar graffiti on a construction site banner near the Brandenburger Tor S-Bahn station. The State Security Division of Berlin's criminal police is leading the investigation into both incidents. A roughly 2,000-year-old Roman silver treasure has been revealed near Borsum in the Hildesheim district of northern Germany, the Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung has reported. According to the paper, a metal detectorist found the hoard in 2017 but kept it hidden for years before turning it over to police in April. Sebastian Messal, an archaeologist and regional director at the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation, said the discovery is of "enormous scientific importance." So far, about 450 silver coins, several silver bars, a gold ring and a gold coin have been recovered. The items are believed to date from the first century AD, Germany's DPA news agency said. Messal said the size of the hoard puts it "among the top five, perhaps top three, finds in Lower Saxony." Prosecutors in Hildesheim had opened an embezzlement investigation against the 31-year-old finder but later dropped the case due to the statute of limitations. The man said he initially hid the treasure at home out of fear of legal consequences. Archaeologists have since excavated the site and uncovered additional coins. Messal's team hopes the find will shed new light on life and trade in the Hildesheim region during the early Roman Empire. It remains unclear whether the treasure was buried by Romans or looted by Germanic tribes. Prosecutors are seeking a venue change for a possible new rape trial against the German man suspected in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The Braunschweig public prosecutor's office has asked the Federal Court of Justice to overturn the man's October 2024 acquittal and hold a new trial at the Göttingen regional court, spokesman Hans Christian Wolters told the DPA news agency. The goal, he said, is to ensure an impartial handling of the case. Last year, a Braunschweig court acquitted the 48-year-old of multiple sexual assaults in Portugal, citing insufficient evidence. Prosecutors have appealed the decision, and Germany's highest civil and criminal court is now reviewing it for legal errors. The defense has called the acquittal the only correct outcome. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison sentence with subsequent preventive detention. The Göttingen court has not previously been involved in the case. It remains unclear when the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig will issue a ruling. The man, a convicted sex offender, has drawn international attention because German investigators suspect him of involvement in the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal. He has not been charged in that case and is presumed innocent. The 48-year-old was released from prison last month after serving a separate sentence for rape in Portugal.

Title: Intel slashes open-source contributions in the name of competiton

Intel has had a reputation for contributing to and benefiting from the open-source community, with contributions ranging from the RISC-V architecture to open-source Linux drivers for its Arc iGPUs and more recent gaming-grade dGPUs. It seems as though much of this will soon come to an end, though, according to Phoronix's reporting on recent comments from the company's Data Center Group executive vice president and general manager, Kevork Kechichian. According to Kechichian, Intel will seemingly no longer be contributing to open-source projects unless that contribution benefits Intel directly and "gives us a competitive edge against everyone else." "We need to find a balance where we use [our open-source software] as an advantage to Intel and not let everyone else take it and run with it." "We are very proud of our open-source contributions. We are going to keep on doing that. However, like I mentioned, I want to make sure that it gives us an edge against everyone else." –Kevork Kechichian (via Phoronix) Further comments by the Intel executive indicated that Intel may refrain from contributing to open-source projects altogether if it thinks that those contributions could help the competition. This announcement also follows Intel's July abandonment of Clear Linux, which was a performance-oriented Linux distribution that Intel had been developing for over 10 years. The new stance on open-source contributions runs counter to the generally accepted ethos of open-source, which is something akin to "a rising tide raises all ships," where everyone benefits from open-source contributions and there is a reciprocal relationship. With Intel's new strategy, it seems as though the company will be trying to use the open-source community as a resource to regain its lost competitive edge instead of contributing in good faith. The shift in Intel's open-source strategy appears to simply be the latest sign of the company's struggling to compete with both AMD and Nvidia, especially given the context of Kechichian's statements when it comes to Intel needing to ensure a competitive edge. Repeated setbacks, delays, and technical issues, both relating to CPU and GPU architecture and Intel's foundry efforts are exemplary of Intel's lack of competitive offerings, and this open-source shift appears to simply be the latest symptom of Intel's failings, even if Panther Lake shows some signs of improvement. The statements also follow Intel's recent layoffs that apparently affected maintainers of Intel's Linux kernel drivers. Intel's effective abandonment of open-source and the ethos behind open-source is further complicated by how much open-source code is used in many corporate projects, especially when it comes to AI projects. If you're on the market for a new SFF Linux gaming box, Intel might not be the best bet, so check out the likes of the Asus ROG Flow Z13 2-in-1 laptop — check out our review for more information — with an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (curr. $2,169.99 on Amazon).

Title: How AMD’s AI Software Helped It Score The Multi-Billion Dollar OpenAI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/10/09/amd-openai-chip-software/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T10:30:05Z

ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Whenever Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AI at the chip giant AMD, gives CEO Lisa Su an update on the progress of the company’s software efforts, she always has the same response: “Great job. You need to go faster.” It may seem unusual for a semiconductor company to put such an emphasis on software, but that’s what unlocks the power of the coveted chips that undergird the AI industry. They coax better performance from the silicon and optimize functionality. They allow engineers to operate and program the hardware. More importantly, they’re sticky: when engineers at a company learn how to use a chipmaker’s software platform, they can be hard pressed to learn another. According to Boppana, software is part of what helped AMD to score one of the biggest victories in its more than 50 year history: a multibillion dollar deal that will see ChatGPT maker OpenAI use AMD’s MI450 chips to power 6 gigawatts of compute for its popular AI products. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will be able to buy up to 160 million shares, or 10%, of AMD. The partnership is a massive boon for AMD as it tries to catch up to market leader Nvidia. The foundation of the deal dates back to 2023 when OpenAI first began running some of its models on AMD hardware. In the ensuing years, AMD would seek the AI giant’s counsel on the design of its forthcoming MI450 chips. OpenAI has also influenced AMD’s software, Boppana told Forbes. “As our relationship with OpenAI deepened, we've expanded the engagements across all portions of stack, but certainly on the software side,” said Boppana. For example, AMD worked with OpenAI to make Triton, OpenAI’s open-source language for programming GPUs, compatible with AMD chips. (Previously, it only supported Nvidia GPUs.) “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia.” The AMD-OpenAI deal comes as demand for compute power has become almost insatiable. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank announced Project Stargate, a $500 billion investment in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure. Apple made a similar $500 billion commitment weeks later. The AI frenzy has turned Nvidia, previously mostly known for gaming chips, into a $4.5 trillion behemoth. Late last month, OpenAI entered into a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia to power 10 gigawatts of compute. Meanwhile, a new generation of semiconductor startups, including Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, and d-Matrix, have sought to develop specialized chips for the AI era, optimizing for those workloads instead of the more generalized approach favored by the legacy players. The explosion of AI services in the past few years means it won’t be winner-takes-all when it comes to compute power, said Sid Sheth, CEO of d-Matrix. “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia,” he told Forbes. “Customers are now willing to go through the process of learning what it takes to work with AMD’s software.” For Nvidia, software has long been seen by industry observers as a powerful tool to keep it entrenched in the market. CUDA, Nvidia’s programming software, for example, has created a formidable moat when it comes to training AI models. But when it comes to inference, or the computing it takes to actually run the models, the barrier is lower because it’s a less complicated process. And that’s what OpenAI plans to use the AMD chips for. “The moat is not as significant,” Sheth said. “The threshold of pain is coming down over time.” The sheer speed of the AI industry has also opened the door, Boppana argues. “If the world was kind of static and not evolving, and you just had lots of legacy software with the same architectures…then for sure, there is a big moat,” he said. But with AI, the pace of innovation is making the software to program chips easier to use. “On a forward-looking basis, I think it's going to be less and less important.” The OpenAI deal sees AMD now furlongs away from where it was in 2014 when Su took over. Back then, the company seemed to be on its last legs, with layoffs that nixed a quarter of the company and a stock price of around $2. (It’s stock is currently worth more than $235, with a market cap of $382 billion). AMD had missed the boat on mobile devices, and PC sales were lackluster. It was up to Su to preside over a turnaround and win data center business from hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. Now her goal is to make the company a true player in the next technological wave: artificial intelligence. “I think there’s another phase for AMD,” Su told Forbes in a 2023 cover story. “We had to prove that we were a good company. I think we’ve done that. Proving, again, that you’re great, and that you have a lasting legacy of what you’re contributing to the world, those are interesting problems for me.” If all goes well, the 6 gigawatt deployment could beget more such deals in the future. And becoming a go-to vendor for OpenAI might help to kickstart that new phase.
