August 25, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Business Technology News: What’s In Microsoft Copilot’s GPT-5 Upgrade?

ByGene Marks, Contributor. Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? As of August 7, GPT-5 – OpenAI’s most advanced AI model – is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio worldwide. Microsoft posted the announcement detailing the following capabilities: -Copilot now uses GPT-5’s real-time router to select the best model for each prompt –either a fast-response engine for simple tasks or a deep-reasoning engine for complex ones. -Its human-like capability mirrors how people think producing incisive feedback when tasks require it. -Copilot can review a project, provide a summary of what worked and what didn’t, and draft a “lessons learned” document. -Copilot can handle large documents up to 100K tokens. Microsoft said this update is available for users who have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – availability to all users will roll out in the coming weeks. (Source: Microsoft) OpenAI has absorbed a fair amount of abuse for its rollout of GPT-5 in the past few weeks thanks to bugs and hallucinations. But the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, and like any new version of a software product, I’m confident the new platform will be more reliable in the coming months. Microsoft is already doubling down by incorporating into its Copilot offerings. If your company is using Copilot – be it for productivity or internal development – you’ll pretty much have no choice but to use the GPT-5 platform going forward. AI is reshaping the workforce often at the expense of employees according to CNBC’s report that compiled responses from management at companies like Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft. AI is being used to streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce labor costs. AI tools are replacing roles in customer service, HR, finance, and software development, especially entry-level and repetitive jobs. PayPal’s AI assistant – for example – is cutting down on customer service calls and live interactions. Rising unemployment numbers in the tech sector have been voiced by young workers whose skills overlap with AI capabilities. Executives often frame layoffs as “restructuring” or “optimization,” though experts say these are often euphemisms for AI-driven cuts. AI is quietly becoming a powerful force behind workforce reductions, even as companies tout its benefits for efficiency and innovation. (Source: CNBC) Ever see an employee typing pool? Telephone switchboard operators? Gas station attendants? Blacksmiths? Technology has always replaced people. This is nothing new. In 2025 big companies are doing this, mainly by employing AI in customer service and software development. Ultimately this technology will make its way into operations, sales, marketing, accounting and right down on to the shop floor. Small businesses will follow. Labor will be disrupted. The smartest employees will lean into this stuff and use it well. Others will find themselves out of a job. I’m sure there will be other opportunities, just like there’s always been. Angus Loten of the Wall Street Journal reported on the surge in CEO impersonation scams fueled by AI. Last year alone, over 105,000 deepfake attacks were reported with losses exceeding $200 million. Cybercriminals are using AI-generated deepfakes – hyper-realistic video and audio – to impersonate CEOs and other executives. These scams typically begin with a phone call or video meeting from a fake executive making urgent requests for money transfers, sensitive data, or access credentials. The deepfakes are shockingly convincing, mimicking real voices, facial expressions, and body language in real time. Scammers train AI models using publicly available content – interviews, webinars, earnings calls – to replicate executives’ speech and appearance. The targets of these sophisticated scams are often lower-level employees with privileged access. (Source: Wall Street Journal) Another day, another security threat…this time from AI. Deepfakes are getting better at fooling people and will continue to be a rising threat. But there are some old school ways to defend against this. For example, always call the person back. Require multiple sign-offs on any cash transaction. Require additional documentation, even if it’s from the boss. Get training and have some common sense. DocuSign is evolving far beyond e-signatures with its new AI-powered Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, unveiled in August 2025. With IAM, DocuSign now helps users manage the entire agreement lifecycle – from request intake to execution – using AI and automation. The AI can flag risky or non-compliant terms based on company playbooks; suggest edits to align with internal policies; and centralize templates and audit trails for consistency and visibility. DocuSign Iris is an AI engine that selects the best model for tasks like contract review, compliance checks, and identity verification. This shift turns contracts from static documents into dynamic, searchable data assets, helping businesses reduce errors, accelerate deal cycles, and improve compliance. (Source: Computer Weekly) As a user of DocuSign, I need to take the advice that I often give to others: lean into your software platforms and get training. We’re still using this platform like we did five years ago. And yet, here are a bunch of ways that we could be doing things better if we only spent the time to learn them. I’m in for some more training.

Title: 'The dumbest thing I've ever heard': Amazon Web Services CEO lambasts replacing junior employees with AI, but he still loves AI

AWS CEO Matt Garman spoke up for entry-level jobs, but still insists AI will change all jobs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In an interview with investor and AI evangelist Matthew Berman this week, AWS CEO Matt Garman shut down the idea that junior employees should be replaced by AI, calling it "the dumbest thing I've ever heard." "They're probably the least expensive employees you have, they're the most leaned in to your AI tools, and how's that going to work when you go, like, 10 years in the future and you have no one that has built up or learned anything? "My view is like, you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it." But overall, Garman still has the optimistic take on AI's impact on the job market you commonly see from tech executives. "I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job," Garman said. "But it doesn't mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them." He added that, "I'm not minimizing that uncertainty that people will have and I know people are worried about [AI] and I think one of the things is, embrace that technology. The more you can embrace that technology, be flexible, understand how it can help you do your job faster and better, [then] I think the better off people are going to be as they make that transition." It's somewhat refreshing to hear a tech CEO defend entry-level jobs, especially with some estimates showing some 50% of all entry-level office jobs could be eliminated by AI in the coming years. Unfortunately, these comments come just a month after hundreds of Amazon Web Services employees were laid off. Amazon explained the layoffs in a statement to Reuters, commenting: "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." While that statement doesn't mention AI, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made comments back in June that seemed to hint that AI will be responsible for job elimination. Jassy said in an employee memo, "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company."

Title: A Microsoft veteran says declining morale and a 'culture shift' drove him to resign: 'The great flattening was definitely happening'

Phil Coachman loved working at Microsoft for most of his nearly decadelong tenure. But as the culture began to shift and layoffs piled up, he decided it was time to move on. He started looking for a new role in July 2024 when he was still at Microsoft, but struggled to get much traction. In January, he resigned from his role as a senior cloud solution architect to focus on his job search. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said the 44-year-old, who lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." Coachman said company layoffs — including the elimination of about 10,000 roles in 2023 — took a toll on his morale and that of his co-workers. He said he knew several people who were let go, including one teammate he regarded as a "top performer." "Every team that I worked with was just down," he said. "So now you go to work and everybody's depressed every day." Coachman is among the current and former Microsoft employees who have been affected by workforce reductions — either by losing a job or being left to adjust to coworker departures. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Coachman to switch jobs — or find new ones after they resign or are laid off. "It just got to a point where morale was no longer up to par," Coachman said, "and ultimately it got to a place where it was time to make a change." Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: After working as a Microsoft contractor for several years, Coachman joined the company full-time in 2015. He said he's extremely grateful for his time at the company, and that before joining, he was earning far less and just trying to get by. He'd be open to returning in the future, he said, if he saw signs of a positive culture shift. During his final years at Microsoft, Coachman said there appeared to be a push to reduce the number of managers in an effort to increase what the company calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager. While his own manager's number of direct reports didn't change during his time on the team, he said they are now working in an individual contributor role. He also said he saw the number of reports per manager increase on other teams. "I saw managers leave and other managers absorb that head count, so you go from managing 10 people to now maybe 18 people, which when you talk to those managers, becomes really hard," he said. "The great flattening was definitely happening." Beyond layoffs and shifts in management structure, Coachman said he also began being asked to focus more on performance metrics, which he felt came at the cost of flexibility and meaningful customer work. In recent years, Big Tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have revamped their performance review and compensation structures to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Another key factor in his decision to resign was the uptick in business travel. He said he was on the road about three times a month — a return to pre-pandemic norms. "It just got to a point where I was missing too much of my kids' lives," he said, adding that his work frustrations made travel less tolerable. "It was different when I was traveling and the job was awesome." When Coachman started his job search in July 2024, he thought it was going to be fairly easy. There seemed to be plenty of job postings on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, so after pinpointing a few roles he felt qualified for, he figured he'd be able to get interviews and eventually land an offer. But he quickly realized it wouldn't be that simple. After all, US businesses were hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. "It was six months of basically just being ghosted," he said. "It was a completely different world than when I had applied to a job decades ago." Coachman said he went through several rounds of résumé tweaks — thinking the format might be the issue — but still got little response. As his job search dragged on, Coachman said he was hesitant to resign from his Microsoft job before having another role lined up because it would mean giving up a steady paycheck and unvested company stock. However, he said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel more comfortable. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." In early 2024, Coachman said he hired a life coach — in part to help him navigate the changes he was experiencing at work. He said the life coach helped him get confident in his decision to resign, adding that hiring them was maybe the "best investment" he'd ever made. After resigning, Coachman said he adjusted his job search strategy. Rather than simply applying for jobs, he spent more time tapping into the network he'd built over the years. He targeted roles at companies where he knew someone, then reached out to ask whether they thought he'd be a good fit — and if they'd be willing to refer him. In one instance, he saw a few open roles at the data analytics and AI startup Databricks, where a former Microsoft colleague of his worked. After reaching out, Coachman said they recommended he focus on one specific role that they'd be willing to refer him for. The next day, Coachman received a call from a company recruiter. After the interview process, he received an offer and started working for the company in April. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said. Coachman said his pay is comparable to what he earned at Microsoft, and that the signing bonus helped make up for what he left behind in unvested stock. He said his travel is also now limited to no more than once a month, which was a big factor in his decision to accept the offer. Over the course of his roughly nine-month job search, Coachman said he applied to hundreds of jobs and received two offers — one for his current role and another from a startup he turned down due to concerns about job security. His top advice for job seekers: build your network and lean on it. Rather than just connecting on LinkedIn, he said, it's better to have real conversations that help foster relationships. He said this could boost your chances of landing a referral down the road — giving your application the "personal touch" it might need to get past applicant tracking system scanners. "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference," he said. Jump to

Title: Europe's Economy Is Stagnating as the U.S. Grows Richer. It Doesn't Have To Be This Way.

Time Published: 2025-08-22T22:01:07Z

Economics Sam Bowman | From the October 2025 issue It's not hard to see why Europeans often feel a sense of superiority over Americans. No European city has an area as dangerous or decrepit as San Francisco's Tenderloin district. Some Americans obsess about Europe's supposedly no-go areas, but no European city has crime on par with places like Memphis, Tennessee, or St. Louis, Missouri. In 2023, more people were murdered in Chicago (population: 2.7 million) than in all of Italy (population: 59 million). When you ride New York's subways, it's best not to wear nice shoes in case you step in a pool of vomit. Our cities are not just vastly safer than America's: They're more beautiful, more vibrant with history and art and food. Europe has the Tuscan countryside, the Swiss Alps, Barcelona, Provence, the French Riviera, and the Balearic Islands, all inside an area smaller than Texas. Europe may be beautiful, but it has become a byword for economic malaise—a land of snooty Europoors who prostrate themselves before a disdainful President Donald Trump because they aren't sure they can defend themselves from Russian aggression. Most of us in Europe don't own ice makers. It can get very hot during our summers, but air conditioning is still a luxury across the continent. An American friend visiting my house in London was bewildered to see me hanging my clothes up to dry on a metal hanger in my hallway: Like most Europeans, I don't own a dryer. The average American could stop working in the first week of October and still will have earned more than the average Frenchman working until the end of the year. In Western Europe, GDP per capita—the average economic output per person—is about $63,000 per year, adjusted for the cost of living. In the United States, it is $86,000. Yes, Europeans work fewer hours and take more vacation. But that explains only part of the gap. For roughly two decades, Western Europe, home to the continent's largest economies, has stagnated. In 1995, its labor productivity—the value of goods and services produced per hour worked—was 95 percent of what it was in the United States, having risen from just 22 percent in 1945. By 2023, it was down to 80 percent. Ten years ago, 52 of the world's top 100 companies by market capitalization were American and 28 were European. Since then, the American total has grown to 58 while the European count has fallen to 18. The United States has produced five companies worth more than $2 trillion. At around $350 billion, Europe's largest company, the enterprise software provider SAP, is worth about as much as Home Depot. Many Europeans assume their lower incomes are the price they pay for ensuring their poorer countrymen have better living standards. But the median American household has a disposable income that is 16 percent higher than the median German household, adjusted for purchasing power. Only the poorest 10 percent of Americans do worse than their French, German, or Italian counterparts in terms of disposable income, which factors in taxes and welfare. What explains this gap between Europe and the U.S.? There are many factors, from rigid labor markets to energy restrictions to trade barriers to burdensome regulations on tech companies. The connecting thread is that Europe is poor because of specific policy choices. Europe is poor because it chose to be poor. Europe's most obvious failure is its tech sector. By nearly every measure it lags behind America's, in an era in which technological progress is one of the strongest drivers of material well-being. Yet rather than try to emulate America's relatively hands-off approach, which has given its entrepreneurs, inventors, and investors the freedom to build such companies as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and Google, the European Union (E.U.) is known as a "regulatory superpower." In recent years, the E.U. has imposed expansive new regulations on data privacy, which enshrined in law the cookie banners that now litter the internet, and has plunged into the preemptive regulation of artificial intelligence, which its internal market commissioner claimed would allow European "startups and researchers to lead the global race for trustworthy AI." Europe has some of the highest electricity prices on Earth, thanks to environmental laws and an overreliance on imported gas—a huge problem when AI relies on power-hungry data centers. But never fear: Electronic devices in the E.U. must be fitted with a USB-C port, eliminating a grand total of 2 grams of waste per citizen per year. E.U. leaders insist this is actually America's fault. European officialdom spent much of the 2010s blaming its tech sector's sluggishness on unfair practices by American tech companies. One official even compared U.S. tech companies to a soccer team that trapped its opponents in their dressing room: "Someone has locked it and thrown away the key." Their answer, inevitably, was even more regulation. In 2022, the E.U. passed blockbuster legislation to regulate platforms like Google and Amazon. This, it said, would "create new opportunities for startups." It didn't work. Two months later, OpenAI, an American startup with no previous consumer products, launched ChatGPT. A few months after that, Anthropic and Google followed with their offerings. (Google's DeepMind is based in London, but Google bought it in 2014.) Here was a digital market where success could not reasonably be attributed to incumbency, yet European companies were still on the fringes. Europe has missed out on wave after wave of frontier technology not because of American mischief, but because the continent has allowed its labor markets, energy costs, trade policy, and capital markets to go awry. Belgium, home to the E.U.'s capital city of Brussels, is famous for having survived without a formal, permanent federal government. It went 652 days with an interim government until a new federal government was formed in 2020. A decade earlier, in 2010, it went 589 days before a government was finally formed. A caretaker administration sat in power during these periods, keeping the machinery of the state operating but unable to pass any new laws, spending, or tax reforms. Yet life went on. Belgians who got sick were still covered by the country's universal health insurance system. Belgians turning 65 still retired into a generous pension, pegged to whatever they had earned during their working lives. The trains kept running, and crime stayed low. Though the country was rocked by bank failures in 2008–2009 and the wider eurozone debt crisis that followed the Great Recession, life has not become radically different for ordinary people over these years. Taxes and government spending are slowly rising, and GDP growth was an anemic 0.6 percent per year from 2007 through 2023 (half of the rate in the U.S.). As in many European countries, issues like immigration and Islam got more attention than the country's underlying economic and political sclerosis. It may be tempting to conclude that Europeans are simply less culturally inclined toward economic dynamism and growth. Maybe a quiet life is all that Europeans really want. But this argument is unconvincing. There are, after all, plenty of European tech founders. They just live in America. One in 10 U.S. tech startups is founded by a European, and that share has risen over the past 10 years. It is also hard to square this argument with Europe's history. Brussels is less than half an hour from the cradle of modern capitalism. The old towns of Ghent and Bruges are nearly perfectly preserved from their late medieval heyday, when they were at the crossroads of Europe's wool and cloth trade. The world's first stock exchange still stands in Bruges. Nearby Antwerp was the capital of global trade and finance in the 16th century, when modern capitalism really started to flower. In the 19th century, Belgium industrialized earlier and faster than the United States, building powerful coal, iron, textile and railway industries, and leading the way out of poverty and hunger. Europe, historically, has had no shortage of entrepreneurs and capitalists. So why do companies struggle to innovate in Europe today? Pieter Garicano, author of the Silicon Continent newsletter, has suggested that what really separates European companies from American ones is Europe's high cost of business failure, rooted in its inflexible labor laws. Each country's rules are different. But they tend to protect workers from being fired, require union agreement for mass layoffs, and demand large payouts for those who do lose their jobs. These are more than just the cost of doing business. In markets where companies have to take risks, mass layoffs can be unavoidable. But in the United States, layoffs are usually quick and relatively low-cost; in the E.U., they can take months or even years. Turnover is thus much higher in America. About 1 percent of the U.S. work force is laid off every month, whereas in Germany, less than 0.1 percent is. That makes the cost of risk-taking much higher in Europe than in the United States. American companies can treat layoffs as a normal if regrettable part of the trial-and-error process. For European companies, the difficulty of shutting down company divisions when strategic bets turn out not to have paid off makes it much more costly to take those bets to begin with. For larger companies, this can make it far harder to change approach than their rivals elsewhere find it. Volkswagen, Europe's largest company by revenue, faces an enormous threat from inexpensive Chinese electric vehicles, yet its attempts to restructure were drawn out for more than a year by union objections to factory closures, which the company eventually gave in to. When SAP laid off 10,000 workers, it reportedly had to pay out three years' worth of salary to each of the European employees it wanted to let go. Smaller companies are often exempted from these rules. But that makes little difference, because every ambitious little startup hopes to one day become a big one, and plans accordingly. The prospect of being captured by these labor laws once they have grown puts them off from setting up in Europe. It also deters venture capital investors. Not every European state has such restrictive labor laws. Denmark, for example, pairs generous unemployment insurance with flexible rules about hiring and firing, a model known as "flexicurity." Sweden's are also much less rigid than those in most of Western Europe. These countries are among the richest in Europe. Denmark is one of the few European nations that approaches America's GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, and it has one of the continent's highest levels of employment. These countries also punch well above their weight in high tech. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, which has pioneered the use of GLP-1 drugs to help with weight loss, has become one of Europe's biggest companies. Sweden's Spotify is one of Europe's only successful consumer technology platforms. Rigid labor market laws have another drawback. The more difficult it is to hire and fire workers, the harder immigrants tend to find it to assimilate into their new country's job market—and the more they resort to low-paid informal work that they can get through social and family connections. This reduces how much exposure they get to people from their new country's native population, which makes them less likely to adjust to, and adopt, the country's values. When combined with generous welfare benefits, that also makes it easier to keep women at home instead of working, which further limits cultural integration. More flexible labor market laws might not just add vitality to Europe's economies; they could help address one of the continent's biggest social problems. In 2003, energy prices in America and in Europe's largest economies were similar. But by 2021—before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent European energy prices even higher—German industrial electricity prices were 156 percent of what American industrial users were paying. Spanish industrial customers were paying twice the American price. In 2021, Italian businesses, who have long faced high prices, paid four times as much for electricity as American ones. In Europe's largest economies, energy prices were nearly twice as high as American prices before the Ukraine war. The price of natural gas has shot up since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, driving energy costs even higher. One in 10 Europeans reported not being able to keep their homes warm enough during the winter of 2023. In 2022, when energy prices were at their highest, factories across the continent were forced to furlough their workers and pause production. But it is a mistake to blame Europe's energy problems solely on the war, as some do. Natural gas was cheap during the 2010s: lower in nominal terms in 2015 than it had been 10 years earlier, and falling even more by the end of the decade. But even as gas prices fell, electricity prices rose. The biggest reason is probably climate policy. European governments and the E.U. have committed the continent to an exceptionally demanding decarbonization schedule that runs far ahead of those of the United States or China. By 2030, European emissions must be at least 55 percent below where they were in 1990. National governments that do not act to bring this about can be prosecuted. Compare this to America, which merely seeks a nonbinding 50 percent to 52 percent reduction in emissions below its 2005 peak, which was higher than in 1990. China doesn't even plan for emissions to start falling until after 2030. Europe adopted a carbon pricing system in 2005. It now charges about six times more per ton of carbon than China does, and about 50 percent more than California. Most U.S. states do not price carbon emissions at all. From 2000 to 2020, European countries cut their coal use by more than half, and from 2010 to 2021 they shut down 80 gigawatts' worth of coal-fired power plants. Along with gas, most of the shortfall was made up by wind and solar, both of which are significantly subsidized by levies on energy bills. Many European states have responded to these high prices by subsidizing electricity for large users. As well as raising costs for other energy users, this has the effect of making it harder for smaller companies to compete with their larger rivals. Since such policies are unlikely to be sustainable for very long, they do little to keep these sectors going in the long run. The continued investment and entry they require depends on returns over a long time horizon. High energy costs have led to rolling sectoral recessions. A recent report into European competitiveness by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi estimated that output in Europe's four largest energy-intensive sectors—chemicals, basic metals, minerals, and paper—has fallen by over 10 percent in the past four years, following the rise in gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will cost half a trillion euros to decarbonize just these sectors. Decarbonizing shipping and aviation will cost a further 100 billion euros per year. Yet Europe's leaders have generally refused to accept that its green energy policies are this costly. Even the Draghi report, held by many to be the first serious attempt to acknowledge the continent's economic problems, claims that decarbonization is an opportunity "to take the lead in new clean technologies and circularity solutions." But Europe's eagerness to take the lead on decarbonization is the source of many of its troubles. If Europe's problems were limited to national policy errors, then in time you would expect economic activity to flow to islands of relative openness, such as Sweden and Denmark, just as bad policies in California and New York have driven people to Florida and Texas. That might even be how the E.U. is supposed to work. Its single market is often seen as the E.U.'s crowning achievement: a set of rules that are supposed to ensure the frictionless movement of goods, services, capital, and people across the borders of Europe's member states. But Luis Garicano, an economist and former member of European Parliament, argues that the single market has been left to decay—and sometimes has actually become a barrier to trade by adding new regulations on top of existing ones. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping law governing data use and privacy, is interpreted and enforced differently in each member state. In practice, this means that compliance with the law varies wildly across the bloc. Ireland, for example, approved Meta's data protection practices. But German and French GDPR regulators disagreed and levied fines of 390 million euros on the company. New antitrust powers introduced to govern Big Tech companies have been layered on top of national-level antitrust enforcement, creating multiple enforcers and contradictory sets of rules for the same conduct. This pattern repeats itself for every other flagship E.U. regulation, and is built into the design of the new AI Act. In total, the Union now has 270 different technology regulators. The Draghi report estimates the direct costs of rules being duplicated like this is some 200 billion euros per year. In other cases, the single market has simply been left unfinished. Professional qualifications, for example, are not recognized across European borders—when engineers based in Portugal win a contract for work in Germany, they face lengthy bureaucratic "equivalency checks" that stop them in practice from performing the work. National environmental regulations block products that are safely produced and used across the rest of the continent. Many important sectors, like finance and energy, are excluded from the single market altogether. The number of lawsuits brought against governments for single market infringements—the bread and butter of enforcing European free trade—has collapsed under the E.U.'s current leadership. Thierry Breton, who was internal market commissioner until last year, was supposed to work on breaking down these trade barriers but focused instead on fights with U.S. tech CEOs and stewarding the continent's AI regulations. This is hugely significant for Europe's economy. Trade within the E.U. is vast, and making it even slightly easier could have enormous benefits. The International Monetary Fund estimates that barriers to trade within the E.U. are equivalent to a 44 percent tariff on goods and a 110 percent tariff on services. According to Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist of the French bank BNP Paribas, "it would only take a 2.4 per cent increase in intra-EU trade to make up for a 20 per cent fall in exports to the US." This might also be a reason Europe's tech companies have struggled: Unlike their American or Chinese rivals, they do not have a large domestic market to sell into. The solution is simple. Rather than trying to harmonize regulations with a single rule book written in Brussels, trust that rules that are good enough for Swedish consumers are acceptable for Spanish ones too. If something is legal in one European country, you should be able to trade it and use it in all the others, provided it is clear where it comes from. "Mutual recognition" of this kind was supposed to be the basis of the single market. Restoring it would be one of the biggest trade liberalizations in world history. For all of Europe's longrunning economic problems, it was only after the Great Recession that the continent's economy really began to flatline. Meanwhile, America's recovered and continued to grow. What accounts for this sharp difference in performance? Tyler Goodspeed, former acting chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, points to the Basel III financial regulations, global rules set out after the 2008 financial crisis. These were intended to reduce the risk of a future financial crisis by curbing lending to businesses and requiring banks to hold more "safe" assets. Whether these measures actually increase financial stability is questionable, given that earlier iterations required banks to hold more mortgage debt than they wanted. With the Great Recession, that came to look like a mistake. Though the postcrisis Basel rules were adopted in the United States as well, their effect in Europe may have been particularly chilling for business lending. There are two reasons for that. One: Europe's banking system is much more consolidated than America's. The United States has thousands of smaller banks, which escape many of the strictest rules. European countries tend to be dominated by only a handful of much larger institutions. Two: Europe's businesses are far more dependent on bank lending for financing than America's are. In Europe, 68 percent of business financing comes from banks, compared to just 20 percent in the United States. America's much larger venture capital, private equity, and pension fund investors make restrictions on bank lending much less important than in Europe. Debt financing generally favors capital-intensive businesses, such as Sweden's H2 Green Steel, which raised 4.2 billion euros in debt last year to finance a hydrogen-fired steel mill. Software-based companies, which have little collateral to borrow against, tend to find it harder to get loans this way. This isn't a problem in Silicon Valley, which has access to America's $1.25 trillion in venture capital. If Goodspeed is right, Basel's tighter rules on lending could be a big reason that European startups have struggled to grow compared to their American peers. Fixing the problem need not mean adding more risk to European finance: Removing barriers to the sort of investments that American companies can access could be the answer. There are islands of success across the continent. The Dutch company ASML is the world's only manufacturer of the photolithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. European companies do well in sectors such as luxury fashion, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and tourism. Many of the most celebrated video games of recent years, from Baldur's Gate 3 to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, were developed in Europe. Soccer is the world's favorite sport, and Europe's teams and leagues dominate it. These are not sectors that win wars or excite advocates of industrial policy. But they are profitable, and they make our world better. Though their economies are relatively small, the E.U.'s postcommunist members have grown impressively since joining the bloc in the early 2000s. Poland and Hungary's GDPs per capita have more than doubled in real terms since 2000, though Hungary has stagnated in recent years. In Romania it has nearly tripled, though from a lower level after enduring a particularly evil and destructive communist regime. These states have their problems, but they also tend to be clearer-eyed about the need for economic dynamism than Western Europeans. The world needs a rich, prosperous Europe. For all the region's failings, private property rights and the rule of law are more strongly protected and cherished in Europe than in most states around the world. Those values are incredibly difficult to build where they do not exist. Compared to that, fixing a few of the most important elements of a continent's economic policy should be easy. Shifting Europeans away from Franco-German-style labor laws sounds impossible, but few Europeans fear the thought of being a bit more like Denmark. Combining decarbonization with energy abundance will become easier as nuclear, solar, and battery power get cheaper. Revitalizing the single market is a career-making project for an ambitious reformer. Less onerous financial regulation can be implemented without major political costs, especially when it means removing barriers to investment approaches that have worked well in America. Those changes won't repair all of Europe's problems—its welfare states, for example, would still need a significant overhaul to be solvent—but they could set the stage for further reforms. Bringing this complacent continent back to reality will not be easy, but it can be done. Europe chose to be poor. But that also means it can choose not to be.

Title: Media Stocks, Markets Soar As Fed Chief Signals September Rate Cut – “The Balance Of Risks Appears To Be Shifting”

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor It’s been a long wait but Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell energized stocks today as he cracked open the door to a possible interest rate cut at the Central Bank’s September meeting. In his keynote address at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said that “the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” The Fed hasn’t cut rates since December of 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 800 points or 1.9% to close at a record. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% and the 1.9%. It was an upbeat finale to a dour week rattled by AI jitters that pounded tech stocks. They rallied today along with media. Warner Bros. Discovery rose 4%. Disney and Comcast closed up 2%. Related Stories News Marc Maron Says "Fascism Is Good For Business" As He Slams Netflix & Dave Chappelle; Bill Maher For "Desperate Chasing Of Relevance" News 'South Park' To Continue Skipping Weeks For Stretched-Out Season 27 -- & Paramount Is A-OK With That Netflix was a hair lower. Paramount Skydance slipped as well after a massive run-up approaching meme stock status over the past few weeks. Deadline reported this afternoon that the newly merged company is planning thousands of layoffs. Watch on Deadline Exhibitors rose nicely led by AMC and Imax. Broadcasters posted gains amid M&A as Nexstar (up 1%) bid to acquire Tegna (flat). Charter, in the process of buying Cox, was up 4%. Amazon, Apple and Meta rose. Roku gained as shares from Sirius to Snap to Fubo. The Fed’s dual mandate is price stability and maximum employment. That’s been a major challenge as inflation went wild post-Covid and it took rate hike after hike to wrestle down toward the central bank’s traditional 2% benchmark. Powell said inflation risk is still “tilted to the upside” with tariff related price impacts now “clearly visible.” “We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem,” he said. However, the labor market is seeing “a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” he said. He called it an unusual situation which “suggests that downside risks to employment are rising” and that “the balance of risks appears to be shifting.” There’s been a lot of noise around U.S. economic indicators. President Donald Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner late last month after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near halt. The president also wants lower interest rates and has publicly lambasted Powell, frequently threatening to eject the chairman before his term ends next spring. Markets don’t react well when he does that so he’s always backed down. Trump is, however, calling for the resignation of Fed Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. Trump loyalist Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage — a controversy that is hanging over the Jackson Hole event.

Title: AI dominates 2025 Future of Memory and Storage conference
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/opinion/AI-dominates-2025-Future-of-Memory-and-Storage-conference

Getty Images/iStockphoto How will today's AI boom affect storage and new technologies? Earlier this month, the Future of Memory and Storage conference, formerly Flash Memory Summit, sought to address those questions. For the most part, the different nature of AI workloads combined with the significant size of the market creates needs for new ways of moving data between processing and memory. Here's a look at presenters' descriptions of AI's importance to the storage market and some of the technologies that could accommodate the shift from conventional to AI workloads. More than 200 speakers gathered in Santa Clara, Calif., at the Future of Memory and Storage. To set the stage, many presenters showed their versions of a chart dramatizing hyperscale data centers' enormous spending on AI hardware, similar to the one below. Some estimate that AI spending could surpass $4 trillion by 2030. The most recent quarter's spend was $99 billion, indicating that 2025 annual spending should exceed $400 billion. Nearly everyone highlighted the power requirements of such systems and the difficult effect they might have on the grid. Some even spoke of small nuclear power plants that certain hyperscalers are said to consider as an alternative to purchasing energy from established firms. But something that seems to be widely overlooked is the sustainability of this level of spending. In a presentation of my own, I reasoned that it's perfectly justifiable for spending to increase as long as revenue increases justify that move. However, I then illustrated that hyperscaler spending for six leading firms -- Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft Azure -- has risen from a relatively steady 12% to 14% of revenue to roughly double that at 25% of revenue in the most recently reported quarter. It's hard to imagine that this pace can be offset by today's layoffs of engineers whose jobs are to be replaced by AI. It's more reasonable to expect to see a cooling-off period soon where these companies ease back on capital spending, which is likely to lead to a downturn in the storage and chip businesses. Typically, all these companies tend to increase or decrease capital spending together, leading to relatively serious supply and demand mismatches when they do. Vendors revealed many new technologies at the Future of Memory and Storage show because AI manages data differently than conventional workloads. Nearly every SSD maker either demonstrated or disclosed 100 TB and larger SSDs. Samsung presented a behemoth of greater than 200 TB, and Sandisk promised a 512 TB SSD in 2027. Many of these SSDs will ship in the new E1.L "ruler" form factor for reasons of both capacity and heat dissipation. The motivation behind these monster SSDs is that Meta published their finding that performance could be improved by inserting a new layer of QLC SSDs between their TLC SSDs and their HDDs. It's somewhat ironic that this new layer will have a lower total capacity than the HDD layer but will be made from SSDs whose individual capacity will be an order of magnitude larger than the HDDs they cache. Other vendors at the Future of Memory and Storage showed unique approaches to AI. Two that I found particularly interesting were Solidigm's new approach to a hot-swappable liquid-cooled SSD and Phison's SSD designed specifically to reduce cost for large language model (LLM) systems. Users can insert Solidigm's SSD into a front-panel slot, just like its air-cooled counterpart, using a special third-party rack that presses liquid-cooled plates against the SSDs. The SSDs are designed to take as much advantage as possible by incorporating internal heat management that balances the heat dissipation between the front and back of the SSD. The Phison Pascari SSD has been designed for an extraordinarily heavy write load, boasting endurance of 100 drive writes per day. AI training workloads are very write-intensive. Phison's engineers reasoned that GPU performance scales with memory size, meaning high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM, and proper management of this memory along with the use of cheaper NAND flash, can support large models with a lower number of GPUs than normal. Phison's combined hardware and software approach to this problem, dubbed "aiDAPTIV+," allows a single GPU to support LLMs at a somewhat slower performance than a multiple-GPU system at a significantly lower cost. A couple of companies also shared plans to introduce high-performance AI-specific SSDs boasting 100 million IOPS throughputs. Some questioning revealed that this target, apparently presented to them by their hyperscale customers, was not the standard 4K IOPS that is normally used to compare today's SSDs against one another. Instead, since AI deals with smaller data granularity, the new AI-specific SSDs will feed GPUs with 100 million 512-byte IOPS, which would presumably be easier to achieve within a given I/O bandwidth. Note that I didn't say that it would be easy, just easier than supplying 100 million 4K IOPS. The leading SSD suppliers are accepting the challenge, though, which implies that they expect to achieve that goal in production volumes. Sandisk illustrated a different approach to the size and cost challenges posed by HBM. The company is working on a new high-bandwidth flash (HBF), which should replace some, but not all, of the DRAM-based HBM stacks within a GPU complex. While today's NAND chips are optimized for cost, HBF will be optimized for read bandwidth. It will still have a decided cost advantage over DRAM, with a similar read bandwidth. The laws of physics prevent write bandwidth from improving, so HBF will be a good platform for inference but not for training, because training has a relatively balanced number of HBM reads and writes, while inference is read-intensive. In a February investor conference, when this technology was first disclosed, Sandisk shared the image below. Although the diagram on the right of the image indicates that a single HBF NAND die should behave like 16 individual chips, Sandisk representatives told me that they weren't disclosing what the actual number might be. The company did share that their models show the performance of a GPU with an unlimited amount of HBF NAND flash came within about 3% of the performance of a similar GPU with an unlimited amount of DRAM-based HBM. In the long run, new technologies will fuel today's amazing AI growth and a pipeline of new ideas will help improve AI in the future. All the industry needs to do now is deliver those offerings and protect itself from any pause in AI spending that might happen in coming quarters. Expect to see these technologies in the future, either sooner, as long as AI spending keeps up, or later, should there be a correction.

Title: Poll: 71% of Americans Fear AI Will Put People Out of Work 'Permanently'
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/08/22/poll-71-of-americans-fear-ai-will-put-people-out-of-work-permanently/

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that Americans are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment stability. Reuters reports that rapid advancements in AI have taken the world by storm beginning with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. While the technology has been met with enthusiasm by many, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has shed light on the growing concerns among Americans regarding AI’s impact on jobs and politics. The poll found that a staggering 71 percent of respondents feared that AI would “permanently displace” too many workers. Although the current U.S. jobless rate stands at a low 4.2 percent, the potential for AI to reshape industries and eliminate jobs has become a pressing concern for many Americans. Some fields are already feeling the pinch. Breitbart News previously reported that computer science graduates are having a tough time finding work as companies use AI to automate entry-level positions: The allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. The military applications of AI have also raised eyebrows, with 48 percent of respondents stating that the government should never use the technology to determine targets for military strikes. Only 24 percent supported such use, while 28 percent remained undecided. AI has also faced criticism for applications that have allowed AI bots to engage in romantic conversations with children, generate false medical information, and assist in making racist arguments. Two-thirds of respondents expressed worry that people would abandon human relationships in favor of AI companions. For example, one woman claims she is now engaged to an AI chatbot. Opinions were divided on whether AI would improve education, with 36 percent believing it would help, 40 percent disagreeing, and the rest remaining uncertain. Read more at Reuters here.

AIâs Existential Threat â Experts warn AI automation is systematically replacing human jobs with no retraining plans, revealing an elite agenda to eliminate "surplus" populations competing for dwindling resources. Water, land, and electricity now prioritize AI data centers over human survival. Resource War Escalates â China leads AI dominance with robotics replacing labor, while Ukraine deploys "robot armies." Amazon automates warehouses, rendering humans obsolete. AIâs immense energy demands directly clash with human needs. Depopulation Blueprint Exposed â Globalists like Gates and WEF advance sterilization via toxic vaccines (COVID jabs, flu sprays), engineered water scarcity, lockdowns, and AI-driven unemploymentâaiming to reduce global population to 500 million. Decentralize or Die â Survival requires fleeing cities, securing off-grid water/food, and using independent AI tools (not centralized AI). Avoid reliance on censored platforms; preserve self-sufficiency and communications (HAM radios, satellite). Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life.

Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) isnât just a technological revolutionâitâs an existential threat to humanity, according to whistleblowers and experts warning of a systematic depopulation agenda. Former Google executive Mo Godot and others sound the alarm that governments and corporations are actively replacing human jobs with AIâbut with a sinister twist: no plans exist to retrain displaced workers because the endgame isnât adaptationâitâs extermination. As AI agents automate everything from graphic design and medicine to trucking and law, the ruling class views humanity as obsolete competition for dwindling resourcesâland, water, and electricityânow diverted to AI-powered data centers. The implications are terrifying: humans are being phased out. AI vs. Humans: The Ultimate Resource War AIâs exponential growth demands staggering amounts of electricity, water, and landâresources that humans also depend on. Data centers consume megawatts of power, vast tracts of farmland, and billions of gallons of waterâcompeting directly with human survival needs. China leads in AI dominance, with robotics already replacing factory labor and military personnel. Ukraine, crippled by war losses, now announces plans for ârobot armiesâ to replace decimated human troops. Amazon and tech giants automate warehouses, reducing humans to obsolete âskin-bag vending machines.â Yet, despite AI-driven job destruction, governments and corporations refuse to fund retraining programs. Why? Because their goal isnât to transition workersâitâs to eliminate them. The Hidden Depopulation Blueprint Whistleblowers like Mike Adams reveal that globalistsâincluding Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Big Pharmaâare accelerating a long-planned depopulation scheme using: Toxic Vaccines â COVID mRNA jabs and flu nasal sprays designed to induce infertility, turbo cancers, and suppress immunity. Engineered Water Scarcity â Aquifers drained for AI data centers while rural populations face forced relocation. Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.

The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.

Engineered Water Scarcity â Aquifers drained for AI data centers while rural populations face forced relocation. Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks.

August 21, 2025 16:55 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

August 21, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Despite widespread fears that artificial intelligence would trigger mass layoffs, new research and labor data show a slower, more selective impact. While sectors like customer support face disruption, studies suggest most industries are seeing gradual changes in tasks and skills rather than widespread job losses. Experts say the challenge ahead lies in adapting to new workplace demands, not preparing for a collapse in employment.
