Title: CEOs Using AI to Terrorize Their Employees
URL: https://futurism.com/ceo-ai-scare-labor
Time Published: 2025-06-20T17:09:36Z
Full Content:
As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else. Of course, AI, like many new technologies, will also create new jobs, but it’s not yet clear how many. Amazon partner Anthropic predicts even more sweeping layoffs coming. Agentic AI is the disruption du jour at this year’s TM Forum DTW Ignite conference Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab valued at $10B after $2B fundraising (per Financial Times) Google updates Gemini 2.5 LLM series with new entry-level model, pricing changes Midjourney debuts new V1 video generation model Domino Data Lab introduces new AI governance, data management features Nurix AI launches enterprise-grade human-like voice AI agents with NuPlay Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation OpenAI bags $200M Pentagon contract to explore defense industry AI applications Healthcare technology startup Commure raises $200M ahead of IPO AI startup Tennr raises $101M to revolutionize patient referrals Clay reportedly raises new funding led by CapitalG on a $3B valuation Maven AGI, which aims to unify the full “customer journey,” raised $50M in Series B funding Traversal launches with $48M to tackle site reliability and observability with AI Wildfire detection startup Pano AI raises $44M (per WSJ) Browserbase reels in $40M for its browser automation tools Sedai raises $20M to optimize cloud environments with AI agents Tadaweb raises $20M to scale open-source intelligence platform enhanced with AI Extend gets $17M in funding to boost the speed and accuracy of document processing with AI models Diskover gets $7.5M from Snowflake, NetApp and others to facilitate unstructured data discovery for AI Startup Typedef gets $5.5M seed funding to build customized data pipelines for AI model workloads There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Broadcom says VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 recognizes the ascendancy of private cloud And our analysis: VCF 9 goes live: Recapping the execution roadmap for Broadcom’s AI and cloud infrastructure vision Pure Storage launches unified data management cloud and new flash arrays AWS to introduce updated server CPU, new AI training chip Vibe coding, platform power and the new face of AppDev – theCUBE Research analysis Mixpanel expands analytics platform with metric trees, AI insights and experimentation tools Trend Micro debuts data center appliances with built-in cybersecurity software Key takeaways from Cisco Live 2025 Texas Instruments to invest $60B+ in US fab network Amazon to invest nearly $13B in data centers in Australia Coralogix gets $115M in funding to pioneer agentic AI-powered observability Defense technology startup Mach Industries raises $100M PostHog raises $70M to simplify software development projects Clinical AI startup Nabla to focus on agentic automation after raising $70M in funding With $27M in funding, Fleet wants to bring more freedom to enterprise device management Onebrief, a platform for operational planning and military staff workflows, reaches $1.1B valuation with $20M Series C extension, nearly doubling in 3 months Tensec to deliver real-time, cross-border payments to smaller businesses after raising $10M in funding We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Security researchers find 16B stolen credentials from malware in open cloud storage UBS confirms employee data leak after ransomware attack on supplier INKY warns of new QR code phishing tactic using embedded JavaScript AWS focuses on simplifying cloud security at re:Inforce 2025 conference CrowdStrike launches Falcon for AWS Security Incident Response at re:Inforce 2025 Operant AI expands Gatekeeper platform with MCP Gateway for AI runtime security New Commvault and Kyndryl partnership focuses on hybrid cloud recovery and regulatory compliance Apiiro report reveals industry differences are shaping generative AI risk profiles Kusari debuts AI-powered pull request security tool for software supply chain protection Cyolo updates privileged access platform with tools to monitor unmanaged vendor connections Dashlane adds AI phishing alerts to Omnix platform to bolster credential protection Base44 joins Wix in $80M deal to support natural language software development Bitdefender to acquire Mesh Security to bolster email protection for managed service providers Neovera acquires Greenway Solutions to expand fraud testing capabilities More cybersecurity news here Waymo’s robotaxis will soon hit the streets of New York City Trump will push TikTok deadline another 90 days SpaceX competitor Eutelsat raising €1.35B in new funding And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Amar Subramanya, head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, is leaving the company, employees were told in a reorganization announced last week.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-tips-how-to-start-investing-property-homeowner-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-20T13:16:34Z

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Jump to

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Time Published: 2025-06-20T09:00:02Z

Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

Title: Do The Woo Community: The Value of Starting Over in the Tech Industry

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.

By Bob Unruh June 19, 2025 Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon, recently warned that technology, specifically artificial intelligence, will cost thousands of Americans their jobs in coming months and years. Intel, the faltering legacy tech company, confirmed that. It announced, in an email sent to employees, that it could lay off as many as one-fifth of its staff. “These are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company,” explained Naga Chandrasekaran, an executive at the Oregon-based company. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! His comments were confirmed in a report at Oregon Live. Chandrasekaran said the company is expecting cut up to 20% of its factory workers. Intel has reportedly told employees it plans to lay off 15 percent to 20 percent of workers from its chip manufacturing division, with job cuts expected in other divisions. https://t.co/xSp1oPaQFQ — Semiconductor News by Dylan Martin (@DylanOnChips) June 17, 2025 A report at the Daily Mail noted the company has about 109,000 workers globally, so the cuts could mean up to 21,800 being laid off. “It is not clear how many work in US-based factories, and how many American jobs will go,” the report said. Microsoft had confirmed only days ago it was preparing to cut thousands of jobs, and Amazon also said it was making plans for “brutal” workforce cuts, all because of AI. The Mail noted this was the second round of layoffs at Intel in just a year, after last winter’s 15% cutback. The report said the company troubles are because of upstart competitors, compounding financial losses, and a declining stock price. Chipmakers IBM, AMD, TSMC and NVIDIA have gained ground by investing in AI, the report said. Intel’s stock price was $68 in 2021, but only about $21 now. It reported a loss of $821 million during the first quarter of the year, the report said. It was Jassy who said, “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: Microsoft to lay off thousands in July, but don't worry, AI's getting $80 billion

In context: There's been plenty of talk about machines displacing human workers in the AI Age, mainly focusing on direct replacements – computers taking over tasks like design and programming. Meanwhile, spending on AI infrastructure soars as investment in human skills steadily declines. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft is preparing to lay off thousands of workers next month, with most of the cuts expected to hit the company's sales and customer service divisions. It's a jarring move but not an unfamiliar one in tech. What stands out this time is what Microsoft is doing with the money it's saving: pumping an estimated $80 billion into AI infrastructure over the next fiscal year. That number isn't a typo. As Microsoft reshapes its workforce, it's reshaping its balance sheet, too. It's laying off human employees while building new homes for silicon-based replacements – in hyperscale data centers, GPUs, and power-hungry server farms. Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to AI, but the connection is increasingly difficult to ignore. The company is investing heavily in machine learning capabilities across its entire product line, from Azure to Office. Its partnership with OpenAI and the widespread deployment of Copilot reflect a strategic pivot away from labor-intensive workflows and toward automated solutions. Despite the scale of this shift, Microsoft has offered little public indication that large-scale retraining or internal upskilling efforts are part of its AI strategy. The company clearly has the resources to help employees adapt to an AI-centric future, yet such initiatives are largely absent from its announcements and disclosures. The emphasis so far has been on infrastructure, partnerships, and AI product rollouts – not on preparing its broader workforce for the changes those investments will bring. This approach reflects a broader trend across the tech sector. Companies including Amazon, Duolingo, and Dropbox have all cited AI-driven efficiency gains when announcing workforce reductions. These moves often emphasize shareholder value and operational agility, even as they diminish opportunities for employees to transition into new roles within the organization. Microsoft plans to lay off thousands globally in the coming weeks. While the company has not disclosed exact figures, reports suggest a significant impact on customer-facing teams. These cuts underscore the shift away from labor-intensive roles as Microsoft pivots toward automation and AI-driven services. The contrast is stark: AI receives billions in dedicated capital, while workers get severance packages and uncertain futures. Microsoft isn't just betting on artificial intelligence – it's actively reorganizing its operations around it. This strategy may pay off in the long term, but it highlights a widening gap between investment in automation and support for displaced employees.

Title: Amazon To Cut 1,000 Jobs Due To AI. Now What?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2025/06/19/amazon-to-cut-1000-jobs-due-to-ai-now-what/

ByEli Amdur ByEli Amdur, Contributor. Giant robot flicking tiny man. Ai technologies and unemployment problem concept. Vector ... More illustration. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it would cut 1,000 jobs due to AI. Is anyone surprised? The monster created by Big Tech has begun rising up to consume its creator. Well, perhaps not totally consume, but the damage done could likely be (a) measurable, (b) a harbinger of things to come at Amazon, and (c) a phenomenon we will see far and wide, not just at Amazon. It’s inescapable for a few reasons. First, according to data from layoffs.fyi, which monitors tech worker layoffs, already this year 141 companies have laid off 62,832 employees. In 2024, it was 152,922 employees from 551 companies and in 2023, it was 264,220 employees from 1,193 companies. Layoffs, we see, are inevitable – especially in tech. At the onset of new technologies or the introduction of new products, hiring takes place with kid-in-a-candy-store concern for consequences. A year later, things look quite different – and that kid is now an obese diabetic. Now, however, we see a direct cause and effect, unmistakenly traceable to AI, because AI has advanced so quickly that it is now capable of doing many of those lower, entry-level jobs we’ve long feared it could do. I am reminded of the classic line from the 1960s comic strip Pogo: “We have met the enemy and it is us.” Make no mistake, though, this is not limited to tech jobs. In May, I posted a column here, “How AI Affects The Socioeconomic Order Of The Workplace” (5/27) and here’s what we saw: Beginner programmers and coders, data analysts, junior paralegals, retail sales associates, content writers, copy editors, graphic artists, and grant writers are among the many who will deal with this reality. There’s more, but space and time have limits here. This phenomenon of jobs being eaten by AI will undoubtedly be seen at all tech companies, as they are the creators of this to begin with. But it will spread elsewhere. Picture lava streaming down an erupting volcano. But there’s a big upside to this. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 78 million jobs, even after job losses are factored in. So, working the math and going with aggregated and widely-accepted estimations that for every job killed by AI three or four will be created, we come to this: 78 million is the WEF’s net number, bringing us to 100 million or more, gross. Thise jobs will just not be the vulnerable entry-level jobs we’ve been discussing here. It’s complicated, no? If I were running a large company, I’d ask for a meeting. In the same room, I’d have the president of the local university or community college, my senator or congressperson, and me. I’d have one item on the agenda: those AI skills we’ve been teaching for our graduates to find their first jobs need to be relegated to high school and forever be seen as obsolete. AI will forever do them. Next, define the next level of AI jobs and teach them as the new entry level, while teaching other skills – communication, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. – that our new employees would have been developing on he way up. We are past throwing our hands in the air. This is no longer something new or mysterious. “Success delayed is success denied,” said Ben Franklin. We just simply must take the first step.

Title: The Big Picture: Streaming and Social Media Climb Amid Traditional Media’s Slow-Motion Breakdown

The headlines all point toward the decline of linear and traditional models, with the nagging question of whether new means of distribution can pick up the slack Traditional media is experiencing what often feels like a slow-motion nervous breakdown, which would hardly come as news to anyone operating in the thick of that. Yet occasionally a week comes along with ostensibly distinct stories that help crystallize the larger picture, almost like the cop finally piecing things together at the end of “The Usual Suspects.” In just the last few days, a handful of reports speak to trends that coalesce into a single clarifying moment: Old media is limping along on wobbly legs, if not its death bed yet, and efforts to save it are merely prolonging the inevitable. A shift in consumption patterns for entertainment, news and information has hamstrung many long-established means of disseminating content, while pushing newer forms to the forefront. Clocking each of these developments as they fly by — sometimes while on the move ourselves, increasingly via our phones — the connections aren’t always obvious. So let’s pause for a breath and take inventory of this week’s media news, and the changing of the guard that it reveals. Part of that shift has been driven by YouTube, and as if on cue: Shorter version: Teens and young adults (especially) are spending less time watching movies and TV shows, while allocating more to snippets of video and getting their news from TikTok, not those stodgy cable networks watched by their parents and grandparents. But wait, there’s more. Netflix unveiled a groundbreaking deal Wednesday to carry the output from French broadcaster TF1, an agreement TF1 Group CEO Rodolphe Belmer described in its announcement as becoming necessary “as viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases” — a trend that has crossed international borders. Finally, Amazon issued a memo that served as a not-so-subtle warning to its employees about the impact of artificial intelligence, noting there will be layoffs associated with AI picking up tasks performed by actual humans, while offering the only modestly reassuring aside that some new jobs will be created as a byproduct of that shift. So basically, “Get on board, or get out of the way.” Although frankly, a host of recent headlines have made clear AI’s impact remains unpredictable enough that it won’t necessarily spare early adopters either, in the same way monsters in old movies frequently kill the mad scientist that unleashes them first. The main problem, grappled with since the transition from print to online and more recently the great migration to streaming that began with the launch of multiple services (including Disney+ and Apple TV+) in 2019, is the uncertainty about when these lines will intersect — whether newer revenue streams can supplant old ones, such as linear TV, before those models slide off a cliff. The newspaper industry dealt with that game of digital chicken first, as the web gobbled up its classified advertising business and distribution of print editions, falling victim to those forces despite the alarm bells sounded about trading in “print dollars for digital dimes.” Although most legacy publications have managed to survive, with a few notable exceptions like the New York Times, it’s generally in dramatically scaled-down form, both in terms of the size of their staffs and the scope of their ambitions. Step back a little further, and it’s easy to weave more pixels into the picture, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal’s spinoffs of their declining cable assets, and whether the economies of scale associated with mergers and acquisitions can be enough to justify anteing up for an entity whose trend lines point in the wrong direction. In “The Usual Suspects,” the messy cop defends his scattered work area by telling a colleague, “It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.” In the daily scramble of these jobs, including the race to cover these stories, it can be difficult to take the time to seek perspective or try connecting the dots, making things appear messier, even chaotic. Whether the view is from up close or gains clarity from far away, though, the prospects for traditional media don’t paint a comforting picture.

Title: Microsoft Plans Layoffs Targeting Sales Teams

Microsoft is gearing up for another round of layoffs, with plans to cut thousands of jobs with a specific focus on its sales workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reports that technology giant Microsoft is preparing to trim its workforce once again, with the latest round of job cuts expected to be announced in early July, following the close of the company’s fiscal year. Sources close to the situation revealed that the layoffs will predominantly impact sales positions, although other teams may also be affected. The exact timing of the announcement could still change. This news comes on the heels of a previous wave of layoffs in May, which involved 6,000 employees losing their jobs, primarily in product and engineering roles. The customer-facing positions, such as sales and marketing, were largely spared during that round of cuts. In April, Microsoft informed employees of its intention to rely more heavily on third-party firms for the sale of software to small and medium-sized businesses, potentially foreshadowing the upcoming reductions in the sales force. As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, spending tens of billions of dollars on servers and data centers, executives have pledged to Wall Street and cautioned employees that the company will maintain a tight grip on spending in other areas. The company has stated that it regularly assesses its organizational structure to ensure it is allocating resources effectively for growth. At the end of June 2024, Microsoft had a total of 228,000 employees, with 45,000 of them working in sales and marketing positions. The company has a history of restructuring teams and announcing other organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. Breitbart News previously reported on a significant layoff in January that impacted the company’s security division: One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort.

Title: I'm a former Amazon developer. Jassy's memo doesn't surprise me, and I don't think engineers should worry about their jobs.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jassy-memo-former-amazon-employee-not-worried-ai-jobs-2025-6

Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 30-year-old Shahad Ishraq, from Germany. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Reading Andy Jassy's new memo on generative AI, I'm not surprised by anything. I worked at Amazon for nearly 3 ½ years and left in late May because of the five-day return-to-office mandate. My commute took an hour and a half each way, so I wanted to move to another job where I could still see my career progressing and do interesting work. The memo feels consistent with what I'd been hearing from management and Jassy while working at Amazon. I think Jassy's comments are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. I initially worried about AI when I wasn't as familiar with the products. However, using AI will give you a better understanding of what it's capable of and what skills you can develop to differentiate yourself. I joined Amazon in 2022 as a systems development engineer, working in Leipzig, Germany. My day-to-day work involved designing and implementing software and performing operational tasks. When AI tools first came out a few years ago, we were told we could use them, but we should be very careful and follow the company's policies on their usage. Amazon is a huge company. Within it, I spotted and heard about different approaches to AI adoption. There seemed to be a bunch of excited early adopters who shared their findings with everyone. There were people like me who followed the first bunch and saw what went well. There were also some skeptics and a small number of engineers who were outright against using AI. For me, the dawn of AI was a bit scary at first. Everyone was saying it would put me out of a job. Unless you test the technology yourself and see what it can do, you'll fear the unknown. AI wasn't part of my job until sometime in 2024. There were also some barriers to using the technology. When I first joined Amazon, ChatGPT wasn't even available, but when it did come out in 2022, we couldn't use it that extensively because of data security issues that come with copying our code into those models. When Anthropic's Claude became available within Amazon Bedrock — the company's internal service for developing generative AI applications — we were able to make more use of AI. In my last few months at Amazon, I started experimenting a lot with approved AI tools, doing extensive tests with them. They don't do everything for me, but I've integrated these tools into my workflow, such as by asking it to create a plan for my tasks or spot differences between documents. I noticed it often fails, and I have to make changes, but overall, it has improved my speed and increased my throughput significantly. Andy Jassy's memo feels very consistent with what I've been told internally before I left Amazon and what the company has communicated publicly. News articles talking about the memo focus on Jassy saying that a lot of jobs will be taken by AI. However, in the same sentence, he also says jobs will be created. I've tried creating production-level applications using AI, and it takes a lot of effort to get these products ready. A company like Amazon can't roll out an application that breaks and causes havoc. They have to have firewalls, checks, and tests. I don't see people going out of jobs in huge numbers soon. Amazon went on a hiring spree during COVID. If we see more layoffs, I think it will be associated with cutting back after that spree, rather than the impacts of AI. AI agents are helping out software engineers a lot, and the amount of work agents do will probably increase gradually. I'm able to get agents working on three different things, while I look into other tasks. But AI hallucinates quite a lot. It does things it's not asked to do. I often have to correct an AI agent producing code. Humans will be required to build guardrails and act as guardrails themselves. Implementing these guardrails will take time, and I think this will slow down the AI agent hype. I think Jassy's comments about AI are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. Memos have to come out. Jassy has to place a lot of optimism around AI; otherwise, shareholders will think they're not doing anything with AI. My advice to Amazon employees is to start using AI as much as possible to overcome their fear of the unknown. I now work as a software engineer at a utilities company. The more I've been using AI, the more comfortable I feel about myself. I can see what skills I have that I can use to stay relevant. In tech, languages and developments come really fast. My guess is that people will need to use AI to write code and increase their throughput, and pure software engineers will gradually be replaced by people who have both software engineering and AI skills. I'm personally trying to learn these skills because I think they'll become more important. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider: "Amazon employees use internal generative AI tools every day to innovate on behalf of our customers. We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including restrictions on sharing confidential information with third-party generative AI services."

Title: Amazon is apparently forcing some workers to relocate to its main office hubs

Amazon updates its office-working policy once again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is requiring some corporate workers to relocate closer to their managers and teams, targeting cities like Seattle, Arlington and Washington DC (via Bloomberg). The report notes thousands of employees could be forced to move from across various teams, however the company's famously vocal workers are understandably frustrated with the decision. Amazon has been reassessing where employees work for several months, with the company's leader publicly advocating for office-based working. Although relocating isn't always a problem for new starters, many mid-career workers are hesitant to move due to personal and financial challenges – a move would mean uprooting families, children switching schools and partners seeking other jobs. The report suggests that workers have 30 days to decide, followed by a 60-day period to relocate or resign. It also claims that those who refuse to relocate will not be receiving severance packages. Amazon contested this, adding that teammates will receive relocation support, and that timelines for relocations could vary by case. Amazon's relocation trend has already been ongoing for more than a year, with CEO Andy Jassy previously claiming that in-person working boost ad-hoc interactions and, therefore, productivity.

"We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," Jassy said. Amazon now requires workers to come to the office five days per week, but that policy got delayed at the end of 2024 due to a lack of readiness – there simply weren't enough desks. "We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances," a company spokesperson stated. Some workers worry that the policy shift could be an effort to push workers away from the company – although thousands lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon's layoffs in the years that followed have been relatively small (compared with other giants in the industry). An Amazon spokesperson stressed that the policy is not new, but that it's taking a team-by-team approach to in-office working, and that relative to the number of workers the company has overall, the proportion affected is small.

Title: Microsoft to cut thousands more jobs, mainly in sales

Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs, mainly in sales, amid growing fears that AI advances are accelerating the replacement of human roles across the industry, Bloomberg reports. The cuts follow a previous round in May, which saw approximately 6,000 roles eliminated. Microsoft has been ramping up its AI investments to strengthen its position as enterprises across industries rush to integrate the technology into their operations. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend around $80 billion in fiscal 2025, largely on building data centers to support AI training and cloud-based applications. Adding to industry unease, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week that generative AI and AI agents are expected to shrink the company’s corporate workforce over time. AI is being used as an excuse for layoffs this year, but there may be more to it than what meets the eye. “One, we are still rebalancing employee counts from the over-hiring of the past decade,” said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst of Amalgam Insights. “Tech companies were hiring with the assumption that they would grow at ridiculous rates that have not come to pass. Also, some tech companies think they can simply get rid of salespeople, especially in cash-cow industries where renewals seem to come in with little to no effort. Whether that is actually true or not, we are about to find out.”The job cuts may also signal concerns about the near-term revenue potential of AI, Park said. While Microsoft is under pressure to invest heavily in AI to sustain its stock valuation, it may be turning to short-term operating expense reductions to support its financial performance. “The planned $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure is especially interesting because those numbers assume a massive number of people will adopt Microsoft-related AI products,” Park said. “Are 50 million+ people willing to pay an additional amount on Microsoft products to support AI? That is a massive bet that has been completely unjustified by the current AI market today.”Others point out that the company is betting on a long-term inflection in enterprise workload patterns driven by GenAI, but current adoption patterns remain volatile. “Reports of Microsoft pausing or renegotiating data center leases reflect a prudent but necessary response to these uncertainties,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “If workloads fail to scale or regulatory barriers increase, Microsoft, and by extension, other hyperscalers, could face underutilized infrastructure, prompting pricing recalibrations or service tier stratification.” The focus on sales roles in the planned cuts is notable, with analysts saying it reflects a broader shift in how enterprise sales functions are evolving. “The rise of AI copilots, telemetry-rich self-service portals, and data-driven journey mapping is reducing the need for large in-region sales teams,” Gogia said. “Microsoft’s realignment is part of a broader pattern also visible in Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.” However, while AI can personalize interactions at scale, it lacks the relational depth required in strategic deal-making, compliance negotiation, and multi-stakeholder orchestration, Gogia added.

Title: Microsoft Reportedly Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs Next Month

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the plans. Details about the layoffs are scarce, but Bloomberg says it will be announced early next month once Microsoft’s fiscal year ends. The cuts will impact multiple departments, but Microsoft's sales team is expected to take the biggest hit. The report arrives just a month after Microsoft removed 6,000 jobs across various departments and seniority levels. It was done to reduce management layers and “best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft said at the time. As of June 2024, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, and 45,000 of them were in sales and marketing. According to Bloomberg, the previous round of layoffs had largely left the sales and marketing teams untouched. In April, however, the company informed employees that it plans to use third-party firms for the marketing of software to small and mid-size customers. This strategy could help Microsoft reduce operational costs by relying on gig workers for short-term campaigns instead of full-time staff. Microsoft has also vowed to invest over $80 billion in data centers for AI development, but it’s unclear if that has anything to do with the back-to-back layoffs. The months ahead may be tough for tech workers, with more layoffs looming across major firms. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just announced that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer. Intel is also planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles.

Title: Microsoft reportedly set to cut thousands of jobs, with sales roles particularly at risk

Microsoft is warming up for more redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is preparing to cut thousands of jobs as part of its ongoing cost-cutting shakeup as the company continues to spend big on AI. A new Bloomberg report says if confirmed, the layoffs could be announced in early July after the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end on June 30, 2025. Sales teams could be the worst affected, but the redundancies could span other departments as Microsoft looks to reduce employment-related expenses. The company has already cut thousands of workers off in these post-pandemic years. In May 2025, it cut 6,000 of its workers, equating to around 3% of its roughly 228,000 headcount, in an effort to reduce inefficiencies by removing middle management tiers. A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024. In April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms – an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month. Despite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations. TechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response. While highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty. Key rivals like Amazon and Google have also been making regular adjustments to their headcounts to optimize costs and output.

Microsoft is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of employees early next month following the closure of its 2025 fiscal year. According to a report from Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, the layoffs will mostly impact sales team, though the timing of the announcement could still change. In May, Microsoft already laid off 3 percent of its workforce, with the job cuts affecting approximately 6,000 people. In January, the company also laid off employees working on security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming.

Currently, the company is also investing heavily in developing its AI infrastructure, and it is on track to spend over $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s recent job cuts in May primarily affected software engineers, as up to 30% of the code for some of the company’s projects is now being written by AI. And the Redmond giant isn’t the only Big Tech company to reduce its workforce amid the ongoing AI boom. In a note to employees shared on Tuesday (via the Wall Street Journal), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI developments will force the company to adapt its structure in the coming years. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

NEW YORK – Microsoft is planning to axe thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as part of the company’s latest move to trim its workforce amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence. The cuts are expected to be announced early in July, following the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions will not exclusively affect sales teams, and the timing could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. The company declined to comment. The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft told employees it planned to use third-party firms to handle more sales of software to small and mid-size customers. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said on June 17 that the roll-out of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion (S$102.8 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The company had 228,000 workers at the end of June 2024, 45,000 of them in sales and marketing. Microsoft often restructures teams and announces other changes near the end of its fiscal year, which closes in June.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just got brutally honest about AI — and other bosses may follow his lead

Time Published: 2025-06-18T22:39:50Z

Amazon's CEO just said the quiet part out loud: AI is coming for plenty of jobs — and other bosses may soon follow his lead. On Tuesday, Andy Jassy said in a memo that employees should figure out "how to get more done with scrappier teams" and that the move toward AI would eventually "reduce our total corporate workforce." Amazon, with about 1.5 million workers, is the second-largest private employer in the US. Workplace commentators told Business Insider that Jassy's candor may prompt other leaders to feel comfortable telling their employees who — or what — will replace them. Marlo Lyons, an author and certified executive coach, said Amazon's directness might encourage other companies to follow suit. "I think if you have a big company that's talking about AI, then it does make it easier for smaller companies to talk about AI — this is basically culture modeling," she told BI. "In some ways, it might scare you, but at the same time, it should make you say, 'OK, at least my company's being honest to me about it,'" Lyons said. Other CEOs have also become increasingly transparent about AI expectations, although few have explicitly said it would reduce their existing workforce. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said in a memo in April that "AI usage is now a baseline expectation," and that before managers make a hire, they must first prove that AI couldn't do the job better. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in December last year that the fintech had stopped hiring because "AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do." Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that AI agents were already beginning to act like junior-level coworkers and may soon be able to deliver business solutions. "It'll send shivers down the backs of employees," said Cary Cooper, professor of organizational psychology and health at Manchester Business School in the UK, of the Jassy memo. "I think it'll open it up for HR to now have discussions with senior management about how we deal with this — the introduction of AI in our business." Cooper warned companies should be specific with staff about which jobs might be affected and what retraining opportunities are available, or risk "regrettable turnover" — losing the talent they most want to keep. Thomas Roulet, professor of organisational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told BI that linking layoffs with AI was not new — even if Jassy's openness felt like a turning point. "Firms do not hesitate to use AI as a reason to downsize, whether it is an excuse or an opportunity," he said. "Very often, they downsize before even thinking what they will replace with AI, due to market pressures." "AI is a great scapegoat for a lot of unpopular strategic choices at the moment," Roulet added. "There is enormous pressure on companies to show that they are able to replace employees with AI tools," Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at The Wharton School, told BI. "But the evidence indicates that it is very difficult to do so." Klarna, for example, made headlines in 2022 when the company laid off 700 employees, mostly customer service agents, in favor of AI. In May, the financial services company had to hire some back to improve its services. In Roulet's view, many companies that have already cut jobs in favor of AI were moving too fast. "Unfortunately, many firms think of workforce reduction and engage with such reductions before they even think about AI replacement," said Roulet. "The reality is that bringing in AI into work takes a lot of learning cycles and trial and error — it does not appear clearly overnight." Jump to

Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion ($123 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The layoffs are expected to be announced early next month, following the end of the tech giant's fiscal year, the report said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The job cuts will not exclusively affect the sales teams, and the timing could still change, the report added. Microsoft had 228,000 workers as of June last year.

Tech giants are increasingly focusing on advancing AI and looking for ways the technology can be used to boost efficiency and performance. Due to the rapid expansion and adaptation of the technology, companies are relying more on AI for enhancement and, as a result, putting more heed to automating processes to streamline operations. Many companies, on account of the changing dynamics and agility of the market, have laid off their staff to create more resources and space for artificial intelligence. Now, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, warns its employees about jobs being cut in the coming years due to the growing focus on AI. The tech industry seems to be undergoing a significant shift with companies extensively embracing AI and automation to boost efficiency and streamline their operations. Due to this broader trend in the market, we see many of the roles either turning redundant or being replaced by AI, resulting in many tech giants undergoing some major organizational restructuring. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also seems to be part of the changing trends. In a memo sent to employees, he informed them that the company's corporate headcount is expected to be cut down over the next few years as part of the shifting industry and growing focus on AI advancement across the company. The CEO shared: As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. This is not the first time the company has intended to lay off its staff members. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees. Recently, the divisions impacted by the job cuts were the devices and service group and the books division. Jassy, while emphasizing that the change is due to a wider adoption of AI and using the technology for further advancement, also took the chance to emphasize the current work the company is doing in this regard. Andy Jassy shared about Amazon's progress in terms of AI, as it has so far developed more than 1,000 AI applications and services. He also took a chance to brag that this is yet only a small fraction of what the company has in store, emphasizing the company's deeper investment in the technology. AI is not only serving to be a tool for advancement and operational efficiency, but also a key driver in the organizational restructuring of many companies today, and we could see even more companies opting in this direction.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Warns Employees that AI Will Reduce Company's Workforce

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in a memo to employees this week that the company expects AI to reduce its workforce in the coming years, affecting both white-collar and warehouse workers. The Washington Post reports that Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. As Breitbart News previously reported, Amodei has dire predictions about the future employment of office workers: The Anthropic CEO said AI companies and the government need to stop “sugar-coating” what will happen next, which he warns could be a mass erasure of jobs in a variety of fields, and the axing of half of all entry-level white collar jobs, which Amodei says will lead to a 10-20 percent spike in unemployment in the next one to five years. “We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,” Amodei said. “I don’t think this is on people’s radar.” “It’s a very strange set of dynamics, where we’re saying: ‘You should be worried about where the technology we’re building is going,’” the Anthropic CEO added, acknowledging that he is building the very technology he suspects will soon and swiftly transform society. While economists have generally found that previous waves of AI and automation technology had little overall effect on employment, the latest advances in AI have prompted suggestions that this pattern may be changing. A recent drop in the number of computer programmers has fueled speculation that AI is already beginning to impact the job market. Amazon, along with other large tech companies, made significant layoffs in 2023 after hiring sprees during the coronavirus pandemic. Since becoming CEO in 2021, Jassy has focused on doing more with less, creating a money-saving metric called “cost to serve” to drive down the company’s expenses in delivering goods and services to customers. In his memo, Jassy encouraged employees to embrace AI and to educate themselves about the technology to remain competitive in the changing landscape. He wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” The memo also highlighted Amazon’s own AI products, including chatbots for shopping, tools for generative AI ads, and Alexa+, an AI-enhanced version of the company’s virtual assistant Alexa.

Title: Diamond Comics' Claim AENT Poached Staff "Fails As A Matter Of Law"

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond AENT says that Ad Populum's claim against them for poaching staff from Diamond and breaking NDAs "fails as a matter of law" Once upon a time, Diamond Comic Distributors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and held an auction to divide its assets. Alliance Entertainment (AENT) won that auction, with Universal Distribution and Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop coming second as joint bidders. The courts (eventually) declared AENT the winner, but they suddenly pulled out, citing that they had been misled. So the back-up bidders won the auction, with Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop taking Diamond Comic Distributors while Universal got other associated companies. AENT then sued Diamond, alleging fraud over contracts. Then Ad Populum sued AENT, alleging the breaking of NDAs and non-hiring agreements, after AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Those staff members were: Now, AENT is making the case with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore that Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop has no legal standing to enforce the NDA, as it was not a party to the agreement nor assigned its rights. And claims that the NDA was signed between AENT, Diamond, and Diamond's bankruptcy lawyer, Raymond James. AENT notes that a cease-and-desist letter sent on the 2nd of June, seen below, came from Diamond, not Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop. They state that "prior to the Auction, AENT entered into the NDA with Raymond James, on behalf of itself and DCD. The NDA was entered into because AENT 'requested certain information (oral, written, electronic or otherwise) relating to or concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.' The NDA recognized that AENT signed the agreement 'for the benefit of [DCD] and Raymond James and their respective successors and assigns.' The Complaint does not allege that DCD or Raymond James assigned the NDA to Sparkle Pop. Nor did the Debtors assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as part of the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." They also note that Ad Populum's own evidence proves that AENT did not solicit Diamond's former employees and that Diamond's "internal records reveal that most of the employees in question were terminated as part of a mass-layoff on May 16, 2025, or were seeking alterative employment opportunities months before they resigned, as employee morale tanked and instability permeated." AENT Bruce Ogilvie makes a declaration, which is included in the filing under oath, backing much of this up, saying "Prior to the Auction, AENT entered into a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc, on behalf of itself and Debtor DCD. Importantly, Ad Populum is not a party to the NDA. When I signed the NDA on behalf of AENT, it was an agreement between AENT and DCD and its subsidiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries. Further, the Debtors did not assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as partof the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." "Indeed, counsel for Debtors sent my attorneys a letter, dated June 2, 2025, incorrectly claiming certain alleged breaches of the NDA by AENT caused by AENT's employment of certain former employees of DCD. AENT denies such allegations and maintains that its actions did not violate the NDA or interfere with the business of any party, including Sparkle Pop. It is noteworthy that the letter did not come from Sparkle Pop, but rather DCD and its related Debtors—the only parties to and intended beneficiaries of the NDA." The legal response is summed up, saying "the Complaint and the Motion… fail as a matter of law." There's more, much more to come, of course. Including how my work for Bleeding Cool is being cited in this case. Well, you know how I like to make everything about me, right? But for now, that cease and desist letter. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

After eliminating nearly 27,000 jobs in 2023, Amazon is preparing for another round of layoffs. This time, the job cuts stem from the rapid growth and efficiency of AI. "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees. The memo didn't specify the departments that would be impacted, but it highlighted AI agents as key to the company's future. They can engage in deep research, write code, and "change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers," Jassy said. Currently, Amazon has over 1,000 generative AI services and apps in progress. In the future, the company hopes to use agents that can act as "teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work," Jassy added. The Amazon executive didn't provide a timeline for the layoffs. He, however, stated that efficiency gains from AI will reduce the company's total corporate workforce in the next few years. Jobs of some warehouse workers and delivery agents may also be at risk. The company started testing humanoid robots at a Seattle warehouse in 2023. These robots could move, grasp, and handle items just like human workers. More recently, the e-commerce giant was rumored to be testing similar robots for doorstep delivery. The robots are expected to hop on the back of a Rivian van and step out to drop off packages. The Prime Air drone service, on the other hand, has already begun delivering iPhones, Galaxy phones, AirPods, and more in less than 60 minutes in eligible areas. In April, Duolingo had also announced AI-driven job cuts. CEO Luis von Ahn wanted to make the language learning platform an AI-first company and gradually stop using contractors for work AI can handle. However, after facing backlash from users, von Ahn backtracked on his plans, stating, "I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do." Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Amazon CEO says AI set to take jobs due to "efficiency" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has announced advancements in AI, and the technology's integration across many of the company's operations, will likely reduce the firm's headcount over the next five years due to efficiency gains. In a letter to workers, CEO Andy Jassy boasted that more than 1,000 AI services and apps area already in progress or built, and many more are to come. Jassy name-dropped a few of the successful deployments and upcoming rollouts, including its next-generation smart personal assistant Alexa+, the AI Shopping Assistant, seller tools and advertiser tools. Ultimately, artificial intelligence could end up changing the nature of work, requiring fewer people in some roles but more in others. The ecommerce giant has already laid off an estimated 27,000 workers since 2022, including recent cuts in devices, services and books divisions, but it seems that widespread tech layoffs could be far from over for Amazonians. AI has also proven instrumental in allowing Amazon to improve its inventory, forecasting, robot efficiency and customer service, but Jassy's letter remained consistent with one key theme – a strong emphasis on internal productivity improvements through the use of generative and agentic AI. With capabilities spanning task completion, research, code writing and workflow automation, Jassy sees AI agents are critical for faster innovation and better customer experiences, however the downside of that is that the tech will enable leaner teams to achieve more, reducing the need for as many workers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite the threat of AI taking their roles, Jassy urged workers to be "curious" about the tech, experiment and innovate with it, and further their learning. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.," Jassy explained. "It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce." Jassy's comment about knowing where this nets out in the future is a relevant one. Although many experts predict that AI could lead to net job creation, it could mean that some companies (like Amazon) end up reducing their headcount, while others see growth.

Title: Employees were already freaked out about AI — Amazon just proved them right

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not. On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant. In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job." Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend. "I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill." Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces. While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said. Jump to

Title: Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy's memo about AI killing corporate jobs

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees on Tuesday that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains" as the driving force. Amazon employees weren't having it. Across internal Slack channels, Amazon's white-collar workers tore into Jassy's message, taking aim at his leadership and unapologetic push for AI, according to messages seen by Business Insider. BI viewed dozens of messages found across three different internal channels, which include thousands of employees in total. The criticism was widespread across the channels. Some called for a shift in the company's mindset and warned of the risks of relying too much on AI. Others voiced blunt concerns about looming layoffs, while a few demanded that leadership share in the fallout. "There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years," one person wrote in Slack. Some Amazon employees seemed to agree with Jassy's move. One person wrote that middle management in general could be replaced by Amazon's AI app and "no one would notice," alluding to the company's decision to reduce management layers this year. "At least he said the quiet part out loud," another employee wrote. "We all knew it but now it's clearly part of the plan." An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. One key debate centered on how AI should be positioned within a corporate environment. Many of the internal Slack messages noted that a 50% productivity boost from AI gives companies two options: Reduce the workforce and maintain current output, or keep the team intact and grow the business. Amazon, in this case, is choosing to do the same with less, they argued. "We need to lead the change in reframing AI as partners (even teammates or colleagues) rather than AI as replacements or tools," one person wrote. "It's a slightly different vision than the one Andy alludes to." Another person wrote that Jassy was defining success as "a smaller corporate workforce," not in terms of customer satisfaction. BI previously reported that Amazon was freezing its hiring budget for its retail business this year. "He, as the CEO, has shown he can deliver on one of those things and not the other," this person wrote. Others voiced concerns about leaning too heavily on AI without proper safeguards. While some found summary tools useful, employees warned that AI isn't always a reliable source of truth. It can lead to poor decisions and a future in which people turn to AI to solve problems it caused in the first place, they said. "It's dangerous, and it will have real consequences," one of the employees wrote. Some employees questioned whether Tuesday's memo signaled more layoffs ahead. One said any message from Jassy filled them with instant "deep dread," while another said they saw it as yet another example of his relentless focus on cost cutting over the years. "This seems to be the [antithesis] of Think Big, and is part of a continual trend that our CEO doesn't seem to have a vision for the company other than 'do what we do today cheaper, and also AI will happen,'" one of the people wrote. Some employees took a cynical view of the role of senior executives, questioning why AI-driven cuts seem to target rank-and-file workers while top leadership remains untouched. Amazon's senior S-team, for example, has only expanded under Jassy's watch. "Will it result in less SVPs?" one of the people wrote. Have a tip?

Title: Andy Jassy is the perfect Amazon CEO for the looming Gen AI (cost-cutting) era
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/17/andy-jassy-perfect-amazon-ceo-generative-ai-cost-cutting-memo/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T22:44:56Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told hundreds of thousands of his employees on Tuesday that generative AI is coming for their jobs and that their best bet is to embrace the technology. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. But no matter how geeked Amazon employees get over new AI tools, Jassy also made a point to note that there’s not room on the bus for everybody: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” As I read this note—and I recommend reading the whole thing—some questions quickly came to mind. Are some parts of Amazon’s vast organization highly resistant to the new technology and perhaps in need of a public nudge (or kick in the butt), in Jassy’s view? Seems likely. Is the public memo a wink-wink to Wall Street that the company’s heavy AI investments will eventually pay off by delivering significant cost reductions? I suppose. Is the note meant to provide some glossy AI cover for imminent or future mass layoffs that may have nothing, or just something, to do with AI actually eating some corporate tasks? I guess that’s possible too, though I find it less likely. And are the parts of the essay where Jassy methodically outlines the various ways Amazon already uses gen AI—a ritutal he has performed publicly on more than one occasion this year—designed to thrust Amazon into AI-dominated news cycles that often feature many other companies not named Amazon? Perhaps. No matter the exact goal or impetus, and Amazon isn’t saying what exactly the impetus for this public memo was, Jassy seems like the right leader for the current job—especially on the cost-cutting, or, as he referred to it in his annual shareholder letter in April, the “cost avoidance and productivity” bucket of gen-AI impact. I don’t mean to discount Jassy’s ability to lead on the innovation front. He transformed and led Amazon Web Services, after all, from its infancy into the behemoth cloud provider it is today. But ever since taking over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy has also become the company’s chief cost-cutter and has appeared comfortable in the role. He has overseen the largest corporate layoffs in company history in recent years, joining other Big Tech companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Salesforce, which all slashed headcounts after overhiring in the pandemic. His logistic teams have rejiggered the U.S. warehouse network and inventory systems to reduce the cost of getting each product to a customer. And he’s also pushed teams to accelerate the automation of some warehouse tasks, which over time could allow the company to do more with less—or at least more with the same. Some of these moves were necessitated by Bezos handing over to Jassy a bloated and sometimes wasteful company when the CEO transition happened nearly four years ago. But it also appears to this close observer of the company that Jassy is quite comfortable in the role; though whether he enjoys it or simply accepts it I don’t know. So, whether Amazon’s AI jobs shakeout turns out to be a painful retrenching, a gradual recalibration, or something else entirely, recent history seems to suggest the company, if nothing else, has the right man for the job.

Title: Amazon Preps Employees for Layoffs by Talking Up the Power of AI Agents

Amazon appears to be soft-launching its next round of layoffs. In a message to employees shared Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talked highly of the company’s embrace of artificial intelligence tools across its company, and said that it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. That is only slightly veiled corporate speak for “get ready to be replaced.” Jassy called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that will change the way the company operates, and said Amazon is already using it in “virtually every corner of the company.” According to Jassy, Amazon already has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, and said, “thatâs a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” So it’s clear the company is all in on AI. Amazon previously said it would commit $100 billion to investing in AI technologies this year. As for humans? Well, it seems Amazon is not so committed to them long-term. Jassy told the company’s 1.5 million employees that generative AI will “change the way our work is done,” and said that the company will ultimately “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” The underlying message: you might soon be out of work. “Itâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote. The CEO did offer his workers, some of whom are likely wondering just how long they’ll be employed, how to potentially survive the next round of layoffs (or, maybe more likely, help train their future replacements). “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your teamâs brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has been in the process of stripping its workforce down to the bones in departments it seems to care less about. The company cut about 100 people from its devices and services team earlier this year, and around the same number from its books department. Per CNBC, it has laid off about 27,000 people since 2022 and has its eyes on further cuts. It’s hard to look at Jassy’s AI-forward message as much else other than an indicator that more layoffs are just around the corner. It’s possible the AI hype is just a cynical attempt to position itself as being an industry leader when the real goal is cutting salaries to boost stock price. It wouldn’t be the first company to try to go all-in on AI at the expense of human labor. Earlier this year, Klarna announced it was bringing back human customer service representatives after trying to leave the task to AI after finding the outcomes aren’t great and people don’t really like dealing with AI agents.

Title: Amazon CEO Says AI Will Lead to Layoffs and ‘Change the Way Our Work Is Done,’ Tells Employees: ‘Be Curious About AI, Educate Yourself’

Andy Jassy tells employees to 'be curious about AI, educate yourself' By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon chief executive officer Andy Jassy outlined a near future where AI will “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” — but at the same time, he said, the technology will cut the overall number of jobs at the ecommerce giant. In a memo Tuesday to Amazon employees, Jassy shared “Some thoughts on Generative AI.” “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Related Stories Xbox's Next-Gen Console to Be Powered by AMD (Gaming News Roundup) Amy Poehler Says 'SNL' Actors 'All Played People We Should Not Have... I Misappropriated, I Appropriated': Everything in Comedy Has an 'Expiration Date' According to an Amazon spokesperson, Jassy’s reference to a reduction in workforce does not necessarily mean layoffs; for example, the company could offer voluntary early retirement packages. Popular on Variety As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. Jassy encouraged Amazon employees to “be curious about AI” and “educate yourself.” “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy wrote. Nine months ago, Jassy informed Amazon’s corporate staffers they were expected to report to the office five days per week, so the company will be “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” Today, Amazon is investing “quite expansively” in generative AI, according to Jassy’s June 17 memo. The company has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built to date, “but at our scale, that’s a small fraction of what we will ultimately build,” the CEO said. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI. I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners, and how we work,” Jassy wrote. Jassy took over the role of Amazon’s CEO in July 2021 from founder Jeff Bezos, who is now executive chairman. After joining the company in 1997, Jassy started the Amazon Web Services group and led it for nearly 20 years. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/17/2025 1:00:18 PM PDT by Cronos As thousands of young graduates prepare to take their first steps on the job market, an unexpected obstacle stands in their way: artificial intelligence. The technological promise that was supposed to relieve us of repetitive tasks seems, paradoxically, to be blocking the access of new generations to the professional world. The broken path to employment Traditionally, young people start their careers with internships, junior positions or simple assignments that allow them to learn and work their way up. But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

Used to be that kids and teens learned the value of paid work by mowing lawns, delivering newspapers, and working in fast food stores. Now all those jobs are held by adult migrants. Early every morning, I see pickup trucks delivering the Los Angeles Times (often one adult at the wheel, and one in the back tossing the papers). Migrants do landscaping. And adult migrants now make a lifetime "career" by working at a fast food joint. 14 posted on 06/17/2025 1:22:45 PM PDT by Angelino97 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Besides AI, there are many things which will contribute to a financial, as well as intellectual and cultural divide in this country. As a small example - my son just graduated college and started his first job. He faces a wide choice of many different programs offered by the employer - from 401K, IRAs, to 5 levels of Obama health-care, to HSA, to FSA, to disability insurance to extended disability insurance, all of which have differing costs with different levels of risk/reward. Then there is the complexity of the tax code as well, IRAs He can figure it out easily enough himself, and then track, manage, and optimize these programs over the next several decades of his career/life. But what about those 50% of Americans with below 99 IQ? It seems the complexity of life, money, finance, debt and law will almost necessarily lead them to be working drones - or government dependents. 15 posted on 06/17/2025 1:23:44 PM PDT by PGR88 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Well, if it is taking their jobs now, it will be takin the jobs from those who currently have jobs when they are no longer needed.

In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them.

Title: Amazon CEO Tells Staffers to Expect AI-Related Layoffs: ‘It Should Change the Way Our Work Is Done’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-ceo-warns-staff-ai-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T19:26:53Z

“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Andy Jassy says in a Tuesday memo Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed staffers that they should anticipate potential layoffs across the company as they expedite the implementation of artificial intelligence in an effort to boost and/or improve the customer experience. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in a message to employees on Tuesday. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The potential layoffs could impact many across Amazon’s workforce, which consists of about 1,556,000 full-time and part-time staffers globally. Jassy mentioned that Amazon now has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress, adding that the amount is just a small fraction of what the company would ideally like to build. While noting that Amazon has already shifted into an AI-leaning model, highlighting its rollout of Alexa+ and the use of its AI shopping assistant, Jassy further encouraged workers to become “curious about AI.” “Educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy, who started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, wrote. For now, he shared that Amazon has only scratched the surface in its heavy pivot to AI-powered tools and resources, but added that he believes the technology will “change how we all work and live.” “Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time,” his message continued. “There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast.” Lastly, the executive shared that he’s excited about the future of AI at the company and that he hopes his staff will take part in its journey. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI,” Jassy concluded. “I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners and how we work.”

Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says he expects the company’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the retail and cloud-computing giant uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Generative AI and AI-powered software agents “should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday that laid out his thinking about how the emerging technology will transform the workplace. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” From the start of the AI boom, people inside and outside the industry have raised concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to replace workers. Those concerns have only grown as tech companies introduce more sophisticated AI systems that can write code and field online tasks on a user’s behalf. Shopify Inc. told employees that requests for new headcount will require an explanation as to why AI can’t do the job. Duolingo Inc. said it would “gradually stop” using contractors to do work that artificial intelligence can handle. And Microsoft Corp. recently announced a round of layoffs that hit software developers hardest. Dario Amodei, CEO of OpenAI rival Anthropic, recently warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to spike to as high as 20% over the next five years. Amazon, which has prioritized automation in logistics and headquarters roles for years, is investing heavily in AI. Jassy, in his letter, rattled off some of those initiatives, including the Alexa+ voice software, a shopping assistant, and tools for developers and businesses sold by the Amazon Web Services cloud unit. Inside the company, Amazon has used AI tools for inventory placement, customer service and product listings. Jassy encouraged employees to “experiment with AI whenever you can.” “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he said. Amazon is the largest private U.S. employer after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but about 350,000 of them have corporate jobs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
