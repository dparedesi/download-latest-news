The tech layoff wave seems to have swept over hundreds of thousands of professionals this week, with big names like Apple and HP announcing major job cuts. HP Inc., on Tuesday, November 25, said that it is likely to cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs worldwide by 2028. The Palo Alto-based tech giant said that the move is in alignment with its larger plan to streamline operations and embrace AI to ramp up product development, boost productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. As part of the announcement, HP CEO Enrique Lores said that the company’s staff from teams working on product development, internal operations, and customer support will be impacted. The CEO spoke about the potential impact of layoffs during a media briefing. He added that the company expects to create about $1 billion in gross run rate savings over the next three years. Earlier this year, HP sacked over 2,000 of its workforce as part of its previously announced restructuring plan. Similarly, on Tuesday, it was reported that Apple Inc. eliminated dozens of sales roles to streamline its product offerings for businesses, schools, and government agencies. Reportedly, the latest round of layoffs at Apple impacted account managers and staff responsible for handling Apple’s briefing centres for institutional meetings and product demos. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone maker confirmed its reshuffling, asserting that it is making changes to connect more with customers. The company also said that the affected employees can apply for new roles within Apple. Reportedly, Apple notified the affected workers over the past few weeks. The job cuts impacted across the sales organisation, with some teams being hit severely. However, Apple has refrained from divulging the actual number of employees impacted. The latest job cuts come weeks after the tech giant slashed about 20 roles in its teams based in Australia and New Zealand. The latest development comes at a time when Apple’s revenue has been on the rise and it is set to make sales worth $140 billion in the December quarter. In October, it was reported that Apple topped $4 trillion in market value for the first time, making it the third big tech company to hit the milestone. While internally, it has been reported that Apple is viewing these layoffs as part of its vision to streamline its sales teams and reduce the overlapping of roles. However, some reports also suggest that the move is likely an effort to transfer more of its sales to third-party resellers, which Apple terms as ‘channels’. Companies often opt for indirect sellers to reduce internal costs like salaries. It needs to be noted that unlike other tech giants, Apple views layoffs as a ‘last resort’ and is seldom seen announcing massive job cuts compared to Google, Amazon, or Meta. According to layoff.fyi, the month of October saw 21 companies lay off as many as 18,510 employees, with companies like Amazon announcing that it was planning to lay off over 14,000 corporate workers with its burgeoning investments in AI. The e-commerce giant said that it is cutting jobs to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic as it looks at boosting its investments in AI. This would be the biggest corporate job cuts in the history of Amazon. Meanwhile, in November, 20 tech companies have so far laid off 4,545 employees. The biggest layoffs this month were carried out by chip-design software maker Synopsys, which laid off about 2,000 of its employees, constituting nearly 10 per cent of its workforce. A regulatory filing revealed that the company trimmed its workforce in an effort to redirect its investments towards growth opportunities. This year so far 1,114,124 employees have been handed over the pink slip by 237 tech companies. MEA spokesperson rejects Pakistan's criticism of PM Modi's Ayodhya Ram Temple flag-hoisting, calling it a significant moment. Jaiswal said the statement shows Pakistan's "deeply stained record of bigotry" and urges them to address their own human rights issues instead of lecturing others.

PHOTO: HP/FACEBOOK Published Nov 26, 2025, 08:45 AM Updated Nov 26, 2025, 07:08 PM San Francisco – Computer and printer-maker HP announced on Nov 25 a sweeping restructuring plan that will eliminate about 10 per cent of its workforce globally, as the company pivots towards arti­ficial intelligence (AI) to boost efficiency. According to its latest earnings report, the tech giant expects to reduce­ its global headcount by between 4,000 and 6,000 employees to focus on adopting AI to increase innovation and customer satisfaction. In response to The Straits Times’ queries on Singapore layoffs, HP Singapore declined to comment. HP’s move reflects a growing trend across the tech sector, where companies are investing heavily in AI development while using the technology to reduce operational costs. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have announced workforce reductions over the past two years, with many citing the need to reallocate resources, including jobs, towards AI initiatives. Industry analysts say AI automation is particularly affecting roles in customer support, content moderation, data entry and certain computer programming tasks. HP said its AI plan aims to generate approximately US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2028. The company has been working to transform its business model amid changing demand patterns in the PC and printing markets. HP chief executive Enrique Lores told The Wall Street Journal that the company plans to raise the prices of its computers and work with new suppliers to help offset the higher costs of AI computing. In its latest quarter, HP posted a profit of US$795 million, compared with US$906 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.2 per cent to US$14.64 billion, topping analyst estimates with sales in PCs offsetting a decline in printer sales. Since opening its first factory in Singapore in 1970, HP’s presence in the Republic has evolved into a strategic innovation hub, with research and development across print, personal systems and smart manufacturing applications. It was last reported in September 2021 that HP Singapore employed more than 3,000 people. Its current Singapore headcount was not disclosed.

Title: Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance

UPDATED 18:51 EST / NOVEMBER 25 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the personal computer makers Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. were heading in opposite directions in the after-hours market today after offering contrasting guidance for the next three months. In the case of Dell, which is still led by its namesake founder Michael Dell (pictured) investors looked bullish after the company forecast stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue thanks to what it said is strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. HP, on the other hand, offered a forecast that came in below Wall Street’s estimates and said it’s planning to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 people over the next two years, accounting for up to 10% of its total workforce. Dell’s results in the quarter just gone weren’t great, as they missed the Street’s targets on revenue. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.59 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.47. But it could only deliver revenue of $27.01 billion, up 11% from a year ago but shy of the $27.13 billion estimate. All told, Dell delivered $1.54 billion in net income, rising from $1.17 billion in the same quarter last year. For the current quarter, things are looking better, though, as Dell is expecting about $31.5 billion in total sales at the midpoint of its forecast range, well ahead of the Street’s $27.59 billion target. The company is also forecasting healthy earnings of around $3.50 per share, surpassing the $3.21 forecast. AI is the primary reason for Dell’s bullish forecast. The company said it’s raising its overall revenue forecast for AI server shipments to $25 billion, up from an earlier forecast of just $20 billion. It also boosted its full-year revenue target to $111.7 billion, up from $107 billion. Wall Street reacted positively to the report, with Dell’s stock gaining more than 3% in after-hours trading. Dell has in fact become a major bellwether for the AI infrastructure market and its overall health, as it’s one of the top manufacturers of server systems featuring Nvidia Corp.’s powerful graphics processing units. Most of its customers are large enterprises, government agencies and so-called “neocloud” providers such as CoreWeave Inc. It sells fewer servers to the big cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC, also known as “hyperscalers,” which often buy GPUs directly from Nvidia. Still, there’s an enormous market for Dell’s servers, and it said it’s expecting to ship about $9.4 billion worth in the current quarter. But that doesn’t include a recent deal it announced that will see it ship Nvidia GB300-based systems to a neocloud company called Iren Ltd., which subsequently plans to rent their capacity to Microsoft Corp. Dell’s server business is part of its broader Infrastructure Solutions Group, which delivered $14.11 billion in sales during the previous quarter, in-line with the Street’s expectations. Within that segment, server sales and networking parts generated $10.1 billion in sales, up 37% on an annual basis, with $5.6 billion spent on AI servers. The company also sold $4 billion worth of storage systems during the quarter. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “Dell is winning in AI because of our unique ability to engineer bespoke high-performance solutions, rapidly deploy large, complex clusters, and provide global support.” Dell’s other main business is, of course, PCs and laptops. They fall in the company’s Client Solutions Group, which reported revenue of $12.48 billion in the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier but trailing the Street’s forecast of $12.65 billion. Clarke said on a conference call with analysts that the company expects PC and laptop sales to get a boost from Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows 10 last month. Many enterprises have only just started refreshing their portfolios as they scramble to upgrade to Windows 11. “Dell is riding the AI wave with its server business growing by an impressive rate,” said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research. “Servers and networking are now poised to overtake the company’s once-biggest revenue stream, namely PCs. That’s because of AI. The company is on the rise, and investors were pleased to see its profitability grow along with its revenue.” As for HP, the main focus of investors wasn’t its results, but rather its glum forecast and the fact that the company intends to lay off so many thousands of workers. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 93 cents per share on sales of $14.64 billion, edging past the Street’s targets of 92 cents and $14.48 billion in revenue, respectively. Despite the results, HP’s revenue only gained 4% from a year earlier, while net income rose slightly to $795 million in the quarter, from $763 million one year ago. The PC and printer maker’s snail’s pace revenue growth was a concern, and equally alarming for investors was the forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. HP said it’s looking for earnings of between 73 cents and 81 cents per share, short of the consensus estimate of 79 cents. For the full year, the company sees earnings at between $2.90 and $3.20 per share, trailing the analyst’s target of $3.33. The company didn’t issue any revenue guidance. In a statement, HP said its outlook reflects the additional costs that stem from current U.S. trade-related regulations and “associated mitigations” implemented by the company. HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores (pictured below) tried to put a brave face on what is a very glum picture, saying the results reinforce the power of its portfolio and the strength of the company’s teams. However, investors and analysts were much more interested in hearing about the reasons behind the company’s decision to lay off so many staff. Lores said he expects the headcount reduction to be completed by the end of the company’s fiscal 2028 year – two years from now, so it’s going to be a relatively slow process. It will help the company to realize savings of at least $1 billion in its annualized gross run rate by that time. However, it will incur approximately $650 million in charges, with a $250 million hit expected in fiscal 2026. Lores said the restructuring plan is part of an initiative that will see the company adopt more AI automation to try to accelerate product and software development. It’s planning to automate some customer support services, as well as many of its internal business processes. “We really think this is a unique opportunity we cannot miss to really continue to transform the company and continue to be competitive for the next 10, 20 years,” he told analysts on a call. “I think any work is going to be impacted by AI, and we need to take advantage of it as a company.” The layoffs come at a time when HP is facing significantly higher costs in its PC business, thanks to surging demand for chips in the AI data center industry driving up the price of memory chips. “Memory costs are currently 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,” Lores said. To counter this, Lores said the company will increase the price of many of its PCs and laptops and work with some lower-cost suppliers on ways to reduce the memory configuration of their products to offset some of these costs. However, the company still expects to see a net headwind of abut 30 cents per share in the current fiscal year, Lores said. “It is a very significant number, and this is net of all the actions that we are already putting in place,” he added. However, the company’s efforts weren’t enough to satisfy investors, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading. During the previous quarter, HP’s personal systems unit, which covers laptops and desktop PCs, delivered $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above the analyst forecast of $10.15 billion. Lores said on the call that the company expects to see sales improve following the end of support for Windows 10, explaining that this will prompt a lot of businesses to upgrade and buy new PCs. Currently, only about 60% of HP’s installed base has moved to Windows 11, the CEO pointed out. HP’s other main business is printers, which delivered $4.3 billion in sales during the quarter, down 4% from a year ago and just below the Street’s forecast. The company explained that it’s dealing with a competitive pricing environment that has put off a lot of customers from purchasing new models. Mueller told SiliconANGLE that the biggest problem for HP is that it only has two main business lines — PCs and printers, unlike Dell, which has its fast-growing data center infrastructure business. “The reliance on these two markets means HP is very exposed to supply chain shifts, and it’s currently dealing with much higher memory chip prices,” the analyst said. “However, that’s also true for its rivals and so HP needs to do better. It’ll need to convince customers that its PCs are worth paying a bit more for, or else reduce its cost base somewhere else. Investors will also be interested to see how the company’s automation efforts will make up for the reduction in full-time employees.” As of Tuesday’s market close, HP’s stock is now down 27% in the year to date, while Dell is up 7% over the same timeframe. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 15% this year. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

Title: Apple Sales Layoffs Hit Dozens Despite Record Revenue

The company frames the move as restructuring rather than financial trouble, potentially signaling a shift toward third-party resellers and new strategic priorities. When business is good, companies tend to hire more people in order to meet the demand. However, when business is bad or slow, that’s when companies conduct layoffs. But are things going badly at Apple, so much so that the company is conducting layoffs across different sales roles? That’s what’s allegedly happening, according to a report from Bloomberg. According to the report, Apple has eliminated roles primarily within its enterprise sales division. The affected positions include account managers handling corporate, education, and government clients. It also includes employees at Apple’s briefing centers, where the company hosts high-level product demonstrations for major customers. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as Apple doing badly. Instead, Apple frames these layoffs at its sales division as a restructuring to streamline operations and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. The company says it’s still hiring in other areas and has encouraged affected staff to apply for open internal positions. Some employees have been given deadlines to find new roles within Apple before receiving their severance packages. According to some affected employees, they believe the company is shifting more enterprise business to third-party resellers. This means potentially reduced salary and support costs. The government sales team appears to be hit particularly hard. The division was already struggling with federal budget constraints and a prolonged US government shutdown that slowed the closing of deals. Apple has built a reputation for treating layoffs as an absolute last resort. While competitors spent 2023 and 2024 cutting thousands of positions, Apple largely avoided massive workforce reductions. This is versus other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies slashed thousands of jobs during recent downturns. What makes these Apple sales layoffs interesting and kind of weird is the timing. The company recently reported approximately $140 billion in revenue for the December quarter. Like we said, companies tend to cut jobs when things are bad. But cutting jobs during strong financial performance sends a different message. Perhaps this is Apple’s way of diverting its resources to other investments, like in AI, where it appears to be currently struggling. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Can artificial Christmas tree companies spruce things up for next year?

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. No one wants to put tariffs on Christmas, says the National Tree Company CEO. But what happens when all of your raw materials are made outside of the U.S.? If you celebrate Christmas, there’s a good chance you are putting up a tree this year. There’s also a high probability that you are rockin’ around a fake tree. Convenience, safety, durability and cost-effectiveness contribute to 83% of households selecting an artificial tree for the season, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. And the U.S., as it turns out, has a much heavier artificial tree representation than most of the world. “About 15 to 20 million are bought every single year,” National Tree Company CEO Chris Butler said. “It’s a huge industry.” This segment of the holiday market has been impacted by a year of roller coaster tariffs, retail pullback and an uncertain consumer base. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about, ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas,’” Butler said. But, as he points out, “Zero percent of our industry is made in the U.S.” Holiday-focused companies are responding by moving production to different countries, implementing price changes, conducting promotions when possible and advocating to the government. Not just for 2025, but for Christmas seasons yet to come. The National Tree Company knows trees. Specifically, artificial ones. As one of the largest domestic wholesalers of the product, shoppers can buy directly from the company’s website, but also through large retailers including Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Macy’s and Lowe’s. As far as artificial tree consumption goes, the U.S. sports an average of one and a half trees per household, with the average purchase cycle being between five and six years. And all of the raw materials to make those trees come from China. The National Tree Company started to move its production out of China about 18 months ago for diversity and flexibility of its supply chain. The company currently sources from parts of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam, resulting in around 60% of its goods coming from outside of China this year. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas.’” Chris Butler CEO, National Tree Company So when tariffs were announced this spring, the company was expecting it, but they weren’t expecting the tariffs to be so heavy on countries other than China. “It was a bit of a shock to the system all the way around, because we were looking at 50% tariffs across the board, pretty much going from zero,” Butler said. When tariffs on China reached 145% this spring, almost all artificial tree production across this segment of the industry stopped for about 30 days. When levies on China were reduced, production started up again, but at a lower rate, Butler said. Additionally, many companies started building their supply chain sites outside of China at the same time. “It’s not difficult to set up a new factory in different countries, but once you do that, you still need the raw materials from China,” Butler said. “There was a slowing down of the supply chain this year, and hence why we think there’ll be somewhat of a shortage of supply.” The National Tree Company was able to be flexible when tariffs went back to 30%, in part because the business had been steadily investing in its supply chain systems. Even still, it was “100% by far the most challenging year ever,” Butler said. There may be better news going into 2026, however, when it comes to supply chains and tariffs. “I think it will start to stabilize,” Lauren Beitelspacher, professor of marketing at Babson College, said in emailed comments. Yet, “retail is always fraught with disruption,” Beitelspacher said. “The ups and downs are normal.” The big unknown for specialty retailers and big-box stores alike this year has been consumer sentiment. Tariffs, inflation, layoffs and a sudden suspension of SNAP funding have all contributed to an unsteady foundation for many holiday shoppers. Stores weren’t exactly sure how to gauge inventory for the season. Over half of holiday orders were placed by the end of May, about two months earlier when compared to 2024, according to Deloitte’s 2025 Retail Holiday Buyer Survey. Retail buyers paused shipments of some orders due to the trade environment or even canceled orders they determined would be unprofitable. The National Tree Company saw retailers “fall back somewhat because they were unsure of the consumer demand and consumer sentiment for this holiday season,” Butler said. Holiday shortages loomed over this Christmas season even as early as July, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. A 90-day reprieve in tariffs during the summer didn’t solve problems, according to the nonprofit group, because most Christmas decor items, including trees, lights, ornaments and garlands, are manufactured overseas with long production lead times. Now that retailers are in the throes of the season, some shoppers are pulling back on purchasing those exact items. Nearly 30% of people in the U.S. are decreasing their decorating budgets this year, according to a survey from Rocket Mortgage and Redfin. More than half (56%) of the segment that is pulling back say it is because they are trying to save money, while 44% named economic uncertainty as the reason behind the change. But there are still deals out there to be had. “If you’re in the market for a tree, buy now, buy early, buy multiple,” Butler said. “Despite the price increase from the tariffs, there are absolutely going to be deals. Because us — as well as everybody else — is seeing softness in demand. So there’s definitely going to be deals.” Butler also leads the Christmas Trade Group, a 10-member organization that collectively brings in over $1 billion annually and represents over 1,000 employees. He recently was in Washington, D.C., meeting with the Senate Finance Committee as a way to provide education on their businesses and garner insights into tariffs going forward. “2025 is done,” Butler said. “So what we’re trying to do is ‘save Christmas’ for 2026. Both from a supply chain perspective, in terms of securing supply in the right areas, as well as from a cost perspective, to keep the costs lower.” “We want to maintain the affordability of the holiday,” he said.

Title: Amazon CTO Werner Vogels just released his 2026 tech predictions. He’s most optimistic about ‘personalized learning’ and ‘renaissance developers’

Good morning. Several years ago, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels began sharing predictions on how technology would likely impact our lives the following year. In the past, he has foreseen the impact of digital technology in sports, AI assistants in developer productivity, machine learning embedded in production lines, and ‘fem tech’ in women’s health. As CTO since 2005, he occupies a unique perch to see—and even shape—what’s next. He also has a vested interest, of course, in embracing the technologies that his company creates. But these predictions are worth taking note of as these trends—if they materialize—will affect wide swaths of the economy. So what’s he forecasting for 2026? I spoke with Vogels about the thinking behind this year’s predictions. Among other things, he admits that technology tools from AI to military drones can obviously harm or help, depending on the intention of the user. But he’s an optimist, especially about the potential for personalized learning and software developers. And how does he see the mission of the CTO—a role that can cover everything from being the person who manages data centers to the founder focused on product? “I actually think CTOs are horrible managers. You should never put a CTO in charge of people,” he argues. “VPs of engineering wake up in the morning, thinking ‘Do I have the best team in the best situation? Can I shield them from politics and stuff like that?’ The CTO thinks about, ‘What’s the next technology that we should be building?’ Actually, that was my role for many years within Amazon. Then you become a technology provider, and then your role changes again. You have to understand how your customers are actually using your technology.” As for what excites him most: “Especially in Africa, I’ve met so many motivated engineers that don’t want to come to the U.S. They don’t want to go work for a large company. They want to solve the problem in their country. I love that. That’s where the real progress lies.” Click here for our full interview.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Google challenges Nvidia’s chips Shares of Nvidia dropped following a report that Meta is in talks to buy billions worth of AI chips from Google, suggesting the search engine company’s chips are ready to compete with Nvidia’s bestselling versions.

Tim Cook’s possible successors Since Apple CEO Tim Cook turned 65 recently , speculation has intensified about his possible successors. John Ternus, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue and Greg ‘Joz’ Joswiak are all reportedly in the running and oversee different parts of the company. The Big Short investor compares Nvidia with Cisco The Big Short investor Michael Burry wrote in his first Substack post that Nvidia is the equivalent of Cisco during the dot com bubble: significantly overvalued and a harbinger for when the AI bubble will pop. Novo Nordisk’s slump continues U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk fell more than 5% on Monday, largely due to the drug developer’s announcement that semaglutide, the core ingredient in its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, did not slow cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s patients. The company has lost almost half of its value since the year started. Is robot-driven unemployment already here? Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October, and multiple sources now predict another round of layoffs in early 2026 as the company doubles down on AI and robotics. Both blue-collar and white-collar employees are growing anxious about who might be next—and what the future looks like if there aren’t enough jobs left for humans.

Title: India shouldn’t build AI models: The prize lies in using what exists to innovate and generate value

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it was eliminating 14,000 management positions because artificial intelligence (AI) tools had rendered those middle-management roles redundant. Amazon isn’t the only one—Microsoft, Google and IBM have all announced AI-related layoffs. According to a 2023 report by Niti Aayog, 1.5 million Indian jobs in the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors alone are expected to be at high risk by 2031. McKinsey believes that as many as 69% of tasks in India’s IT services industry can already be automated with existing AI technology, suggesting that as many as 3-4 million jobs in the IT and BPO sectors could be at risk in the near to medium term. Our instinctive response has been to try to catch up—to build AI capabilities so that we can replace the jobs being lost by upskilling displaced workers with the technology that displaced them. We have announced AI education initiatives, established new AI research centres and funded GPU clusters and data centres that we believe these newly trained engineers will be able to use for building AI applications. But this strategy is unlikely to be effective. Firstly, India will not be able to bridge the skills gap by simply retraining its existing workforce. Unlike the IT industry, which has a broad base, AI has an inverted pyramid and is staffed in exactly the opposite way that a BPO centre is staffed. As a result, even if we manage to reskill all those in the traditional IT industry, only a small fraction of those reskilled IT workers will be needed going forward. What’s more, unlike the US, which boasts of 30 years of AI research infrastructure and top universities that attract global talent, and China, which is investing billions in AI research and already has a massive pool of strong STEM graduates, India currently produces fewer than 500 AI PhDs annually. Even if we increase this 10-fold, we will still be playing catch-up in a field where first-mover advantages matter enormously. The trouble with competing in the race to build better AI models is that it requires us to compete upstream in the AI value chain in a market already crowded by players with significantly more capital and hardware infrastructure, which places them ahead in the game. As noble as it might seem for us to fight the good fight, there are other areas in which Indian investments in time and resources are likely to yield better results. When the automobile disrupted traditional urban mobility and transport dynamics, the real opportunity was not in making cars, but in the novel ways in which they could be used for business and the new liberties that arose from being able to use these machines for things that were not possible earlier. When Apple invented the smartphone, it did not just create a revolutionary communication device, but also made it possible for brand new businesses (such as ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments) to emerge. Every technological transformation creates ripples of opportunity downstream that offer new avenues for entrepreneurship. This suggests that the AI opportunity lies not in competing with big AI labs to build better models, but rather in discovering all the various ways in which AI can be deployed to create value. This, in turn, suggests that instead of competing with countries that are at the cutting edge of developing new foundational AI models, India may be far better off figuring out how to use AI to do things that would not have been possible previously. One of the clearest signs of this downstream potential is how dramatically AI has already lowered barriers to creative endeavours. Already, to write a story or create an image, a musical composition or a software feature, all you need to do is describe what you want and AI will execute it. Even just a few years ago, filmmaking required large crews, expensive equipment and a budget that ran into millions. AI has made it possible to create visual effects, voice actors and music scores, with film editing done and other technical skills deployed at a fraction of that cost. Similarly, music production used to require studio recording, mixing and mastering skills. Today, with AI, almost anyone can generate a score, create vocal effects and mix tracks. Just as the world saw in the case of every other technological transformation that created new jobs and industries downstream of the actual disruption it caused, AI too will birth business opportunities that are not even conceivable today. If we really want to address the disruptions that AI will cause in the job market, we should focus our energies on enabling as many of our people as possible to figure out how to use AI and do all we can to make it possible for our young entrepreneurs to leverage this new technology in as many new and interesting ways as they can imagine. The next three to five years will be a period of intense experimentation, when AI-assisted business models will be tested, refined and scaled. India’s entrepreneurs have a rare early-mover advantage—not in building the models themselves, but in discovering what those models make possible. If we invest our energy downstream, in imagining the new possibilities that are opening up, we will be able to harness the real opportunity that AI offers. Our best response to the AI revolution is not to build better intelligence, but discover the many ways in which it can be put to use. India needs to make the most of this opportunity.

Title: Nvidia CEO told employees to use AI for 'every task that is possible' and says there will still be plenty of jobs

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?" Huang said he strongly disapproved. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do." Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday. Have a tip?

Title: Gen Z Redefines Work as Flexible Pay Gains Ground

With inflation and changing government policies prompting widespread uncertainty, 6 in 10 American workers are facing pocketbook challenges while lacking the steadiness and predictability of a salaried job.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ The latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series, breaks down how consumers earn income. The study is based on a census-balanced survey of 2,117 U.S. adult consumers, 62% are employed. Among those workers, 43% say their primary source of income is an hourly wage, and another 15% say it is from other non-salaried pay models such as gig work or contract fees. Gen Z workers especially are working outside of fixed-salary roles. Nearly 3 in 4 get their income in other ways, with 51% earning hourly wages, 9% earning contract or consulting fees, 7% earning income from gig or platform work and 5% earning commission-based pay. More Americans are relying on part-time jobs to make ends meet. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employees working full-time dropped by 0.5%, or 695,000 people, between 2023 and 2024. The number of part-time workers jumped 3.7%, or just over 1 million people, during the same period. Relatedly, the rise in gig work can be seen in the expansion of major platforms catering to independent contractors and freelancers. In the third quarter of 2025, Uber said it had 9.4 million drivers, up from 7.8 million the year before and 7.4 million in the second quarter of last year. DoorDash grew total orders by 21% year over year in Q3 to 776 million. Lyft reported record-high gross bookings of $4.8 billion in the third quarter, a 16% year-on-year spike. Even companies outside the dedicated gig platform space, such as UPS, are using the gig model. But as more consumers rely on hourly, project-based and gig work to make ends meet, rather than the stability of a fixed salary, they may find it harder to weather an uncertain economic environment. Because of the Trump administration’s global “reciprocal” tariffs regime, Americans face the highest import levies in 90 years. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Recent PYMNTS data shows confidence slipping, especially among lower-income workers. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, often described as a pessimist, sees the threat of a U.S. recession continuing to loom as the new year approaches. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including 42% who see their money fly out the door the month it comes in, an 18% jump since August. It is not as if these workers can simply leave their jobs for more steady, reliable work, with the number of job openings unchanged at 7.2 million in August. What’s more, many of the skilled jobs that often come with fixed salaries are shrinking. While economists are sharply divided over the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs, some recent research suggests that white collar roles — those traditional salaried positions — will be most impacted. While some businesses tout how AI will enable them to introduce operational efficiencies and reduce their workforces, companies also downsize for reasons not related to the technology. October saw a 175% year-over-year increase in layoffs, with Amazon planning to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs and Target slashing its corporate roles by 1,800. Workers have been nervous about these reductions for some time. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey last year found that 58% of consumers believed generative AI posed a risk to high-skilled jobs in tech. More than half deemed it a risk to mainstream office-based occupations, and 52% said it jeopardized roles for qualified education workers. As go changes in the labor market, so go spending and consumption patterns, deepening the connection between income instability and personal financial well-being.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Pragmatism, not idealism, will determine the fate of Google’s ad tech empire

More from the series → After months of testimony and a final day of unusually pointed questioning, Judge Leonie Brinkema used the closing arguments phase of the U.S. Department of Justice v. Google to give the clearest indication yet of how she is weighing up an appropriate remedy after ruling the defendant a monopolist earlier this year. After Friday’s proceedings, she has now retired to her chambers to mull over a decision over the coming weeks, but for many, a complete divestiture of Google’s ad exchange or ad server (i.e., the entity formerly known as DoubleClick For Publishers within Google Ad Manager) appears increasingly unlikely. During closing arguments, the judge repeatedly steered the discussion away from theory and toward hard practicalities, indicating that pragmatism, more than pure ideals, will (likely) drive the final outcome. This is because Brinkema’s questions consistently pressed the DOJ on implementation timelines, commercial feasibility, and the (what many courtroom attendees perceived as) a lack of concrete detail in its structural remedy plan. “Time is of the essence,” she said at one point, citing the rapid pace of technological change in advertising and AI. Any remedy, she stressed, must be “concrete” and must account for the “commercial reality” of execution. That framing dominated the morning. While DOJ attorney Matthew Huppert reiterated the government’s preference for a structural remedy — divesting AdX, open-sourcing auction logic, or potentially forcing a sale of GAM — he conceded DOJ was “not dogmatic about the details.” But when pressed on specifics, including whether a structural remedy could be implemented during an inevitable appeal, the DOJ offered little. Judge Brinkema, noted that behavioral remedies “could go forward whether there is an appeal pending or not,.” She added, “[Divestiture] is a dramatic change,… [it] would most likely not be as easily enforceable while an appeal was pending.” Google’s Karen Dunn capitalized on that hesitation. Dunn argued the DOJ “did not meet the heavy burden required for a divestiture,” arguing that witnesses for the defense asserted that Google’s proposed remedies would address their concerns. She further outlined Google’s opinion that the DOJ failed to prove behavioral remedies were insufficient; that a technically and commercially workable buyer existed; and that divestiture would restore competition or avoid harms to consumers. During rebuttal, DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood conceded that a buyer has not been identified –although Digiday sources have relayed how loose-lipped attendees at this year’s Advertising Week New York voiced their intentions to take a look at the DFP – while the defendant argued a sale would be “messy, risky and long, with no guarantee of success.” What the ruling will likely look like Taken together, Brinkema’s questions point to a strong likelihood that she will opt against ordering a divestiture — at least not immediately. Her emphasis on timelines, enforceability during appeal, technical feasibility and the need to avoid abstract reasoning suggests she is leaning toward a behavioral-first remedy, potentially supplemented with guardrails or phased requirements. A ruling is expected “likely next year,” she said — most likely in Q1 or Q2 of 2026, based on her remarks. Settlement? Appeal? Hw long will this drag on? Brinkema remarked that she “could see a settlement” that makes sense, though she acknowledged the widening gap between the parties and the existence of “looming settlements” in other ad-tech cases. Realistically, the chance of an agreed resolution appears low. An appeal, however, appears inevitable. Google has signaled as much, and Brinkema repeatedly referenced the complications of crafting remedies that must survive scrutiny. A full appellate cycle could take 18–30 months, pushing any structural remedy (if ordered) well into 2028. In other words, the case may be nearing its first final judgment, but the industry is only entering the next chapter. “We’re entering an odd moment in AI where a huge number of “AI companies” are basically wrappers on top of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or open models like Mistral and Qwen. They don’t own the tech, the data, or the infrastructure — yet they’re being valued as if they do.” – One Digiday source casts a healthy dose of cynicism among the AI hype-cycle Sources suggest Amazon’s latest round of mass layoffs cut headcount in its advertising division by up to 20%, though staff there are paid through the last week of January, making it difficult to establish exact numbers. A new pitch deck making the rounds at agencies drives that point home. Google boss Sunar Pichai warns ‘no company immune’ to AI bubble bursts The most powerful chief executive in the industry says the quiet part out loud. The EU considers cracking down on Big Tech’s cloud power Cloud infrastructure is increasingly part of the consideration of advertisers and their supply chain, and that’s not lost on regulators. Advertisers see now value in news, but Google knows society will pay Richard Gingras, Google’s longtime news policy lead, he continues to push back on the Google-owned web argument, in conversation with Ricky Sutton and Alan Chapell. Yahoo is testing 6 AI agents for advertising, leaked slides show Yahoo hopes to capitalize weariness over Google’s market leadership and the escalating standoff between Amazon and The Trade Desk to further its marketshare of its demand-side platform. The world’s largest agency holding company is born. But there may come a day soon where it can no longer be called an agency, but rather a broker and re-seller. Agencies, ad-tech companies and publishers are racing to test AI media agents. Not all those tests are successful — even some that are. The e-commerce giant has quietly blocked more OpenAI-related bots from crawling Amazon.com, according to updates in its publicly visible robots.txt file.

Title: Apple eliminates dozens of jobs across its sales organization

Update font size. Reset Apple is cutting dozens of enterprise sales positions as part of a restructuring aimed at simplifying how it sells to businesses, schools, and government clients. The eliminated roles include account managers and staff who ran Apple’s dedicated briefing centers used for institutional meetings and product demos. A company spokesperson confirmed the changes, saying the move will allow Apple to reach more customers, and that impacted employees are eligible to apply for other open positions inside the company. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ Apple confirmed on Monday that it’s reshuffling the division, without giving specifics. “To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles,” a spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. “We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.” It’s unusual for Apple to make cuts across an organization, and the layoffs came as a surprise to those affected. The move is especially notable because revenue has been growing at the fastest clip in years. Apple is on track to generate sales of nearly $140 billion in the December quarter, smashing its previous record. Employees who lost their jobs have until Jan. 20 to secure another position within the company or they’ll be terminated with a severance package. Apple is advertising sales roles on its jobs website and told laid-off workers they could apply for them. Internally, the company is positioning the layoffs as part of an effort to streamline its sales workforce and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. But some of the affected workers said the move was driven by an effort to shift more sales to third-party resellers, which the company refers to as the channel. Some organizations prefer to work with those indirect sellers, they said, and the change helps Apple lower internal costs like salaries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: When a company decides a different go-to-market model will be more efficient or scalable, certain positions can become superfluous. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Epic CEO: "RAM price increases will be a real problem" — as OpenAI et al. blow up RAM prices, threatening affordability of everything from Xbox to TVs and laptops

The AI fad is destroying the affordability of RAM, as demand from OpenAI, Google, and others blow up prices. Why is this happening? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Gamers can't seem to catch a break, although this latest goldrush is going to impact far more than just gamers this time around. After years of dealing with the crypto craze blowing up GPU prices, the artificial intelligence fad being pushed by companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others, is now having a serious impact on the affordability and scarcity of RAM. For those who don't know, RAM (random access memory) is used as temporary memory storage used to store and access data on a short-term basis. Simplified, you can think of it as your computer's short-term memory, and is designed for on-demand rapidity so apps and games can run instantly. You can find it in basically any "smart" device, from TVs to phones to laptops, to Xbox consoles and gaming PCs. In just a few weeks, the general price of consumer-grade DDR5 RAM has increased in some cases by as much as 110%, with products like Micron's Crucial Pro 32GB DDR5 kit effectively doubling in price in the space of a month. And things might only get worse. Speaking on X, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney described the scale of the problem, as government-backed companies like OpenAI outbid consumer manufacturers on RAM fabrication priorities. RAM price increases will be a real problem for high-end gaming for several years. Factories are diverting leading edge DRAM capacity to meet AI needs where data centers are bidding far higher than consumer device makers. https://t.co/VgO2OG4oOrNovember 24, 2025 Indeed, companies like OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others are striking massive deals with RAM manufacturers such as Samsung and SK Hynix to supply their data centers. Artificial intelligence is the tech fad du jour, with governments and shareholders seemingly convinced that the technology is critical for national security (and also lowering firm's costs by offloading tasks to clankers robots instead of humans). True or not, it's the main driving force behind these price increases. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. OpenAI and others are being given massive loans and subsidies (often paid for by taxpayers) and require absolutely enormous quantities of electricity, processing, and also memory capacity. Backed by nation states and the full force of Wall Street hype, manufacturers of consumer-grade goods like laptops, video game consoles, and TVs typically already endure thin margins — they cannot outbid the likes of OpenAI on data center component purchasing. Some manufacturers have stockpiled RAM specifically to avoid price increases on their products in the interim to try and weather the storm. There were some rumors that Xbox Series X|S consoles, which have recently endured price increases, would be rapidly exposed to further increases as a result of this. Sources tell me that Microsoft does have a healthy supply of Xbox, Surface, and other RAM-using stock for the time being. But of course, those stocks will not last forever — for any manufacturer. Indeed, the current wave of AI hype doesn't seem likely it will die down any time soon. Once any existing consumer tech supplies dwindle for any manufacturer, products like Xbox and PlayStation consoles, television sets, laptops, and more, could start to see serious price increases over time. The volatility between AI demand and tariffs is why we didn't get the Xbox Ally prices until the very last minute, and why we still don't have the Steam Machine prices either. Things are just generally crazy right now, to use industry terms. The first to feel the pinch will be anyone who is buying RAM standalone to upgrade their PCs or existing laptops. The world only has so much capacity to produce RAM, meaning demand will likely exceed supply for the foreseeable. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron control some 90% of the market together. Consumer tech manufacturers will bid for chips from these companies directly for their own products. And given the out-sized purchasing power from companies like OpenAI, flooded with investor cash, us peasants will have to endure the scraps for the time being. It's just another thing for the pile of reasons to hate this big AI fad — destroyed livelihoods, greenhouse gasses, electricity prices, layoffs, stolen water supplies, toxic chemicals, turbo-charged false information industry, mental health degradation, and now rapidly ballooning consumer goods prices.

Title: A few hundred employees working on "self-directed projects" has made Valve one of the world's most profitable-per-person companies, on track to top $17 billion this year and shame the likes of Google and Meta

You get a yacht, and you get a yacht When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Analyst estimates of Valve's annual revenue is already around 6% higher than the whole of 2024, meaning it is on track to surpass $17 billion by the end of the year. While this number is already staggering, it is even more impressive in context of how many people the company employs, with likely less than 400 staff members working at the gaming giant. Steam's owner Valve is one of the few independent gaming companies of its size, and this means that despite how much money it makes, it's able to hold its cards close to its chest. This is where analysts help us out, with Alinea Analytics estimating that the company has already earned more than $16.3 billion in the first 11 months of this year. Steam has generated $16B+ in revenue so far this year (@alineaanalytics estimates)That's already up 5.7% from 2024's final total!Taking Valve's cuts into account (and 100% cuts of its own juggernauts CS2 and Dota 2), Valve itself has made over $4B+ this year from Steam. pic.twitter.com/PlMCjDEEgDNovember 13, 2025 Despite Valve's momentous revenue, it only has a few hundred employees. The last time employee information was made public was in 2024, when court documents from 2021 that weren't properly redacted were discovered. As reported by The Verge, the company claimed to have just 336 employees on the payroll, but has likely expanded due to the launch of the Steam Deck. Working with estimates, Valve likely earns $40 - 50 million per employee, blowing companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft out of the water. The Xbox parent company makes the most of the three (I'm sure in no small part due to its history of mass layoffs), but it isn't even close to big daddy Valve at just $18 million per staff member. Valve has been aware that it's on to a winning formula since at least 2012 when it wrote some industry-standard-breaking statements in its still available employee handbook. Not only does the book inform employees that "100%" of their work will be "self-directed projects", but that their pay will be directly correlated with what they produce. "Valve pays people very well compared to industry norms," the book states. "Our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft, and we believe strongly that the right thing to do in that case is to put a maximum amount of money back into each employee’s pocket. Valve does not win if you’re paid less than the value you create. And people who work here ultimately don’t win if they get paid more than the value they create." While this last statement looks like a way of paying Valve staff less than desireably, the above mentioned court documents showed that the average Valve employee earned $1.3 million per year back in 2021. Might not be the $50 million that Valve is raking in per person, but Gabe Newell needs to buy his yachts somehow, eh? Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Steam Machine price "more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," confirms Valve – but "ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal."

Title: Jeff Bezos' Grim US Economy Prediction Is Coming True

It's hard to turn around without encountering a grim financial prediction these days, and many well-known figures in the finance sphere have had something to say about it. Between the budgetary impact tariffs have on families, the rising cost of groceries, and a higher cost of living for most Americans, even some of the wealthiest people in the country are feeling uneasy. While the economy may not ever be grinding too hard on Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, that doesn't change the fact that he made a grim economic prediction that is now coming true. In a 2023 interview with CNN, Bezos warned, "The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy." While this observation may not have predicted the sweeping job losses due to 2025's DOGE job and budget cuts, the labor market has hit a brick wall. Per analysis by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, hiring frequency is the lowest it's been in 14 years. The company's November 2025 reporting stated the United States had cut more than 1 million jobs by October 2025, the highest layoff total since the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in 2020. However, Bezos' fortune-telling didn't stop there. Bezos warned consumers and small business owners to "play the probabilities" by cutting big spending. He suggested it might be preferable to have some cash reserves, rather than new gear or appliances, if things get even worse — advice that still rings darkly true in 2025. Bezos did not predict economic recession, but his interview confirms the complex nature of what was to come. Even so, in his CNN interview, he clearly pushed risk aversion across the board, saying, "Try to reduce some risk in your business or your life." Bezos floats near the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and despite being one of the richest men in the world, the advice he gave feels applicable to people in many economic classes. For business owners, Bezos warned, "Maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it could wait a little bit," before going on to say that even small precautions like that delay could be what keeps a business afloat amid economic turmoil. Investors in the market have seen wild volatility in 2025, making Bezos' words seem relevant to pretty much all financial sectors. However, the market bursts as much as it sags, and both small and large investments could have significant weight on many individuals' financial situations. Bezos's suggestion that small business owners avoid risky business also goes against much of what he's done to build his own empire. Bezos is obsessed with taking risks, and he's preoccupied with absorbing competition. In fact, part of why Amazon is so massive is the amount of investment the company made in taking over so many competitors in its path. Americans spend a ton on Amazon every month, so listening to Bezos' business advice might make sense. However, he founded Amazon out of a garage, as a bookselling operation. He's now backing an AI company to program proteins. That doesn't happen without risk. Bezos has been accused of underpaying workers, sneakily underpaying himself, and doing everything to avoid taxes. It takes more than greed and avarice to succeed, but a close look at Bezos's early history shows a degree of strategy beyond using brutish amounts of cash to buy up everything around him. "Take as much risk off the table as you can for yourself," Bezos insisted at the end of his CNN interview. Frugality and austerity may work for surviving the toughest of economic times, but no one knows an individual business better than the owner. Penny pinching too heavily can be the reason a small business fails, rather than thrives. Not purchasing a desperately needed new appliance like a fridge could mean a lot of food and energy goes to waste, and money would go along with it. Everyone must try to best weigh their own economic decisions with their own reality. For some, it might work out to follow some of Bezos' actions rather than his words. After all, if you invested in Amazon 20 years ago, you would be very wealthy now.

Title: Big pay, bigger influence: How Wall Street's war for AI talent is shaping new power dynamics

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The hottest job on Wall Street right now isn't a trader or dealmaker. It belongs to the human minds who specialize in building the digital ones. Bank chiefs have been touting how adopting artificial intelligence at scale will help employees work smarter and cut costs, and they're putting serious money behind those AI ambitions. Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon said in October that he wished the firm's $6 billion annual tech budget was even higher, while Bank of America dedicated $4 billion this year to "new technology initiatives," according to the company. A chunk of that investment is directed at building out battalions of tech professionals to realize those strategies. However, the demand for that talent is driving salaries for technologists who specialize in AI — from rank-and-file engineers to executive and C-suite tech strategists — to soar at banks, according to insiders. "There's certainly not enough people" to keep pace with hiring demand, said recruiter Ryan Bulkoski, the global head of the AI, data, and analytics practice at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles. Recruiters and executives across financial services companies told Business Insider the result is a full-blown talent war pitting Wall Street banks against hedge funds, private asset managers, and Silicon Valley startups. The senior-level or C-suite AI leader who can steer corporate strategy "is the hottest job in the market" right now, forcing financial services firms to cough up "stretch offers," Chris Connors, a principal at the compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, told Business Insider. "If you are a high-caliber talent, you are more desirable than virtually every other role in the market," Connors added, noting that some firms have extended special, non-standard awards to lure top-tier talent or prevent them from leaving. Competition across the industry is fierce, as hedge funds and other asset managers have even issued incremental equity or long-term awards, Connors said — they often range from $500,000 to $1 million, typically vesting across three to four years. Some firms have offered "significant upfront sign-on grants," often in excess of $200,000, delivered off the bat as cash or equity, he said. For banks, especially, it has created a conundrum — how to extend big-ticket offers while adhering to their often rigid, standardized compensation bands. Hiring managers are forking over "some uncomfortable hiring packages" which are vaulting recipients into "a completely different stratosphere," Bulkoski explained, noting that top compensation packages for senior-level AI leaders are reaching the high seven- and even eight-figure range. "Nobody's leaving for less than 30%" pay increases if they're coming from companies where they're already "heads-down and doing well," he said. "No one's going to move for the historical 10, 15, or even 20% bump in compensation." AI hiring in the financial services industry grew in 2025 to 10 times its level at the start of January 2022, according to an analysis by workforce data provider Revelio Labs. To assemble the data, Revelio examined finance job postings for roles like "AI engineer," "machine learning engineer," and "computer vision engineer," among others. Six of the largest US banks — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley — have collectively posted more than 2,000 AI roles in the past 12 months, Revelio's data showed. That surging demand for AI talent is driving paychecks higher. The average salary for AI professionals in finance, excluding C-suite roles, had risen to about $180,000 from $142,000 in 2020. That increase of more than 25% puts them on par with what conventional tech firms tend to pay for these roles, Revelio said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment. "What we have seen with banks over the past few years is they've had to really reframe and reimagine those comp ranges, especially for a lot of this type of talent," Ben Hodzic, head of North America at the recruiting firm Selby Jennings, told Business Insider. That's especially true as they're coming up against multistrategy hedge funds and high-frequency systematic trading firms that are "paying whatever they need to pay to get people," he said. But money alone isn't enough, insiders said. These technologists also want something else: power. Insiders said the AI race has elevated the voices of technology chiefs at banks and asset managers, giving them a perch at powerful tables that steer firms' overall strategy. Bulkoski said that, for prospective AI chiefs, wielding greater levels of influence in the boardroom alongside other C-suite leaders is an appealing prospect unto itself. "It could trump another number on the sheet," he said. The nature of the work is attracting a broad swathe of professionals eager to exploit the breach. "Go on LinkedIn and look at the number of people who just changed their title from data scientist to AI scientist," Bulkoski said. "It's kind of unbelievable." Candidates for senior-level roles are skewing younger, he continued. Some AI-savvy talent in their early- to mid-20s are pulling high-six to seven-figure offers, he said. To suss out who is a fit and who isn't, Bulkoski said his team assesses "whether they have a real track record" of constructing original AI or machine learning products at scale, and if they can channel that knowledge into creating commercial or operational value. "Most are in the early phases of developing executive maturity," he said, "but the best of them can already influence senior leaders by grounding every conversation in architecture, data, and measurable impact." With access to the board and stepped-up influence and responsibility, some Wall Street insiders are betting they can offer something Big Tech companies generally can't: a steadier, more clearly defined climb up the professional ranks. With tech firms consolidating and fears of an AI bubble mounting, recruiters say some technologists are increasingly drawn to the stability and hierarchy that the financial services industry is known for. "There's been a lot less volatility with jobs in the finance industry compared to the tech industry," said Selby Jennings' Hodzic, adding that finance offers a more well-worn, clearly defined pathway. He said Wall Street had been insulated from the kind of mass layoffs that have roiled Big Tech. Amazon, for instance, cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025. Recruiters say the flames fanning the talent war aren't dissipating anytime soon, and that the next phase of the hiring race is already underway. "In 2025, it's almost like Gen AI is in the past," Bulkoski said. "We're actually now working on searches that have 'agentic AI' in the title." Jump to

Title: 'Entitled,' 'complacent,' and 'sloppy': Inside the workplace tension at the world's largest HR organization

On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. The brief performance, which took place in a conference room with about 75 employees, came after remarks honoring the 24th anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. SHRM has been embroiled in controversy in recent years. Some of these challenges have gripped workplaces across the country, including regular layoffs and restructurings and debates over DEI. Other elements, however, set SHRM apart. They include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a "conservative" dress code that referenced "enclothed cognition" and bans sequins; an employment discrimination lawsuit set to go to trial in December; and a company-wide meeting in which CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr. said some staffers were "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Revenue grew from $131 million in 2017 to $233 million last year, according to public tax filings. It has 413 employees today, up from 387 in December 2017. This article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former SHRM employees and nearly a dozen current and former members, as well as legal and tax filings and government records. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. SHRM was founded in 1948 and today describes itself as "the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces." Former staffers characterized it as a punitive workplace. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. A memo sent to SHRM's brand and marketing staff in January laid out a dress code that included a lengthy introduction about "enclothed cognition," a term that refers to the notion that the clothing workers wear impacts their performance. The code required staff to dress in "conservative" business attire and prohibited items such as sneakers, denim, skorts, sequins, hats, and clothing that doesn't cover the area between the shoulders and knees. Burke said "SHRM offers employees the flexibility to arrive between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." and noted that the workplace is remote Mondays and Fridays. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "Literally, I've not told anyone, because I've been trying to figure out where I was going to land, and I've landed on a decision," Taylor said. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. There will be a total reorg … And this is not a decision that I've made again with anyone, no one." His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. SHRM cut staff earlier this month. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." In his statement, Taylor said November's "organizational redesign is about shifting for the future, not reacting to the past," adding that the cuts were not due to financial strain and that the organization has an "enviable balance sheet." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. In some cases, full teams were let go. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." "That's on us — and we've corrected it. We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. Repeated layoffs can be a sign of poor leadership, said Herd, the former head of HR for North America at McKinsey. SHRM is "literally describing themselves as experts in all things work and selling best practices in talent planning. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. It rings hollow to put the blame ostensibly on the people you chose to hire." "Whether they like it or not, they are held to a higher standard because they've put themselves out there as the preeminent expert on work." "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Daniel Burchfield, who joined SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation in 2024, said performance issues were cited in his February termination. But he said he hadn't been reprimanded or put on a performance improvement plan. "Nothing negative was indicated to me," he said. Two weeks before his termination, Burchfield said he told his manager he was worried about layoffs. He said the manager replied that SHRM likes to maintain an atmosphere of fear to drive performance. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." SHRM itself has said as much. "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. "They do the opposite of what they preach." Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. Last year, a judge called the case "messy" and said the evidence showed that the same HR person tasked with investigating Mohamed's complaints was also ghostwriting emails for Mohamed's boss and drafting Mohamed's termination paperwork around the same time. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. We know the facts, and we trust the process." Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. Workplace-discrimination lawsuits rarely get this far, he said. Further, SHRM didn't bring an independent investigator to oversee its internal probe into the matter, the court found. This is "far from best practices," Fray-Witzer said. In response to questions from Mohamed's lawyers, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, SHRM made DEI a focus of its educational materials. In 2021, a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by SHRM concluded that company leaders should make DEI a strategic priority. It said that DEI is not only "the right thing to do," but research shows DEI leaders outperform their competitors financially. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. SHRM spent $1 million to $2 million annually on lobbying in recent years, US Senate filings show. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the American Heart Association was "a valued member" and said SHRM looks "forward to continuing to explore ways of working with them in the future." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. Starbuck has repeatedly called DEI "poison." At the event, he said he believes "equity" is a "Marxist concept." "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "They claim this is a free exchange of ideas and they're just trying to bring different opinions," she said. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Not all SHRM members opposed Starbuck's participation. Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. He said he believed HR leaders need to understand the full corporate landscape, even when it might be uncomfortable. In a statement to Business Insider, Starbuck said he spent two hours taking photos with conference attendees after he finished speaking. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. Membership revenue increased in 2024, from $69 million to $75.6 million, according to its tax filings. Figures for 2025 aren't yet available. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor's total compensation has also grown. He received $4 million last year, more than five times what he made in 2018 and a 48% increase from what he was paid in 2022. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. The fund said Smith had been insubordinate. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. The student wrote that his acceptance was rescinded because of his hairstyle and called the policy "discriminatory, sexist, and contrary to TMCF's mission of supporting" students from historically Black colleges and universities. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times. Kinsey said the group's treatment of its workers shows "hypocrisy," while Schmidt compared his work at SHRM to "the marketing department for the Death Star." "I highly encourage you to never give a dollar to this organization," Schmidt said in one video. It was filmed in SHRM's offices. Have a tip? Know more? Reach Sarah E.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Devang Sharma, a 27-year-old senior software engineer at Meta, based in Menlo Park, CA. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The first time I joined Meta was in 2022. I uprooted my life in London and moved to Toronto to work there. I stayed for around four and a half months before being laid off. Meta is an amazing organization, one I saw myself retiring at, but there was nothing I could do to keep my job. Three years later, a recruiter from Meta reached out to me, and I had the chance to rejoin the company in a much more senior role. I had offers from other AI companies, but returning to Meta felt like a homecoming. With the direction of the industry, there's always a chance of layoffs; however, I saw coming back as a trade-off. I was working at a startup as an engineer before I applied for the Meta software engineering position in Toronto. When I was impacted by company layoffs, it was really challenging to deal with, especially as an immigrant. It was the middle of winter, and I had just left everything I knew behind in London. But I was still grateful for the first experience I had working at such a large scale. I was not dependent on Meta for my immigration status because I got my permanent residency, so I was free to switch jobs. Within a month, I secured several offers and landed a new role. There are LinkedIn groups, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and email newsletters for former Meta employees. I was always in touch with the former and current employees I worked with, as well as those I had not worked with directly. The conversations were mostly regarding what's happening across the industry and also within Meta. With the recent movements and investments in AI, a lot has changed over the past two and a half to three years. Meta has an internal system that tracks and enables them to reach out to current and former employees. A Meta recruiter emailed me about a specific role and team, and when I got more details about the position, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for. The interviews were similar to my first time interviewing with them in terms of coding standards and system design, but more complex in terms of tangible design problems. I was in the interview process with other organizations and considering their offers. This made me sort of unsure whether to proceed with Meta. Before rejoining Meta, I was working at Amazon. Although I had the opportunity to work with some great AI models, I was not directly contributing to the foundational models or writing the models myself. My role was primarily focused on implementing and fine-tuning. When I discovered that I could contribute to the domain of artificial intelligence firsthand by building and writing models, not just on the implementation side, which perfectly aligned with what I was looking for, I was thrilled. I'm in my 20s and I don't have a family. I'm pretty flexible in terms of my responsibilities. I couldn't sit back and be fearful about what would happen if there were more layoffs. There will probably be some, but I can't control it. I would've regretted not taking a chance to work on something amazing, simply because I chose a safe route. I had such a mixture of emotions going into my new hire orientation, this time at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park. It brought back all the memories of my first time joining the company back in Toronto. I knew that employees who worked at headquarters got to meet people like Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Meta, and other C-suite executives. Back in 2022, at the Toronto office, we were just watching them on video. In 2025, I was sitting in the front row while Chris Cox gave an amazing speech. Things have changed since I last worked here. Priorities differ, and the company is leaner, so things move more quickly. The company's evolution in terms of shipping features is happening at a very fast pace; it's no longer a traditional software engineering role. It's more about how integrated we are with AI. Whenever you're returning to a previous organization that you have worked with, it feels like a homecoming because there's naturally some attachment there. My piece of advice would be to try to come in with the mindset of a newbie. I'm using my previous experience to help me, but I'm also thinking of this new experience as if I were joining Meta for the first time. This approach has helped me overcome my prejudices. It's given me a chance to be a curious learner, and that's one of the most important things that you can do as a professional. Do you have a story to share about being a boomerang employee?

Amazon Inc has done the largest workforce reduction in its history, which hit the engineering roles the most. Four in 10 employees were engineers in the latest 14,000 job cuts, WARN data showed. The company announced the layoffs on October, 2025. The move impacted all segments of its business, from cloud services, to retail, advertising, and groceries. Amazon Inc submitted the records of job reduction for New York, California, New Jersey, Washington, and show how sharply engineering was affected. Around 40% were in engineering positions of the 4,700 layoffs recorded in the state, according to data Amazon provided through Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings. WARN data showed that the cuts affected engineers at various levels but disproportionately hit software development engineering staff or the mid-level software developers. The layoffs affected more than 500 product managers and programme managers across states that field notice. They account for 10% of the total job cuts. Another section which bore the hardest hit was the gamining segment. California's WARM data showed that significant reduction in its San Diego and Irvine Studios as well as central publishing. There is no data for other states, which indicates that the figure is only a part of wider cuts. The workforce reduction happened as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy continued to overhaul for the company's internal culture. Amazon said that the artificial intelligence was not the main reason behind the layoffs. The company has reduced the workforce to reduce layers, speeding up decisions. Another wave of job cut is due on January, 2026.
