Title: Employees are sick and tired of 'engagement surveys' at work

"Satisfaction surveys" promise to make offices happier. Do they work? Iwas in a particularly sour mood at an old job one afternoon when a notification popped up in Slack, reminding me to fill out my Peakon, the employee engagement survey our HR department used. In exchange for our candor, the HR team promised total anonymity and assured us that our concerns and comments would be heard by top brass. I liked my job, so I typically filled these surveys out with a perfunctory four-out-of-five-star acquiescence, never eager to rock the boat. I truly cannot recall now what had made my day so bad, but I decided to take it out on the survey. In response to extremely mundane questions about my daily motivation and whether my work goals were clearly defined, I said things like this organization absolutely stinks and our customers are marks. I was specific without revealing my identity, but I lurched roundhouse kicks like no sane person would work here if they had a better option. With the vitriol of an anonymous Yelp reviewer, I let 'er rip. It felt amazing — in the moment. The next morning, I found in my inbox a letter from the CEO. Sent via Peakon, it said something to the effect of, I can't tell who you are. But it seems you're unhappy. I have an offer for you. If I identified myself and then resigned, they'd give me a bit more than a standard severance. My resignation would be written as a layoff, so I could collect unemployment, and they'd even hook me up with the external recruiters they used to staff the company, to help me find a better role in some place where I would be happier. My employer was not doing layoffs or buyouts, and no one else, to my knowledge, had gotten this kind of offer. It seemed the object of my unhappiness at work had struck a nerve. While you may have a manager who genuinely loves you and wants you to be happy, the reality is that from an organizational perspective, your happiness at work has a literal, and hefty, price tag. Companies spend a fortune finding and hiring talent; it can cost 15% to 25% of a role's salary to source the right person to fill an opening. Maybe my old CEO (who through a representative declined to comment for this story) agreed strongly with the market firm MSW's survey that found that disengaged workers are 2.5 times as likely as an engaged worker to leave a company, and he just wanted me to get on with it. A Gallup survey found that about one-third of US workers were "actively engaged" at work in 2023, with the larger pool of less engaged and "actively disengaged" workers (who make mistakes at work more often and show up to work less often) accounting for an estimated $1.9 trillion in lost productivity. Our "engagement" — the quality by which work feels immediate and meaningful — was defined as recently as 1990 by the Boston University professor of organizational behavior William Kahn, whose studies around employee engagement transformed how corporations think about workforce productivity. Employees who are not able to engage with their jobs are rendered "emotionally, cognitively and psychologically unavailable," as Kahn has put it. Negative and positive engagement is now considered an indicator of both positive and negative lagging effects for businesses, including profitability, turnover, and employee absenteeism. So for the last 35 years, HR departments everywhere have created a culture of questionnaires determined to uncover, isolate, and nurture their company's engagement. There's a very good chance you've been pinged and asked sometime in the past few months to fill out your Deel engagement survey, or your ThriveSparrow, SurveyMonkey, Workleap, Paycom, Lattice, People Element, or Engagedly. Software companies generated almost a billion dollars in 2023 selling and administering third-party engagement surveys to corporations everywhere. Peakon sold to Workday in 2021 for $700 million. A 2021 fundraising round catapulted the Melbourne, Australia-founded engagement startup Culture Amp to unicorn status, with a $1.5 billion valuation. The action is picking up, as increasingly dispersed post-COVID workforces have exacerbated the need for more vibe checks. If you're in the business of soliciting opinions from employees, business is booming. Less satisfied with employee satisfaction surveys are many of the employees taking them. Some two-thirds of US employees believe their companies don't respond to engagement surveys in a meaningful way, according to a Quantum Workplace survey of more than a thousand workers. "Employee surveys mostly seem like a way for the executive suite to pat themselves on the back," Nick Gaudio, the creative director at the Austin-based chatbot startup Manychat, tells me. "They want to believe in the power of anonymity to induce honesty, but at the end of the day, the power dynamic is always there, hanging over the head of their employees." While I experienced a surprising assertion of this power dynamics firsthand — my bosses didn't like my answers, and tried to do something about it — in general, the people I spoke to for this story placed surveys in the taxonomic rank of workplace annoyances somewhere around "filling out timesheets." Surveys can be annoying because they're persistent, doubly so when you perceive that your employers won't do much with the results. This can lead to survey fatigue, where the response rate falls off a cliff after being asked to submit too many. When you're constantly filing your anonymous grievances into an anonymous digital suggestion box, you may begin to wonder not if the survey will help improve your workplace, but if you aren't perhaps participating in a kind of "snitchware." Are you voluntarily telling on yourself? If we survey the history of surveys, we find that they were once considered novel, exciting, and based in real utility, much as the kanban project management board was born out of a working system in a real factory. Before World War I, most bosses were primarily concerned with their employees' external lives and work outcomes — the inner toils and happiness quotients mattered very little, as the historian Sanford Jacoby wrote in a 2008 paper called "Employee Attitude Surveys in Historical Perspective." But strikes and wartime labor shortages gave the workforce some modicum of power. This gave the educational psychologist J. David Houser the perfect platform to take the "consumer attitude studies" he'd been doing on behalf of public utilities into an entirely new field of study: employee satisfaction and morale. By the early 1940s, satisfaction surveys found a champion in the armed forces. Because soldier morale began to be considered paramount to defense success, the military took the results of personnel surveys seriously. This led to some drastic changes, including introducing combat badges, requiring psychological evaluations for returned soldiers, and even helping along the eventual desegregation of the armed forces. (Today, the government's Office of Personnel Management notably conducts agency- and government-wide surveys as a resource for the public trust.) Decades later, Kahn, "the godfather of employee engagement," set up a brilliant framework for understanding employee satisfaction outside the binary of happy/sad. That same anonymity that Gaudio railed against can also promote a kind of equity. Jenna Eichberg, the chief people officer at AlertMedia, tells me that because surveys aggregate an entire organization's feedback, you don't have to overindex your worry about the loudest outliers. "You can't chase one person. You're here to serve a majority of your workforce," she says, and the beauty of the big dataset is that you can hear just as much from shy employees, or from "people who're different than the ones who mostly talk to you in person." Phil Wilburn, the VP of people analytics at Workday, agrees. A survey, he tells me over email, "gives people who might not feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting — whether they're introverted, more junior, or part of an underrepresented group — a safe space to share their thoughts. And it helps managers respond to those concerns thoughtfully, without putting anyone on the spot." Still, Eichberg says, if your employees don't feel heard, it's because you're not making them feel heard. "The biggest mistake organizations make is they do all these surveys and they collect all this data, but they don't actually do something with it," she says. "Or they do something with it, and they don't go back and tell their workforce what they did with it." The head of people at a small LA-based startup tells me that his organization similarly seems to freeze whenever a surprising result or answer pops out of the survey black box. "I tell my CEO that by the time a comment winds up in the survey, it's already tried to reach you some other way," he says. Surveys, he continues, are "only as good as the relationships between the people in the company and only as effective as the executives who have to do something about it." So while anonymity can lend itself to candor and equity, it might still sometimes fail in the way of promoting actual conversation and trust. Consider a 2021 survey from The Workforce Institute that found that only 37% of entry-level employees believe their colleagues are completely honest in their answers and assessments. If 43% of workers fear retaliation for speaking up at work, per a survey from the Institute of Business Ethics, anonymity can only help so much. In the same way remote employees have learned to keep their Slack icon "green," to avoid suspicion of blowing off work, some workers have self-taught to never be entirely honest with their HR surveys. Last year at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo requiring five-days-a-week RTO, touching on connection and communication as principal tenets for this decision. Enough workers were dissatisfied enough to launch their own internal survey about RTO, an ironic Uno reverse card usage of the employee questionnaire to critique how little they felt the self-declared "Earth's Best Employer" was listening. A former boss once lamented to me that surveys are, by design, akin to "interviewing for pain" — regardless of their intention, they tend to draw out complaints and gripes that aren't as serious as they seem. This may be true, but when you consider the total anonymity of the survey, how is a boss supposed to tell the genuine complaint from the Reddit-like bloviating? In a work world with increasingly labyrinthine and opaque hiring processes, the crisis of "ghost jobs," and built on the legacy of Michael Scott hating Toby, it's not surprising that we're mired in an ongoing HR credibility crisis, with so many workers rejecting the supposed efficacy and value of something as supposedly useful as surveys. When I ask William Kahn about this hierarchical arrangement and fear of self-reporting, he tells me that "ideally, there would be no need for surveys that are in the service of helping managers understand the experiences, thoughts, and insights of their workers." In an open, trusting workplace, he says, "communication would flow freely based on the idea that the work and healthy relationships matter more than the need of managers to be adored and obeyed." Even so, he adds, "surveys would still be useful to get quick checks on the results of interventions designed to enable workers to fully engage their work." I ended up not taking my CEO's stunning buyout offer. I was a diligent, productive, and engaged worker, and I believe the CEO was conflating and confusing this engagement with my happiness. Kahn tells me that "highly engaged members are satisfied with their roles and experiences," but "whether they are 'happy' or not — which has as much to do with the totality of their lives — is a different matter." More importantly, that CEO seemed to see the survey results as an end point, evidence of some unfixable condition, and not some part of a workforce to maintain, nurture, and encourage. They supposed that if only we could have more engaged workers, we'd be better off, without contending that the survey revealed opportunity, not a definitive answer. It was, ironically, the moment I thought of most often when I did make the decision to leave the following year. Matt Alston's writing has appeared in Wired, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Believer.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

Save 35% on an annual Digiday+ membership. This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it. Google’s hook is that you spend most of your money with Google, you’ll want to use their agents to connect to Google Ads and your data seamlessly.” Webster, formerly a senior executive at WPP’s media investment arm, notes that this AI arms race should cause concern among regulators — Bloomberg likewise reported such DOJ scrutiny last week — with the concerns raised about Google’s AI an echo of those documented in the most recent antitrust case. “From a DOJ point of view, isn’t that a control game… these agents will do things like decide budgets, decide bids, decide planning, and what creative to run,” observed Webster. “If they’re built on Google systems, will Google be able to tweak them to help Google?” “Everything is broken, because it’s designed to be that way… There’s a lot of people out there who are just afraid to ask the right questions, and AI is only going to intensify that.” – A veteran media agency exec discusses how history seems to be repeating itself at the recent Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit, where agency execs grumbled over measurement and attribution. WTF just happened to the IAB Europe’s TCF — and what does it mean for targeted ads in the EU? Perplexity is burning through cash, quickly While the AI-powered search engine has been able to increase its subscription revenue and users in the past 12 months, that growth has come at a large cost. According to The Information, Perplexity generated $34 million in revenue in 2024, but burned through $65 million in cash, which was spent on cloud servers and AI models which power much of its answers. Meta’s attempt to get its antitrust case thrown out failed The FTC’s battle against Meta kicked off on April 14, but Meta has since tried to have the case thrown out. However, on May 20, Judge Boasberg denied Meta’s motion, which asked him to rule against the FTC before it had even launched its defense case, according to The Verge. As TikTok’s U.S. existence is still in limbo, Shop staff are being laid off U.S. TikTok Shop staff were told to work from home on May 21, as they waited to receive emails regarding “difficult decisions,” which everyone understood to mean job cuts, according to Bloomberg. The layoffs follow leadership changes, including those in TikTok Shop which saw Mu, a former exec of Douyin’s (TikTok’s Chinese counterpart) e-commerce arm, take over the platform’s U.S. operations. ‘Marching off a cliff’: Developers at Microsoft Build question their future relevance’ Microsoft Build presenters celebrated the company’s latest advancements in AI, including multi-agent AI orchestration in Copilot Studio, the NLWeb protocol for natural language web interaction, and the integration of xAI’s Grok models into Azure AI Foundry. All these emphasize a shift toward an open agentic web. However, as Semafor’s Rachyl Jones noted, the mood on the floor was not so bullish, noting how one attendee asked: “Is there going to be a Build 2035, or will there not be any more developers?” At the three-year-old media agency, Mediaplus, the operating philosophy is about personal touch and being a side-by-side partner to clients. Canvas’ full-funnel offering emphasizes data-side and performance chops in a way that balances the need for upper-funnel wisdom and lower-funnel insights Pundits believe Google’s antitrust remedies will produce a similar result; optimists eye opportunity for independents.

Title: Walmart layoffs: Who is Suresh Kumar, Indian-origin CTO called out by social media users amid recent job cuts?

Suresh Kumar, the Indian origin chief technology officer of Walmart in California, has hit the headlines amid reports of the retail giant cutting 1,500 tech jobs. Walmart is cutting jobs at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, along with its global technology team. In a memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Walmart CTO Suresh Kumar and US CEO John Furner indicated that the decision to reduce the workforce by nearly 1,500 employees is intended to speed up decision-making and lessen complexities. After reports on layoffs emerged, several social media users blamed CTO Suresh Kumar for the recent layoffs. Suresh Kumar is the executive vice president, global chief technology officer (CTO), and chief development officer (CDO) of Walmart. With more than three decades of experience in the tech industry, he has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Suresh Kumar currently lives in Sunnyvale, California. Speaking to the Times of India earlier, Kumar shared that he was born in Basavanagudi, Bengaluru and spent his childhood there. Kumar pursued his Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. He secured a PhD in control systems from Princeton University. The Walmart CTO recently shared his experience of studying at IIT. In a post on LinkedIn, he wrote, “I completed my undergrad time in the late ‘80s, and one truth still stands out: learning never stops.” He also offered guidance for recent graduates, encouraging them to stay curious, connect with inspiring individuals, and take pride in their work. Kumar's post read, “Stay curious. Don’t just master your role - learn how your work connects to the bigger picture. Curiosity is a career superpower. Seek out people who inspire you. Ask questions. Listen deeply. Mentorship can come from unexpected places—look for those who challenge your thinking.” He further added, “Take pride in your work. Excellence starts with the mindset you bring every day. The habits you build early on will shape your path.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: TikTok enters its efficiency era
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-tiktok-new-efficiency-era-layoffs-cost-saving-measures-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-24T08:17:01Z

Belt-tightening is underway at TikTok. After spending big over the last two years to get its e-commerce business off the ground, TikTok is taking new steps to squeeze out a return. Since February, TikTok Shop has pushed out staffers based on performance, added stricter return-to-office rules, and had two rounds of layoffs, all while tacking on new measures to keep costs at bay, seven staffers told Business Insider. TikTok has also introduced cost-cutting measures to the broader company, including new budget caps for travel. On Wednesday, the company began its latest layoffs, targeting e-commerce operations staff and some employees who work with global brands. In emails this week to laid-off workers, the company said it was reducing complexity "to create a more efficient operating model for the team's long-term growth." TikTok's CEO Shou Chew hinted at a spending crackdown in the pursuit of efficiency in February. He told staff he wanted to review each of the company's teams and remove unnecessary layers, The Information reported. Chew's directive mirrors similar efforts by executives at Meta, Microsoft, and Google, which have recently stripped away employee perks, trimmed head count, and shifted performance standards in pursuit of cost savings. TikTok's cost cuts come at a tenuous moment for the company, which could face a US ban if it fails to reach an agreement with the Trump administration over a 2024 divestment law. The company has made broad changes to its US team in recent months, including consolidating control under Chinese leadership, employees previously told BI. And while TikTok videos are as popular as ever, the Shop business has failed to meet expectations. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The workplace changes and broader uncertainty have weighed on some. "For the past six months, it's been very up and down as far as morale and people's sense of security at work," a laid off staffer said. In addition to cutting costs through layoffs, some teams have refocused performance goals this quarter around costs, profit, and revenue metrics like gross merchandise value, two staffers said. The company also plans to stop subsidizing free shipping for TikTok Shop sellers later this month after previous reductions. The move would bring TikTok's free shipping subsidies more in line with competitors like Amazon, but could irk some seller partners, one staffer said. There have been signs of broader cost cutting, too. Last week, TikTok told staffers across the company it was instituting a stricter approval process for work travel. The company is asking for more information about travel arrangements to better understand the impact on the budget, and setting spend limits for hotels and airfare. TikTok's e-commerce division was an easy target for cost cutting. The company spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting the business off the ground. The shopping platform is a big focus for owner ByteDance, which is trying to replicate the e-commerce success of its Chinese sister app, Douyin. ByteDance's leadership has been disappointed with the progress of its US business, which failed to hit many of its goals in 2024. US sales on the platform have taken a hit this year, due partly to global tariffs. Weekly US order volume on TikTok Shop dropped by around 20% in mid-May compared to mid-April after tariffs went into effect, for example, according to internal data viewed by BI. In an effort to turn things around, the company has shaken up its e-commerce leadership. The changes gave greater power to executives who have experience working on Douyin. After several layoff rounds, a string of performance-related cuts and team reorgs, and other unrelated worker attrition, the US TikTok Shop is looking trimmer. BI was unable to determine the extent of the recent cuts, but the impacted teams were consolidated, per a memo sent on Wednesday evening and viewed by BI. In the wake of organizational changes, the teams would "move faster, operate leaner, and be more efficient," e-commerce leader Mu Qing wrote. Have a tip?

By JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a long-standing U.S. ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” That post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: Why CEOs Should Develop AI Acumen To Lead In 2025 And Beyond

ByRussell Sarder ByRussell Sarder, Forbes Councils Member. Chairman & CEO Russell Sarder leads NetCom Learning with a mission to build a world of lifelong learners. Today’s CEOs face challenges their predecessors couldn’t have imagined. From ethical concerns to governance complexities and workforce upheaval, the stakes are high. To face these challenges, numerous industries, including supply chain management and customer service, are revolutionizing their workforces through the use of AI tools. In fact, studies show that as much as 30% of tasks in 60% of jobs (registration required) can be automated by AI. A few months ago, I caught up with a friend who is the CEO of a mid-sized tech firm. He had felt behind on AI integration, unsure of how to incorporate it into his business. But after diving into AI, he implemented it in his customer service operations. The result was a significant surge in customer satisfaction within months. This was a complete transformation, not just a small improvement. I believe this underscores a lesson we all need to internalize: Rather than being just another tool, AI is an important part of a competitive strategy in today's market. AI isn’t going away; rather, it's reshaping businesses. According to a Cisco study, 75% of leaders state confidence that AI will open new opportunities and disrupt their industry, and 83% already consider it a strategic necessity. I've witnessed in my own company how using AI-driven analytics to predict demand and optimize inventory can lead to reduced waste, cost savings and the ability to anticipate market trends. However, implementing AI effectively can be more challenging than leaders anticipate. According to a study, many are underprepared for the expected AI disruption to their industry: 62% of surveyed companies experience difficulties in cross-functional alignment during implementation, and 63% struggle to adjust workflows. What's more, research shows that "51% of IT leaders (registration required) cited governance and regulatory compliance challenges as their primary concern with AI initiatives." Integrating AI isn’t just about increasing efficiency—it can also help with differentiation. Think about Amazon. Its AI-driven recommendation algorithm doesn’t just suggest products—it predicts what you’ll want based on your browsing habits. That's part of why Amazon sales are sky-high. On the other hand, Nvidia suffered a $593 billion market value loss in a single day due to a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI innovator. DeepSeek’s energy-efficient AI model outpaced Nvidia’s, shifting the balance of power. Similarly, Intel’s failure to keep up in the AI chip market led to layoffs and a $10 billion reduction in capital spending. These losses emphasize both how AI is disrupting industries and how important it is for CEOs to prepare for this shift in order to protect market share and company valuation. In my experience, CEOs cannot afford to delegate AI knowledge. You need to grasp AI in order to make informed decisions about investments, AI models or governance frameworks. While 75% of executives rank AI among their top three strategic priorities, only 16% of organizations have met their AI-related goals. I believe this gap is because AI success hinges less on technology and more on the CEO's active, visible leadership. To bridge the gap, pursue AI literacy with intent. This means understanding what AI can and cannot do, as well as how it applies to your business. Start by exploring credible resources like online courses, executive programs and industry reports. I also recommend participating in roundtables, summits and AI governance forums to engage with evolving norms and practices. Understanding how AI may optimize interconnected functions requires more than simply installing a solution in one area of your company. For instance, by strategically incorporating AI into HR and Operations, you can potentially raise staff engagement and make your team more unified and effective. You can also leverage AI tools to promote comprehensive plans that improve multiple areas at once, such as improving customer satisfaction, streamlining processes and raising employee satisfaction levels. McKinsey’s 2025 analysis reveals a pronounced asymmetry: 13% of employees indicate that GenAI now comprises over 30% of their daily functions, yet C-suite leaders estimate that only 4% of their employees have reached that level. This disparity helps underscore the importance of education initiatives. In my experience, effective AI training begins by anchoring learning to real business impact. Strengthen your training frameworks by balancing conceptual grounding with applied experience. Initial sessions should introduce essential concepts, clarify the boundaries of what AI can and cannot do and address common misconceptions. From there, shift into practical immersion. Identify one high-impact area, like sales forecasting, customer support or inventory planning, and pilot a focused solution. Use that project as both proof of value and a learning vehicle. Once it has been validated, scale with discipline and with training embedded at each stage. Finally, training should be seen as an ongoing process. One common pitfall I've encountered is the assumption that early exposure is sufficient. Another is over-relying on third-party programs without building internal ownership. One of the most damaging missteps, however, is deploying AI technologies in production environments before equipping your teams to use them ethically, accurately and with contextual understanding. As Ben Cook, president of Acumen Learning, warns, "If you don’t understand the business, you have no business using AI." Today, the flip side is equally important: If you don’t understand AI, you could struggle to lead your business in 2025. To lead in the AI-driven future, I believe we, as CEOs, must experiment with AI, learn new things constantly and establish a strong foundation within our companies. The question isn’t if AI will reshape your industry—it’s whether you’ll be the disruptor or the disrupted. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump’s postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president’s statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. Recommended Videos The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes.

He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters.The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports.“Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.”Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States.“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.”The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger.

The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes.

Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states.

Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.

He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.

Brooke Sjoberg In recent years, many large companies have chosen to embrace automated intelligence to help produce leaner, more efficient operations at the corporate level. For the most part, this has mostly occurred in the technology sector at companies like Microsoft, as well as Google and Amazon. A total of about 61,000 technology sector jobs have been caught in the crossfire of layoffs in the wake of companies adopting AI. But it’s not just tech companies, as retail businesses have entered the chat. Even the company known for the smiling faces of its door greeters has fallen to AI use. That’s right—the company known for literal smiley faces as part of its branding in the early aughts has announced it will lay off 1,500 of its employees at the corporate level. Most of these positions are concentrated in the Bentonville, Arkansas, and Hoboken, New Jersey hubs, as reported by FingerLakes1.com. According to reporting on the issue from FingerLakes, the Bentonville-headquartered company is choosing to restructure to “sharpen focus” and embrace automation. The cuts were described by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Global Chief Technology Officer Suresh Kumar in a joint letter to employees as necessary for building the “future of retail,” FingerLakes reports. “We are eliminating roles as well as opening some new ones aligned with our business priorities and growth strategy,” the memo shared with employees reads. The use of automated intelligence in the retail space has become a hot-button issue for many retailers. Just as Walmart has made its intention to use AI in corporate roles public, Starbucks has elected to “go slow” on its rollout of AI and focus on higher staffing. Notably, Amazon began using AI-powered audio product summaries to help shoppers learn more about other customers’ experiences. On the customer-facing side of operations, Walmart is also reportedly preparing for shoppers to use AI to build grocery lists and potentially make purchasing decisions for them. As the company catches heat amid national conversations about tariffs, company officials have reportedly confirmed that the retailer will absorb some of the cost increase, as well as pass a portion of it to consumers. Regarding layoffs, impacted employees will receive support in this transition, representatives of Walmart said, as reported by FingerLakes. Despite the cuts, the company said it would likely be adding positions related to AI and “digital transformation.” Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.
