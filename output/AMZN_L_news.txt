Title: GameStop set to close over 410 US stores in early 2026 as CEO’s $35 billion stock award causes massive outrage

GameStop is reportedly shuttering hundreds of stores in the United States, with recent estimates predicting that around 295 to 410 locations will close in the first quarter of 2026. This does not include the 590 stores that closed down last year. Meanwhile, as reported by Reuters, GameStop's CEO has been awarded performance-based stock options estimated to be worth around $35 billion, provided the company meets a performance milestone of over $100 billion in market capitalization and around $10 billion in net EBITDA. Cohen became GameStop’s CEO in September 2023 and is the company’s largest shareholder. He doesn’t receive a salary or a guaranteed bonus. Instead, he aims to be compensated through performance milestones. Notices about the latest round of closures appeared on social media and were subsequently compiled into lists on sites such as the “GameStop Closing List” and the official GameStop Subreddit (now removed by moderators). These reports detail confirmed shuttered locations and potential rumors of store closures across states such as New York and Connecticut. Recent reports state that select GameStop sites at Enfield Square Mall in Connecticut and Lenox Square Mall in Georgia closed in early January. Former employees are, of course, frustrated with the layoffs, as these job cuts follow GameStop’s February 2025 SEC filing, which detailed: We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While the review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025. For context, GameStop’s fiscal year 2025 ends on January 31, 2026, meaning more unfortunate closures are on the horizon for what was once considered the go-to store for video games a few years ago. GameStop is also scaling down internationally. The company has sold its Italian operations and shuttered locations in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. In addition, the company plans to divest its Canadian branch. Currently, rumors are circulating that GameStop is considering closing stores in New Zealand, where 38 stores operate.

After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book. With the 26-year-old's purchase of "Decode and Conquer," author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers. Over the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November. "I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections," said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. "The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.

Read more on the topic: When Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends. After the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way. Apparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer. Her friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce. "There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people," said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. "But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us." Looking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes. "The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful," she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for. In the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added "open to work" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok. Last May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable. Chen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York. Weeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon. Support from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers. Last July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Beyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said. Apparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process. "Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating," she said. "Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer." Apparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive. "Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help," she said. Jump to

Title: Weekend reading: Alas Smith and the active investing Joneses

Time Published: 2026-01-10T11:36:55Z

What caught my eye this week. The formerly fêted fund manager Terry Smith has had a few rough years in the markets, but last year was a doozy. The UK investors who once poured money into his flagship Fundsmith vehicle saw their domestic market deliver nearly 26% in 2025. A global tracker – a better comparison for the free-roaming Fundsmith – delivered roughly 14%. But Fundsmith managed just a 0.8% return. Barely there, and handily outpaced by cash in the bank. Now Terry Smith is a big and famously acerbic boy who has rained on many a parade over his long career. While the schadenfreude must be positively Wagnerian in some quarters and it’s never nice to kick a man while he’s down, he doesn’t need me defending him. I will just a tad though. Like Nick Train – another once-loved but now seemingly reviled fund manager 1 – Smith invests exclusively in ‘quality’ type shares. This doesn’t (just) mean ‘quality’ the way a car salesman might quip about that vehicle you’re eyeing up. The quality factor describes a particular kind of company that boasts – among other things – high returns on equity, strong profit margins, and the ability to turn most of its profit into cash. And since the reset of 2022, these kinds of companies have been in the doghouse. I know because I favour them with my stock picking myself. Although happily my returns in 2025 were an order of magnitude better than Smith’s. (But now I’m doing the schadenfreude dance…) Of course, Smith and Train didn’t exactly call out the tailwinds that boosted their returns during the low interest rate era. Worrywarts like me saw ‘bond proxy’ companies increasingly owned by weak hands who would rather be invested in bonds, and which were thus primed for a fall when interest rates rose. Train in particular dismissed such concerns, while Smith just continued to talk like you’d need a lobotomy to own anything other than his favoured firms. But when the reckoning came, those multiples duly corrected – and the share prices went south. The fact that even good investors suffer when their style is out of favour is of course another of the many arguments for passive investing. I’m one of diminishing band who still believes both Smith and Train have skill. But I also think most people should invest the bulk of their money in index funds, rather than bet their net worth on either the jockey or the horse they’re riding. However Smith has continued to lend his voice to the chorus warning that those same index funds are part of a wider problem. In his letter to investors this week, he recapped the now-common argument that the growing share of money invested in index funds is distorting the market, concluding: …even if we are right in diagnosing this move to index funds as one of the causes of our recent underperformance and it is laying the foundations of a major investment disaster, I have no clue how or when it will end except to say badly. He would say that, wouldn’t he? He’s an active fund manager. Well no. The greatest active investor of all-time, Warren Buffett, cheerily urges people – including his wife – to put their money into tracker funds. For my part, I am not sure exactly what I think. While Smith’s recap in his letter on the perils of excessive indexing is uncharacteristically muddled, I’ve read more persuasive arguments as to why the weight of money in index funds is distorting prices. At least at the margin and especially for the biggest companies. (Here’s the latest). I’ve also read comprehensive counters too. Now you may wonder why someone who has been writing a blog about both active and passive investing for 20 years cannot be more definitive about this? The truth is the maths is non-trivial and it’d take a good chunk of time to separate theoretical outcomes from any real-world implications. So I’m leaving it to the investing titans to argue it out. With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do. But whether they will be enough to make any meaningful difference – let alone be something that should prompt everyday investors to return to paying the known cost of active investing – is another matter altogether. On a practical level, if I was a passive investor I might favour equal-weighted funds a bit more, though that’s been a losing bet for years. Then I’d wait to see what happens! There’s no world in which index funds crash while a preponderance of active funds soar, that’s for sure. Remember, active funds basically are the market. 2 If passive and index investing has been unduly inflating prices, then beyond the edge cases it’s doing it for all investors. Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Surely this idea that indexing is causing overvalution is absolute nonsense? Like before indexing we never had overvaluation/ undervaluation in the market? Look at 1929, and more recently the late 1990s bubble and the subsequent drop after 1999. Human nature causes bubbles and their collapse, not indexing. @Indexing — Agree with the historical perspective. I’d have a read of the literature though before using the phrase “absolute nonsense”. If I was going to redux the argument down, it’s something like passive investing flows into the very largest index funds are sort of like a valuation agnostic active momentum fund funelling money into the market. (Remember, even index funds are ‘active’ in that they follow rules as to what firms to include and exclude, and in what weightings). So in that sense it’s the same as it ever was — just like big active funds in the 1960s or the late 1990s — but under a new guise. There’s then a bunch of maths overlaid onto that about demand/supply inelasticity and whatnot. In a simple world as I understood it, index funds just bought ‘the market’ and active funds traded against each other and were the market. But there are coherent arguments that at this scale quantity has a quality all of its own, as Napoleon said. Still, as noted in the piece, I’m not persuaded it’s an argument for active investing unless you want to go *very* active (e.g. buying small cap active funds to avoid an alleged large cap bubble) and that comes with a plethora of very known and real issues. If any bubble pops, however it was caused, then everyone will go down together, more or less, though no doubt some funds will do relatively better (including, perhaps, quality and value focused funds, which have struggled for so long versus tech/growth…) Fair enough, absolute nonsense is probably a bit harsh. But the idea bubbles are caused by indexing I think is a mistake. Bubbles or extreme price moves in both directions have occurred in all markets, not just stocks, since records began. Most of these markets did not have any form of indexing. On my long investing journey (am now 80) I remember my first convincing star manager Ian Rutherford of Personal Assets Trust whose investing outlook perfectly fitted my conservative investing feelings.Alas he was taken from us too soon -rather emphasising one of the problems of relying on “star” managers Various other heroes like Jim Slater shot briefly and brightly across the investing firmament -there were many of his ilk Realising that putting faith in one person was a fraught investing policy-how does a mere amateur investor pick the winners? Index investing eventually came to the rescue via Vanguard and John Bogle to my great investing relief-no educated guesswork needed I very much enjoy reading about the success of Terry Smith etc but then a Woodford comes along……… Index investing is very boring but retirement finances need to be 100% successful-so boring is OK with me Indexing has done the job for me-so far!-However I keep reading financial news-Monevator etc-but so far all it does is reinforce my current conservative investing policy but who knows down the line what might appear…….. xxd09 A very good article The Investor, which I thought was very balanced. Thank you. I have to confess that Fundsmith is the only active fund that I currently hold in my portfolio (less than 5% of it), with everything else being trackers (apart from one ‘fun’ individual company share). I have had it a long while now and, in the past, it has been good to me (186% up). I invested in it because I like Terry Smith (the UK’s Warren Buffet- we hoped) and how he talks. Although for the last five years his defence of his track record has become less and less convincing. I am curious to see what happens in the future. If in the next few years, he hugely underperforms the market does he decide that reducing the funds 1% management charge might be in order? ( I think Warren Buffet would). In fairness to him he does have integrity and is rich enough not to care about what other people think of him. A while back, buoyed by the success of Fundsmith, I invested in his FEET fund, basically Fundsmith in Emerging Markets. It was not a success (better to have bought an EM tracker). He run it for a few years before handing over to two of his team (who couldn’t improve it). He wound up FEET BUT the pay out was generous compared to the final share price (from memory I don’t think I lost any money on it apart from opportunity cost). With regard to his latest tirade against the unfairness of the all-encompassing passive trackers (I admit I haven’t actually read his words) I think he is on a sticky wicket. Passive trackers are here to stay – too bad, get over it. There is a truism in economics – You can never buck a trend! Seems to make some sense that passive flows could distort the stock market and lead to some misallocation of capital. But then, this should create opportunities that active managers can exploit, and we’re not seeing that. Active managers still underperform the market on average, and afaik the level of underperformance has been roughly the same over the past decades (and the rise of index funds). Academic economists usually work with “spherical horse in vacuum”-type assumptions. I think we’re better off relying on practical observations. Index funds it is for me, until I see active stock managers actually outperform. That said, if quality-factor stocks are so unloved at the moment, maybe it’s a good time to take a punt. @indexing #1 & #3: that’s not a claim being made under the Inelastic Markets Hypothesis (it’s a straw man point). The IMH does not postulate that passive flows ’cause’ overvaluation and/or crashes (at least per se). Rather, the IMH merely claims that, beyond a certain point, due to both increasing net passive flows and increasing passive share (dominance), public markets become increasingly less elastic, less informationally efficient (in terms of informed price discovery) and that larger caps weight stocks become progressively overweighted compared to their effective crisis liquidity (i.e. ever less effective liquidity under stress per unit of capitalisation): See Monevator here: “Why market cap investing still works”. March 4, 2025, @me #80 Here: “Passive investing, edge, and market efficiency: winners need losers”, September 19, 2024, @me #11 Here: “Weekend reading: oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms?” September 7, 2024, @ZX #16 and immediately following. Here: “Weekend reading: Fama and fortune”. August 31, 2024, @me #3 and #9 And here: “Weekend reading: We all feel the pain of active fund managers now.” February 9, 2024, @ZX #16 and @me #37 For the avoidance of doubt IMH is not an argument for active management. Index investing will clearly follow a trend and NEW money will reinforce that trend. In the present market we can underweight the stocks / region that we perceive as overvalued. At some point the markets fall, is that the correction or just a dip…. Given we feel the market has fallen, how do we respond ? A logical answer is that a tracker is the route out , we don’t know what will rise again most quickly , “if you can’t find the needle buy the haystack “ So we need to veer away from the market tracker and then head back in, timing is tough. It’s worth thinking back to 1988/89 Japanese market was very expensive and was 45% of the world index (iirc) and USA was 25% but when it crashed big time in 1989 , the world index fell but within a couple of years the index had largely recovered… Perhaps that might point to how the AI excitement might play out ? Peter Thiel, seriously? @Ian — It’s an excellent book. I don’t share the man’s politics but he understands 21st Century business! Terry Smith and Nick train get a lot of credit for their factor happening to outperform in the early days of their funds’ launch. Terry Smith’s long term track record (and short term track record for that matter) looks a lot less impressive if you pick an appropriate benchmark with a similar factor exposure (the MSCI World Quality index say, rather that the MSCI World). I would say that index funds exaggerate (and perhaps highlight?) strongly held beliefs. So the US Exceptionalism concept has a key impact on the allocation of the global trackers. Then at a lower level in the UK you do have shares at very unusually low valuations (for example, retail is generally trading both on low earnings and earnings multipliers). With others at better values. These are both beliefs about where value should or shouldn’t be, but both could be temporary. And index funds are led by the hand by these beliefs. The advantage of the active investor or an investor in industry ETFs is they can go against these preconceptions, which may work well IF they are right (this is basically Buffet, Graham etc). At its core – index funds are not God – they contain mistakes, but at its core they can be reduced to generalizations, and understood. The problem is it takes a lot of time and energy to understand the generalizations in an index, and with most market commentary being misleading at best, the question is whether it’s worth extra time of effort. That I think will forever be debated – but there will be cycles where indexes outperform, and cycles where they don’t. The smaller houses lead to happier lives article is interesting. There’s a lot to be said for living in a good community. I think i heard Naval say similar on a podcast they’ve purposely chosen to live in a smaller house in a nice community rather than a remote mansion. It’s hard deciding on size of home more space isn’t always better seem to get filled with junk. The population chart isn’t good. Without wanting to bring the b word into it if that was a vote for sovereignty then the Boris wave was a proper kick in the teeth. Now we seem to be in a situation where we have a brain drain of talent and a policy of importing less desirable (pc term) low skilled people. When are we going to see govt embrace autonomous driving and lay off importing uber drivers? Re “With that said, I’ve mentioned to my co-blogger The Accumulator that, on a gut level, I suspect indexing becoming mainstream will have some kind of downside. Apparent free lunches in investing always do.” I think your gut-level theory falls down on the point of equating index investing with a free lunch. Most active participants are trying to beat the market, indexers are accepting average which I don’t see as a free lunch. They’re already resigned to the fact they won’t beat the market, but are happy to settle for that, knowing they’ll have lower costs, less mental work, etc. @Scott — the free lunch here would be relying on the work of active investors to analyse and try to put the correct value on shares. “The market” is a result of that work at any moment in time (plus or minus any disputed in elasticity effects…) I suppose one could argue that the active investors are effectively squabbling over the bill themselves in terms of the Gains/losses netting out, but nevertheless there’s billions of dollars of work here index investors aren’t paying for. Of course how many billions are required to keep a market efficient is open to debate. I’d be very open to believing it’s a lot less than is still being paid today! 🙂 Enjoyed the BBC piece on willpower. There are so many mysteries in obesity which get little attention as we’re still stuck on the now discredited calories in, calories out model. It’s the only large scale public health intervention which has not only not worked but gotten worse (including other interventions which also require ‘willpower’ like smoking cessation). On The Root of All article, symbols and ritual are thought to have a role in nourishing the non-propositional machinery beneath the intellectual abstract world we consciously inhabit. There has in a way always been tracker funds and a lot of money in them. Just a different name, closet trackers, basically a tracker fund where an a manager fiddled around the edges and called it an active fund. If you went to your local bank you tended to end up in one of those. There will always be actively managed funds, hope springs eternal. I’m not surprised Terry Smith is blaming his poor performance on index trackers its a common practice by politicians etc, blame someone/something else. That way you get your customers to shift their focus away from your poor performance. I wonder how the active v passive argument will play out once the much predicted correction occurs. I suspect that global trackers stuffed to the gills with AI plays may fall more significantly than Train/Smith – making the active plays ironically but temporarily the low volatily choice. On a somewhat different note I would be really interested in Monevators opinions on Cedebergs July 2025 paper “Beyond the Status Quo A critical assessment of lifestyle investment advice”. Also any comments on Morningstar’s paper “The state of retirement income for 2026” that outlines alternatives to the fixed withdrawal rate e.g guardrails approach would be very welcome. So the Trump administration has fully escalated the battle with the Fed. Its going to be a long week Nassim Nicholas Taleb recounted the time he worked as a trader for some large bank in New York, and at the weekly team meeting, he was asked for his view on whether the market would rise or fall in the coming week. He replied that he expected the market to rise, on balance of probabilities, as it had done for many weeks. One of his colleagues “called him out” (or whatever this kind of misbehaviour was called in the 1980s), demanding to know why Taleb held a short position in the market, if he believed that it would rise in the coming week. Taleb calmly repeated his stated position that the market was likely to rise over the coming week, but if it didn’t, then it would fall a long way, and then he would profit handsomely. Many investors are asking the wrong question (“will the market rise over the next week?”), rather than looking at how to make rich returns from other people’s preference for steady return. It might be a good time to buy some call options on Iranian equities. Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: The Tech Layoff Crisis: 245,000 Jobs Vanished in 2025—What’s Next for 2026?

The tech industry saw an estimated 245,000 jobs lost globally in 2025, with the US accounting for the majority of layoffs. Factors such as post-pandemic overhiring corrections and increased AI adoption are driving companies to reduce headcount. Every industry faces job cuts, especially in tumultuous economic times, new technologies replacing existing jobs, and so on. Unfortunately, it looks like the tech sector is experiencing global layoffs, with an estimation of nearly 245,000 jobs lost in 2025 alone. According to a recent report from RationalFX, they estimated that about 245,000 people experienced layoffs on a global scale in the tech sector in 2025. Based on their figures, the US was the most affected, with a little over 170,000 jobs lost. This accounts for approximately 69.7% of all global tech layoffs in 2025. The largest contributor to this was Intel. At the end of 2024, the company employed about 109,000 people, but it later revealed plans to drop those figures down further to 75,000 in 2025. Other tech companies also experienced similar layoffs. This includes Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, IBM, HP, and Salesforce, just to name a few. India also experienced pretty big layoffs, with an estimated 19,000 jobs lost in 2025. This was followed by Japan at a little over 11,000, Ireland, and Switzerland, rounding out the top five countries with the biggest layoffs. So, what’s happening, and why are jobs in the tech sector getting cut? There are a number of reasons. Firstly, RationalFX suggests that this is part of a post-pandemic correction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, while jobs were lost, there were a lot of jobs created as well. This is due to a rise in demand for work-from-home solutions, entertainment, food delivery, and so on. However, following the end of the pandemic, many tech companies realized they had overhired and are working towards correcting that. Another reason why we’re seeing jobs cut is because of, you guessed it, AI. AI allows users to automate and complete tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken a human hours, days, or weeks. This means that companies can dump massive reports into AI and get summaries almost instantly. They can also use it to generate reports, make predictions, and identify patterns. This makes certain positions redundant. We’re also seeing how AI can generate impressive images and videos with a few simple prompts. But this isn’t necessarily doom and gloom. Like they say, when a door closes, another opens. When smartphones were created, suddenly being an app developer became a more viable career. Thanks to social media, being a content creator is also now a career for some. We’re not sure what the future holds for jobs in the tech sector, so we’ll have to wait and see.

Radar > Topics > AI & ML The tech trends we’re watching in the new year By Julie Baron January 9, 2026 • 13 minute read We’re three years into a post-ChatGPT world, and AI remains the focal point of the tech industry. In 2025, several ongoing trends intensified: AI investment accelerated; enterprises integrated agents and workflow automation at a faster pace; and the toolscape for professionals seeking a career edge is now overwhelmingly expansive. But the jury’s still out on the ROI from the vast sums that have saturated the industry. We anticipate that 2026 will be a year of increased accountability. Expect enterprises to shift focus from experimentation to measurable business outcomes and sustainable AI costs. There are promising productivity and efficiency gains to be had in software engineering and development, operations, security, and product design, but significant challenges also persist. Bigger picture, the industry is still grappling with what AI is and where we’re headed. Is AI a worker that will take all our jobs? Is AGI imminent? Is the bubble about to burst? Economic uncertainty, layoffs, and shifting AI hiring expectations have undeniably created stark career anxiety throughout the industry. But as Tim O’Reilly pointedly argues, “AI is not taking jobs: The decisions of people deploying it are.” No one has quite figured out how to make money yet, but the organizations that succeed will do so by creating solutions that “genuinely improve. . .customers’ lives.” That won’t happen by shoehorning AI into existing workflows but by first determining where AI can actually improve upon them, then taking an “AI first” approach to developing products around these insights. As Tim O’Reilly and Mike Loukides recently explained, “At O’Reilly, we don’t believe in predicting the future. But we do believe you can see signs of the future in the present.” We’re watching a number of “possible futures taking shape.” AI will undoubtedly be integrated more deeply into industries, products, and the wider workforce in 2026 as use cases continue to be discovered and shared. Topics we’re keeping tabs on include context engineering for building more reliable, performant AI systems; LLM posttraining techniques, in particular fine-tuning as a means to build more specialized, domain-specific models; the growth of agents, as well as the protocols, like MCP, to support them; and computer vision and multimodal AI more generally to enable the development of physical/embodied AI and the creation of world models. Here are some of the other trends that are pointing the way forward. In 2025, AI was embedded in software developers’ everyday work, transforming their roles—in some cases dramatically. A multitude of AI tools are now available to create code, and workflows are undergoing a transformation shaped by new concepts including vibe coding, agentic development, context engineering, eval- and spec-driven development, and more. In 2026, we’ll see an increased focus on agents and the protocols, like MCP, that support them; new coding workflows; and the impact of AI on assisting with legacy code. But even as software development practices evolve, fundamental skills such as code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation are as vital as ever. And despite major disruption from GenAI, programming languages aren’t going anywhere. Type-safe languages like TypeScript, Java, and C# provide compile-time validation that catches AI errors before production, helping mitigate the risks of AI-generated code. Memory safety mandates will drive interest in Rust and Zig for systems programming: Major players such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have adopted Rust for critical systems, and Zig is behind Anthropic’s most recent acquisition, Bun. And Python is central to creating powerful AI and machine learning frameworks, driving complex intelligent automation that extends far beyond simple scripting. It’s also ideal for edge computing and robotics, two areas where AI is likely to make inroads in the coming year. Which AI tools programmers use matter less than how they use them. With a wide choice of tools now available in the IDE and on the command line, and new options being introduced all the time, it’s useful to focus on the skills needed to produce good code rather than focusing on the tool itself. After all, whatever tool they use, developers are ultimately responsible for the code it produces. Effectively communicating with AI models is the key to doing good work. The more background AI tools are given about a project, the better the code they generate will be. Developers have to understand both how to manage what the AI knows about their project (context engineering) and how to communicate it (prompt engineering) to get useful outputs. AI isn’t just a pair programmer; it’s an entire team of developers. Software engineers have moved beyond single coding assistants. They’re building and deploying custom agents, often within complex setups involving multi-agent scenarios, teams of coding agents, and agent swarms. But as the engineering workflow shifts from conducting AI to orchestrating AI, the fundamentals of building and maintaining good software—code review, design patterns, debugging, testing, and documentation—stay the same and will be what elevates purposeful AI-assisted code above the crowd. AI has progressed from being something architects might have to consider to something that is now essential to their work. They can use LLMs to accelerate or optimize architecture tasks; they can add AI to existing software systems or use it to modernize those systems; and they can design AI-native architectures, an approach that requires new considerations and patterns for system design. And even if they aren’t working with AI (yet), architects still need to understand how AI relates to other parts of their system and be able to communicate their decisions to stakeholders at all levels. AI-enhanced and AI-native architectures bring new considerations and patterns for system design. Event-driven models can enable AI agents to act on incoming triggers rather than fixed prompts. In 2026, evolving architectures will become more important as architects look for ways to modernize existing systems for AI. And the rise of agentic AI means architects need to stay up-to-date on emerging protocols like MCP. Many of the concerns from 2025 will carry over into the new year. Considerations such as incorporating LLMs and RAG into existing architectures, emerging architecture patterns and antipatterns specifically for AI systems, and the focus on API and data integrations elevated by MCP are critical. The fundamentals still matter. Tools and frameworks are making it possible to automate more tasks. However, to successfully leverage these capabilities to design sustainable architecture, enterprise architects must have a full command of the principles behind them: when to add an agent or a microservice, how to consider cost, how to define boundaries, and how to act on the knowledge they already have. The InfraOps space is undergoing its most significant transformation since cloud computing, as AI evolves from a workload to be managed to an active participant in managing infrastructure itself. With infrastructure sprawling across multicloud environments, edge deployments, and specialized AI accelerators, manual management is becoming nearly impossible. In 2026, the industry will keep moving toward self-healing systems and predictive observability—infrastructure that continuously optimizes itself, shifting the human role from manual maintenance to system oversight, architecture, and long-term strategy. Platform engineering makes this transformation operational, abstracting infrastructure complexity behind self-service interfaces, which lets developers deploy AI workloads, implement observability, and maintain security without deep infrastructure expertise. The best platforms will evolve into orchestration layers for autonomous systems. While fully autonomous systems remain on the horizon, the trajectory is clear. AI is becoming a primary driver of infrastructure architecture. AI-native workloads demand GPU orchestration at scale, specialized networking protocols optimized for model training and inference, and frameworks like Ray on Kubernetes that can distribute compute intelligently. Organizations are redesigning infrastructure stacks to accommodate these demands and are increasingly considering hybrid environments and alternatives to hyperscalers to power their AI workloads—“neocloud” platforms like CoreWeave, Lambda, and Vultr. AI is augmenting the work of operations teams with real-time intelligence. Organizations are turning to AIOps platforms to predict failures before they cascade, identify anomalies humans would miss, and surface optimization opportunities in telemetry data. These systems aim to amplify human judgment, giving operators superhuman pattern recognition across complex environments. AI is evolving into an autonomous operator that makes its own infrastructure decisions. Companies will implement emerging “agentic SRE” practices: systems that reason about infrastructure problems, form hypotheses about root causes, and take independent corrective action, replicating the cognitive workload that SREs perform, not just following predetermined scripts. The big story of the back half of 2025 was agents. While the groundwork has been laid, in 2026 we expect focus on the development of agentic systems to persist—and this will necessitate new tools and techniques, particularly on the data side. AI and data platforms continue to converge, with vendors like Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce releasing products to help customers build and deploy agents. Beyond agents, AI is making its influence felt across the entire data stack, as data professionals target their workflows to support enterprise AI. Significant trends include real-time analytics, enhanced data privacy and security, and the increasing use of low-code/no-code tools to democratize data access. Sustainability also remains a concern, and data professionals need to consider ESG compliance, carbon-aware tooling, and resource-optimized architectures when designing for AI workloads. Data infrastructure continues to consolidate. The consolidation trend has not only affected the modern data stack but also more traditional areas like the database space. In response, organizations are being more intentional about what kind of databases they deploy. At the same time, modern data stacks have fragmented across cloud platforms and open ecosystems, so engineers must increasingly design for interoperability. A multiple database approach is more important than ever. Vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, and Weaviate help power agentic AI—while they’re a new technology, companies are beginning to adopt vector databases more widely. DuckDB’s popularity is growing for running analytical queries. And even though it’s been around for a while, ClickHouse, an open source distributed OLAP database used for real-time analytics, has finally broken through with data professionals. The infrastructure to support autonomous agents is coming together. GitOps, observability, identity management, and zero-trust orchestration will all play key roles. And we’re following a number of new initiatives that facilitate agentic development, including AgentDB, a database designed specifically to work effectively with AI agents; Databricks’ recently announced Lakebase, a Postgres database/OLTP engine integrated within the data lakehouse; and Tiger Data’s Agentic Postgres, a database “designed from the ground up” to support agents. AI is a threat multiplier—59% of tech professionals cited AI-driven cyberthreats as their biggest concern in a recent survey. In response, the cybersecurity analyst role is shifting from low-level human-in-the-loop tasks to complex threat hunting, AI governance, advanced data analysis and coding, and human-AI teaming oversight. But addressing AI-generated threats will also require a fundamental transformation in defensive strategy and skill acquisition—and the sooner it happens, the better. Security professionals now have to defend a broader attack surface. The proliferation of AI agents expands the attack surface. Security tools must evolve to protect it. Implementing zero trust for machine identities is a smart opening move to mitigate sprawl and nonhuman traffic. Security professionals must also harden their AI systems against common threats such as prompt injection and model manipulation. Organizations are struggling with governance and compliance. Striking a balance between data utility and vulnerability requires adherence to data governance best practices (e.g., least privilege). Government agencies, industry and professional groups, and technology companies are developing a range of AI governance frameworks to help guide organizations, but it’s up to companies to translate these technical governance frameworks into board-level risk decisions and actionable policy controls. The security operations center (SOC) is evolving. The velocity and scale of AI-driven attacks can overwhelm traditional SIEM/SOAR solutions. Expect increased adoption of agentic SOC—a system of specialized, coordinated AI agents for triage and response. This shifts the focus of the SOC analyst from reactive alert triage to proactive threat hunting, complex analysis, and AI system oversight. Business focus in 2025 shifted from scattered AI experiments to the challenge of building defensible, AI-native businesses. Next year we’re likely to see product teams moving from proof of concept to proof of value. One thing to look for: Design and product responsibilities may consolidate under a “product builder”—a full stack generalist in product, design, and engineering who can rapidly build, validate, and launch new products. Companies are currently hiring for this role, although few people actually possess the full skill set at the moment. But regardless of whether product builders become ascendant, product folks in 2026 and beyond will need the ability to combine product validation, good-enough engineering, and rapid design, all enabled by AI as a core accelerator. We’re already seeing the “product manager” role becoming more technical as AI spreads throughout the product development process. Nearly all PMs use AI, but they’ll increasingly employ purpose-built AI workflows for research, user-testing, data analysis, and prototyping. Companies need to bridge the AI product strategy gap. Most companies have moved past simple AI experiments but are now facing a strategic crisis. Their existing product playbooks (how to size markets, roadmapping, UX) weren’t designed for AI-native products. Organizations must develop clear frameworks for building a portfolio of differentiated AI products, managing new risks, and creating sustainable value. AI product evaluation is now mission-critical. As AI becomes a core product component and strategy matures, rigorous evaluation is the key to turning products that are good on paper into those that are great in production. Teams should start by defining what “good” means for their specific context, then build reliable evals for models, agents, and conversational UIs to ensure they’re hitting that target. Design’s new frontier is conversations and interactions. Generative AI has pushed user experience beyond static screens into probabilistic new multimodal territory. This means a harder shift toward designing nonlinear, conversational systems, including AI agents. In 2026, we’re likely to see increased demand for AI conversational designers and AI interaction designers to devise conversation flows for chatbots and even design a model’s behavior and personality. While big questions about AI remain unanswered, the best way to plan for uncertainty is to consider the real value you can create for your users and for your teams themselves right now. The tools will improve, as they always do, and the strategies to use them will grow more complex. Being deeply versed in the core knowledge of your area of expertise gives you the foundation you’ll need to take advantage of these quickly evolving technologies—and ensure that whatever you create will be built on bedrock, not shaky ground.

2026 is just getting started, and layoffs are already underway. Companies, including Angi, the company formerly known as Angie's List, and the popular web tool Tailwind, have cut staff, citing the impact of artificial intelligence among the reasons for the layoffs. More than 100 other companies, from Amazon to Nike to Verizon, have filed legally mandated WARN notices about job cuts to come in 2026, according to WARN Tracker. Some of the cuts are part of previously announced reductions. This year's cuts follow three years of significant workforce reductions across a broad range of industries, including tech, media, finance, and retail. The moves come as artificial intelligence, public policy, and broader economic conditions present sweeping changes to the business landscape. A World Economic Forum survey last year found that some 41% of companies worldwide expected to reduce their workforces in the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. The survey also found that jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030. Last year, Business Insider tracked layoffs at around 65 major companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Paramount, and Starbucks. In 2026, we'll continue to track additional job cuts based on company announcements, WARN notices, and our own reporting. Here are the companies with job cuts underway in 2026, listed in alphabetical order. Angi, the popular contractor listing site once known as Angie's List, said in January that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In a January 7 SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Tailwind, a popular web tool, said it cut three of its four engineers in January, citing an AI-driven decline in revenue. "75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business," CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment on January 6 that made waves in the tech community.

Title: Why Experience Innovation Is The New Brand Moat

Time Published: 2026-01-09T02:26:34Z

NEW THINKING In December 2024, Omnicom merged with IPG, eliminating approximately 4,000 jobs. Among those displaced were hundreds of brand strategists who had spent their entire careers honing the art of positioning, differentiation, and cultural resonance. They didn’t lose their jobs because they weren’t talented or dedicated. They lost them because the infrastructure they relied on—the promise-making apparatus of the advertising age—collapsed from obsolescence. This wasn’t a cyclical downturn. It was structural. And understanding why requires an understanding of how brands have fundamentally changed the way they create value for their owners and the customers they serve. This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter. Join the world’s smartest marketers and subscribe here for actionable insights delivered directly to your inbox. The Shift Everyone Saw Coming (But Was Still Surprised By) For more than a century, the brand-building playbook was remarkably consistent: Make a promise. Tell it beautifully. Repeat until it sticks. Sneaker companies promised athletic identity. Banks promised security and partnership. Consumer brands competed on who could craft the most compelling story about what their product meant, not what it could actually do for you beyond its basic function. This made sense given the constraints of the era. A sneaker company couldn’t actually make you a better athlete—but it could make you feel like one. A bank couldn’t simplify the genuine complexity of personal finance—but it could promise you’d feel confident and secure. So an entire industry architecture evolved around this model: Agencies optimized persuasion. Research measured perception. Media delivered reach. Success meant winning the battle for attention and preference through superior creative execution and bigger media budgets. Here’s what changed: That playbook just became obsolete. Not outdated—obsolete. Like a Rolodex or a fax machine or the idea that you can build a brand without actually being useful to people. And the implications are more profound than most CMOs have fully absorbed. Which is understandable—it’s hard to notice the ground shifting when you’re standing on it. Three Technology Shifts That Ended the Promise Era Three technological capabilities emerged that fundamentally eliminated the constraints that made promise-based branding necessary: First, brands can now deliver contextual utility at scale. Connectivity, sensors, and AI enable brands to understand individual contexts in real-time and orchestrate genuinely personalized responses. Nike doesn’t just promise athletic identity anymore—it delivers adaptive training programs, biomechanical feedback, and performance optimization through Training Club. Capital One doesn’t promise financial confidence—it delivers real-time spending insights, instant fraud alerts, and automated savings tools. The promise has become operationalizable in ways that were simply impossible a decade ago. Second, consumer expectations shifted irreversibly. People now expect brands to be useful, not just meaningful. A 2024 Edelman study found that 67% of consumers define brand trust primarily through “helping me solve problems” rather than “sharing my values”—a complete inversion from 2015 when values alignment dominated. Cultural resonance still matters, but it’s become table stakes rather than differentiation. Amazon’s cultural salience is near zero, yet it maintains dominant positions because it relentlessly delivers operational value: speed, convenience, reliability, and price. Third, promise-making now creates vulnerability in transparent markets. Social media, review platforms, and instant information access have made gaps between promise and delivery instantly visible and permanently documented. Brands that overpromise face immediate, public accountability. There’s a reason “We’ve heard your feedback” became the most panic-inducing phrase in corporate communications. The old model—craft aspirational messaging, deliver adequate product—now generates backlash rather than loyalty. Trust gets built through consistent delivery of value, not repetition of claims. Why The Old Model Creates New Strategic Risks The promise-focused approach isn’t just less effective—it actively creates three forms of new strategic risks: Capital misallocation. Marketing budgets optimized for awareness and persuasion are generating diminishing returns. A 2023 McKinsey analysis of 200 CPG brands found that incremental media spend beyond baseline thresholds produced 0.3x ROI, while investment in what they called “experiential utilities” – apps, services, and personalization engines – generated 3.2x returns. Every dollar spent on louder promises is effectively subsidizing competitors who are building better delivery systems. Talent misalignment. The most sophisticated strategic and technical talent now gravitates toward brands that are building operational capabilities – product teams, experience designers, and data scientists—not communications roles. Agencies report 40% declines in applications from top-tier creative talent since 2019, while product-led brands like Stripe and Notion face talent surpluses. The promise model simply can’t attract the capabilities required for modern competition. Commodification risk. When multiple brands make similar promises without differentiated delivery, entire categories collapse into price competition. Consider banking: Every major institution promises ‘financial partnership’ and ‘personalized service.’ Yet 89% of consumers report experiencing no meaningful difference whatsoever. If you’ve ever tried to distinguish between Chase’s promise and Bank of America’s promise and Wells Fargo’s promise, you know exactly what I mean. They all sound like they were written by the same AI prompt: ‘Sound trustworthy but not boring, aspirational but not arrogant, personal but not creepy. Point being, the promise layer has become completely indistinguishable, forcing bank brand competition toward rate arbitrage. Meanwhile, brands with superior delivery systems, such as Chime’s instant notifications and Revolut’s multi-currency infrastructure, capture disproportionate growth despite minimal brand investment. Playing Three Games Simultaneously Here’s what I’ve learned watching brands win and lose over the past several years: They’re no longer just trying to play one simple game where the rules are known to everyone. They’re playing three different games simultaneously. There’s the game everyone knows: Products. Better ingredients, faster processors, longer battery life, and superior formulations. This is the traditional realm of functional performance where CPG and consumer tech have always competed: simple product features, tangible benefits, and superiority claims. Then there’s the game brand strategists have obsessed over for the past 20 years: Ideas. Cultural conversations about what the “good life” looks and feels like. Not just brand positioning, but participation in broader societal dialogue about meaning, identity, and values. This is where brands try to build emotional affinity, ethical identity, and cultural capital. But there’s a third game that’s fast becoming the deciding factor: Services. And I need to be specific about what I mean here, because I’m not talking about customer service. I am not referring to call centers, return policies, or post-purchase support functions. Those remain operationally important, but they’re cost centers focused on maintaining satisfaction. What I am talking about is capability delivery: Technologies, platforms, and orchestrated experiences that give customers new abilities or dramatically expand what they can accomplish with products. Sephora’s Skincredible AI skin analysis isn’t customer service fixing a problem; it’s giving customers the tools they need to choose the best products for their skin type. Nike Training Club doesn’t address product quality issues that arise after purchase; it helps its customers become better athletes. Capital One’s real-time spending insights don’t supply FAQs. They help build financial acumen. These services don’t merely satisfy their customers’ aspirations. They provide them with new abilities. And capability delivery generates a behavioral dependency that messaging simply can’t replicate. Once you’ve integrated Spotify’s algorithms into your daily routines, you don’t switch to a competitor offering better brand promises. You’ve offloaded the cognitive work of music curation to a system that knows your preferences better than you can articulate them yourself. That’s a moat built through delivered utility, not communicated meaning. The critical insight: The competitive hierarchy among these three games has completely inverted. And understanding how requires seeing the mechanism at work. How Culture Drives the Need for Services The traditional model assumed a linear progression: Products → Ideas → Communications. Build a better mousetrap, craft compelling meaning around it, and then broadcast that meaning at scale. The modern reality operates completely differently: Culture → Products → Services → Cultural Permission. Please allow me to show you how this works: Step 1: Culture elevates aspirations. Societal movements are perpetually redefining what “good living” means. Over the past decade, we’ve seen dramatic aspiration inflation across multiple dimensions: Step 2: Elevated aspirations raise the performance bar across products. These cultural shifts don’t just change what people want. They change what they expect brands to do. When culture elevates healthspan as a new well-being aspiration, food brands face pressure for clean ingredients, supplement brands need clinical validation, and fitness brands must deliver personalized optimization. The product performance threshold rises across entire categories. But here’s the critical dynamic: Product improvements alone no longer create sustainable advantage. Technology diffusion and manufacturing democratization mean functional parity arrives faster than ever. Plant-based proteins, carbon-neutral production and AI-powered personalization—these innovations spread across competitors within 18-24 months. Product superiority becomes temporary, not structural. Step 3: Services become the actual differentiation layer. Elevated cultural aspirations create expectations not just for better products, but for personalized, connected, joyful experiences of those products. This is where services (and experiences) enter as the new competitive battleground. Consider the beauty sector: Cultural conversations about inclusive beauty standards raised product expectations such as broader shade ranges, clean formulations, and dermatologist-tested ingredients. Every major brand can now meet these thresholds. Product parity is nearly complete. But Sephora dominates because it competes in the service layer: AI skin analysis, virtual try-on technology, personalized routine recommendations, community tutorials, and beauty advisor access. These services deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” experiences that elevated beauty aspirations demand. And here’s what matters most: Service delivery earns permission to shape cultural conversation. Sephora can credibly participate in defining beauty standards because it operationally delivers inclusive, personalized beauty experiences. Competitors still making promises about inclusive beauty without service infrastructure sound hollow—the gap between claim and capability is instantly visible to consumers. Step 4: The compounding loop that changes everything. Brands that build service layers don’t just differentiate. They trigger a self-reinforcing cycle: Culture elevates aspirations → Raises product and experience expectations → Brands that deliver service layer differentiate → Service delivery generates cultural credibility → Cultural credibility earns permission to shape the next cultural iteration → Strengthened cultural position attracts more users → More users generate behavioral data → Data improves service delivery → Improved services strengthen cultural authority → Culture elevates aspirations further. Brands stuck in the Products + Ideas model can’t enter this loop. They’re making cultural promises without experiential proof. Meanwhile, brands building service infrastructure compound their advantage with each cycle; cultural position strengthens operational capability, which strengthens cultural position. Why Meaning Still Matters—But Can’t Stand Alone This framework resolves what seems like a paradox: Cultural salience remains absolutely essential, but it’s now downstream from service delivery, not upstream from product marketing. Ideas are still the prize. Brands that shape cultural conversations about aspiration achieve disproportionate mindshare, loyalty, and pricing power. Nike’s cultural influence on athletic identity, Patagonia’s environmental leadership, and Apple’s creative empowerment positioning. These idea-level assets generate billions in equity value. But services have become a powerful weapon for winning in the marketplace of ideas. You can’t credibly shape cultural aspiration through messaging when competitors are delivering capability. Let me be clear: This doesn’t mean promises have no role. Brand awareness and initial consideration still require cultural presence. Consumers need to know a brand exists before they can experience its service layer. But awareness without delivered utility now creates vulnerability, not competitive advantage. A compelling brand promise gets you into the consideration set. But a compelling service determines whether you’ll win the decision and build the kind of behavioral loyalty that compounds over time. Three mechanisms explain why this shift happened: 1. Service as Cultural Credential: The New Authenticity Standard The brand services layer doesn’t replace cultural meaning. It validates it. Brands attempting to lead cultural conversations through messaging alone face immediate authenticity scrutiny in transparent markets where gaps between claims and capabilities are instantly visible. Consumers and critics ask, “What operational evidence gives you permission to speak on this topic?” The service layer provides the answer through demonstrated commitment, not stated values. Consider Patagonia. They earn permission to shape environmental conversations because their service infrastructure proves they’ve operationalized sustainability, not just marketed it. Their Worn Wear platform offers repair services and a used gear marketplace. Their supply chain transparency tools make factory data and material sourcing publicly available. Their environmental activism funding, the 1% for the Planet commitment, gets operationalized through actual donations you can track. This provides concrete evidence that environmental stewardship is structural to their business model, not performative in their advertising. When Patagonia’s leadership advocates for public lands protection or criticizes fast fashion, the service layer grants credibility. They’re not making promises about values. They’re demonstrating values through operational commitment that costs them margin, constrains their growth, and creates a competitive disadvantage in pure product comparisons. That sacrifice is what earns cultural authority. Now contrast this with the authenticity gap that undermines promise-based cultural positioning: Dove spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars on “Real Beauty” campaigns celebrating body diversity and challenging unrealistic beauty standards. Yet they delivered retail experiences and product formulations identical to competitors who made no such cultural claims. When you asked “what operational evidence supports your beauty inclusion message?” the answer was effectively “our advertising says so.” “The service layer provided no proof. The result: cultural skepticism, campaign fatigue, and minimal impact on actual beauty culture conversations despite massive investment. Meanwhile, Fenty Beauty achieved instant cultural authority in beauty inclusion with a fraction of Dove’s marketing budget. Why? Rihanna established a service infrastructure that implemented inclusivity by offering 40 foundation shades at launch, compared to the industry standard of 6-12, utilizing undertone-matching technology that catered to the full spectrum, ensuring diverse model representation across all customer touchpoints, not just in advertising, and developing products that prioritized historically underserved skin tones. The service layer granted permission to lead beauty culture conversations that Dove, despite decades of promise-based positioning and vastly larger budgets, couldn’t credibly join. This pattern is pretty consistent: Cultural salience remains the prize, but service delivery is the credential that earns entry to the competition. You can’t claim environmental leadership without circular service models. You can’t champion inclusion without operationalized accessibility. You can’t promise empowerment without capability-conferring tools. The service layer is how brands prove their cultural positioning is authentic rather than opportunistic. And in transparent markets, that proof is a prerequisite for cultural authority. This is why the three-marketplace model places Ideas downstream from Services in the modern competitive hierarchy. Brands don’t build service capabilities to support their cultural positioning. They earn cultural positioning by building service capabilities. The causality reversed. 2. Experience as Proof: Making Abstract Aspirations Tangible Abstract aspirations become concrete through delivered experiences. “Healthspan” as a cultural aspiration remains vague until Peloton delivers personalized training that makes you measurably stronger, or until Levels provides continuous glucose monitoring that reveals how specific foods impact your energy throughout the day. The service translates aspiration into felt reality. And felt reality is infinitely more persuasive today than aspirational storytelling. 3. Behavioral Integration: Creating Mental Availability Through Utility When brands deliver utility in specific contexts, they achieve what The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute calls mental availability at Category Entry Points—the purchase moments that actually matter. Tesla famously doesn’t advertise, yet it dominates EV consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value, the Supercharger network, over-the-air updates, and autopilot capability are in the exact moments relevant to EV purchase decisions. The service delivery is the marketing, creating situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate. The Pattern of Competitive Displacement The three-marketplace framework reveals why incumbents with superior product heritage and decades of cultural equity are losing to service-first challengers. Again, allow me to show you the pattern I’ve seen everywhere in my work and research: Traditional Banking vs. Chime/Revolut Incumbents compete on Products (marginally better rates) plus Ideas (trust and partnership messaging). Challengers compete on services: instant notifications, fee elimination, multi-currency infrastructure, and automated savings. Despite zero brand equity, service-first challengers capture disproportionate growth because they deliver the “personalized, connected, joyful” financial experience that elevated money-management aspirations demand. Traditional Retail vs. Amazon Department stores maintained superior product curation and cultural positioning; lifestyle aspiration and promises of personal service. Amazon built service infrastructure: 1-click ordering, Prime shipping, personalized recommendations, and Alexa integration. Amazon’s cultural salience is minimal, yet it dominates because service delivery creates behavioral lock-in that messaging can’t overcome. Traditional Beauty vs. Sephora Legacy brands owned a stronger product heritage. L’Oréal formulations and Estée Lauder brand prestige and cultural equity were built through decades of advertising investment. Sephora invested in the service layer: virtual try-on, skin analysis, its Beauty Insider community, and personalized routines. Now Sephora shapes beauty culture conversations despite having weaker product IP. Service delivery earned cultural permission that heritage brands assumed was permanent. Traditional Eyewear vs. Warby Parker This same pattern extends beyond tech giants to mid-market challengers in commodity categories. Everyone knows this story by now. Warby Parker entered a mature eyewear market dominated by Luxottica’s brands (Ray-Ban, Oakley, and LensCrafters), which had superior product heritage, widespread retail presence, and a design legacy spanning 50+ years. Warby couldn’t win on lens technology. Prescription optics are scientifically standardized. They couldn’t win on frame design alone because fashion cycles move too fast for sustainable differentiation there. They won by competing in the service layer: Home Try-On, which ships five frames free for customer testing; Virtual Try-On technology using AR-based fit visualization; prescription renewal reminders; streamlined insurance integration; and Vision for All, which is its social impact program delivering donated glasses. These services delivered the “personalized, convenient, socially conscious” eyewear experience that elevated consumer aspirations demanded. Aspirations that Luxottica’s promise-based marketing through celebrity endorsements and fashion advertising couldn’t satisfy operationally. The result: Warby Parker achieved $500M+ revenue and market-leading satisfaction scores despite competing against brands with 50+ years of cultural equity and 100x their marketing budget. Service delivery earned cultural permission. Warby Parker now shapes conversations about accessible, responsible, stylish eyewear that incumbent brands can’t easily defend against. Their product was comparable. Their experience layer created an asymmetric advantage. The pattern holds across categories, even B2B: Service infrastructure beats cultural promise when aspirations have elevated beyond what products alone can deliver. How Service Delivery Creates Compounding Advantage Brands that architect service delivery systems rather than communication strategies build three forms of advantage that compound over time: 1. How Services Create Dozens of Moments Where Your Brand Matters Here’s something that becomes clear when you study what’s actually working: When you deliver utility through services, you’re not just strengthening the moments where people already think about your brand. You’re multiplying the number of moments where your brand comes to mind in the first place. Traditional brands compete for mental real estate at a handful of purchase occasions. Nike shows up when someone thinks, “I need running shoes.” Gatorade comes to mind at “I’m thirsty after my workout.” These are discrete, infrequent moments, maybe once or twice a year, where brand awareness determines which product ends up in the shopping cart. But watch what happens when Nike builds Training Club. Suddenly, Nike becomes mentally available at entirely different moments: “I’m starting my morning workout.” “I need motivation to actually exercise today.” “I want to track whether I’m making progress.” “I’m planning my fitness routine for the week.” “I’m recovering from an injury and need modified exercises.” “I’m training for my first 10K.” Each of these situations creates a new trigger point where Nike comes to mind—not because someone saw an ad recently, but because Nike’s service delivers utility in that specific context. They’ve gone from owning 2-3 purchase moments to being present across 15-20 behavioral moments in someone’s life. Promise-based competitors are still fighting for the same old purchase occasions with louder messaging and bigger media budgets. Meanwhile, service-delivering brands have quietly embedded themselves into dozens of daily situations through integrated utility. The compounding advantage works like this: When someone finally forms purchase intent – when they actually need new running shoes – the brand that’s been useful across twenty different moments wins consideration automatically. Not because their last ad was more memorable, but because they’ve built mental availability through delivered value across multiple contexts in that person’s life. And here’s what makes this a real moat: These aren’t just awareness touchpoints and memory structures. They’re habit formation moments. Changing someone’s opinion about a brand is relatively straightforward. A competitor’s advertising campaign can shift preference in a few months. But changing someone’s embedded daily routines? That’s extraordinarily difficult. Once Tesla’s Supercharger network becomes part of how you plan road trips, once Peloton’s 6am class becomes non-negotiable in your morning routine, and once Spotify’s Discover Weekly feels like it knows you better than you know yourself, switching to a competitor means disrupting established behavioral patterns. That friction protects market position far more effectively than emotional brand attachment alone. As I’ve already said, Tesla doesn’t run ads, yet they dominate electric vehicle consideration. Why? Because they deliver measurable value at every moment that matters for EV ownership: route planning through Supercharger network locations, managing charging anxiety through fast infrastructure, receiving software updates over-the-air, optimizing performance through autopilot capability, and protecting resale value through battery warranty programs. The service delivery is the marketing. They’ve created situational presence that pure messaging can’t replicate—and competitors can’t disrupt by outspending them on Super Bowl spots. The contrast is stark: Traditional brands spend millions fighting for 2-3 moments of consideration. Service-first brands invest their capital in building capabilities that create 15-20 moments of integration. One approach buys temporary awareness. The other builds behavioral dependency. That’s not a better marketing strategy. That’s a different category of competitive advantage entirely. 2. Learning That Compounds: Why Brand Services Improve 10-20x Faster Promise-based brands study consumers. Service-based brands learn from them. This distinction creates a structural advantage in speed-to-market fit that compounds over time. Traditional brands optimize through episodic research cycles: Conduct focus groups to understand preferences. Analyze survey data to identify unmet needs. Test campaign concepts to predict resonance. Measure post-launch performance to assess effectiveness. Adjust messaging for the next iteration. This cycle takes 6-12 months minimum, often longer for complex categories. By the time a brand has learned whether a message resonates and has deployed adjusted creative, market conditions have shifted, cultural moments have passed, and competitors have moved. Branded services and experiences are optimized through continuous behavioral feedback: Every interaction that delivers value generates data about actual usage patterns, contextual preferences, and revealed priorities, not stated intentions. Algorithms process this data in real time, not quarterly. Improvements deploy daily or hourly, not annually. Spotify doesn’t survey users about music preferences every six months. It processes 500+ million listening sessions per day and continuously adjusts recommendations. Netflix doesn’t run focus groups about content preferences. It analyzes billions of viewing decisions and uses those signals to inform content production and personalization engines. This compression of learning cycles means service-delivering brands achieve product-market fit 10-20x faster than research-dependent competitors. A service feature that isn’t creating engagement can be identified within days and modified within weeks. A messaging campaign that isn’t driving awareness requires months to measure and quarters to adjust. The velocity difference is structural, not tactical. More importantly, the learning compounds exponentially through a self-reinforcing cycle: Better service attracts more users → More users generate more behavioral data → More data enables algorithmic improvement → Improved algorithms deliver better service → Better service attracts more users. Each cycle strengthens the next, creating what people in tech call data network effects. Promise-based brands can’t enter this compounding loop because they’re optimizing communications about value, not capabilities that deliver it. You can’t A/B test your way to delivered utility. You can’t survey your way to behavioral integration. You can’t focus-group your way to capability conferral. Optimization happens through usage, which requires operational infrastructure that messaging-focused organizations don’t build and that agency partners can’t provide. Sephora’s beauty advisor recommendations improve with every skin analysis completed, every product review submitted, and every purchase made. The system learns which advice generates satisfaction and which creates returns. This learning is specific, behavioral, and continuous, creating service quality that manual consultation or static product knowledge can’t match. Competitors can copy Sephora’s service concept. But they can’t copy the years of behavioral learning embedded in the algorithms. The data moat is as defensible as the experiential moat. 3. Cultural Authority Through Demonstrated Values Brands that operationalize cultural aspirations through service delivery achieve authentic cultural presence without performative messaging. IKEA is an excellent case in point. The company’s commitment to sustainability is important to the culture because it’s built into the way they do business. For example, their Furniture Buyback program pays customers for used items, their refurbishment workshops fix and resell returned items, and their spare parts marketplace extends the life of products. These aren’t marketing claims—they’re measurable service systems customers can use. When brands demonstrate values through capability delivery, they earn cultural authority. When they merely state values through communications, they invite skepticism. The Strategic Imperative—And the Infrastructure Problem The shift from promise to delivery represents a categorical transformation in how brands create competitive advantage through customer value creation. The three-marketplace model reveals the mechanism: Culture elevates aspirations → Products must meet raised bars but quickly commoditize → Services differentiate by delivering elevated experiences → Service delivery earns cultural permission → Cultural authority compounds operational advantage. Technology eliminated the excuse for gaps between aspiration and reality. Consumers recalibrated expectations accordingly. But here’s the strategic tension most brand leaders haven’t fully confronted yet: When brands shift from making cheap promises to expensive experience innovation, the cost of guessing wrong increases dramatically. A failed advertising campaign costs media dollars and creative agency fees—painful, but contained. The brand survives. You regroup, test new messaging, and try again next quarter. Campaign failure is recoverable. A failed service platform costs engineering years, operational integration complexity, and customer trust. When you’ve asked customers to change behavior, integrate your service into their routines, share personal data, and invest time learning your interface, and then you deprecate that service, deliver broken experiences, or pivot strategy, leaving them stranded, you don’t just lose the financial investment. You lose permission. And unlike a cheesy Super Bowl ad that everyone forgets by February, a broken service or a poor experience is the kind of betrayal that still gets mentioned in a Reddit thread five years later. ‘Remember when Brand X launched that thing and it just… stopped working? Yep, never trusting them again. Brands that waste people’s time or betray their trust through incompetent execution don’t often get a second chance from their customers. Service failures create lasting brand damage that messaging can’t easily repair. This asymmetry creates a new imperative: Brand strategy can no longer afford to run on creative intuition, historical precedent, and post-launch measurement. The decision-making infrastructure that served the promise era is fundamentally inadequate for the capability era. A Clear Gap in Our Brand-Building Infrastructure The tools that most CMOs currently rely on, such as focus groups, brand tracking studies, campaign pre-testing, message recall metrics, and annual strategy planning cycles, were engineered for a world where: This infrastructure can’t support the new capability era, where The New Capabilities We Need For Experience Innovation CMOs investing in experience innovation need analytical infrastructure that can: → Simulate how cultural communities will respond before launching service platforms: Will this capability feel valuable or intrusive to target segments? Does it align with their elevated aspirations or violate their expectations for brand behavior? Which cultural communities will embrace it versus reject it? → Model which service touchpoints create sustainable habits versus one-time engagement: How many different life contexts must the service serve to achieve meaningful mental availability? What’s the threshold for behavioral lock-in that creates real switching costs? → Predict how quickly usage data will improve service quality: What volume of users is required to generate meaningful learning? At what point do the data advantages create defensible competitive moats versus remaining replicable by well-funded competitors? → Test whether proposed experiences actually deliver the elevated, personalized, joyful experiences that current cultural aspirations demand: Or will they feel transactional, generic, and friction-filled, failing to meet the raised performance bar that culture has established? → Assess operational feasibility and integration complexity: What organizational capabilities, technology infrastructure, and partnership ecosystems are required to deliver this service reliably at scale? Where are the execution risks that could turn a theoretically strong service into a practically broken experience? Current brand management tools still operate on unreasonably long timescales and fuzzy data types, such as stated preferences from surveys, recall metrics from tracking studies, and claimed behaviors from focus groups. All of these are fundamentally mismatched to service platform decisions. When you’re committing engineering years and operational integration to a capability that customers will depend on daily, you can’t afford to “test and learn” after launch. The cost of learning through failure is too high. Customer patience for broken experiences is too low. The competitive window for establishing behavioral advantages closes too quickly. The gap between what brand strategy now requires and what current analytical infrastructure provides has never been wider. Closing that gap – building decision-making tools adequate to the risks, speed, and complexity of experience innovation – is perhaps the most urgent infrastructure challenge facing marketing organizations today. The strategists who master this new discipline won’t just help brands avoid expensive mistakes. They’ll help brands simulate, test, and optimize service strategies in low-risk environments before committing capital to high-risk deployment. They’ll compress the learning cycle from years to weeks. They’ll turn experience innovation from a leap of faith into a calculated investment with predictable returns. That capability doesn’t exist at scale yet. Which means the professionals who build it will define the next era of brand strategy practice. The Human Cost—And the Professional Opportunity Remember the hundreds of strategists who lost their jobs in December? This is what this shift means for them—and frankly anyone navigating the future of brand building today. This isn’t just theoretical. It’s deeply personal for thousands of talented people right now. The market for traditional brand strategy work is contracting. Not cyclically, but structurally. When brands realize that incremental media spend produces 0.3x ROI while experience infrastructure generates 3.2x returns, they don’t just shift budgets—they shift what kind of expertise they actually need. The demand signal moves from “help us craft better messages” to “help us architect better value delivery.” This creates profound professional displacement. Strategists trained in cultural semiotics, brand positioning frameworks, and campaign development find their core skills misaligned with what clients now require. The anxiety in the strategy community is real and entirely justified. Careers that seemed secure—trajectories pointing toward Chief Strategy Officer roles, agency leadership, and independent consulting—suddenly feel precarious. But I want to be clear about something: This displacement isn’t the death of brand strategy. It’s the genesis of something more valuable. The shift from promise to delivery doesn’t eliminate the need for strategic thinking; it elevates it. The questions become harder, the stakes become higher, and the impact becomes more measurable: Old question: How do we position our brand to resonate culturally? New question: What service capabilities must we build to earn permission to shape cultural conversations? Old question: What message will differentiate us from competitors? New question: What delivered experiences will create behavioral advantages that messaging can’t overcome? Old question: How do we communicate our values authentically? New question: What operational systems will demonstrate our values through capability delivery? These new questions aren’t easy to answer. They require strategic rigor plus an understanding of technology enablement, operational feasibility, data architecture, and service design. They demand strategists who can operate at the intersection of culture, capability, and customer value—not just at the intersection of culture, creativity, and communications. I firmly believe this is the future of brand strategy work: helping companies build value-delivery systems that earn cultural authority rather than crafting communications that try to cheat it. The opportunity space is vast: These aren’t incremental evolutions of existing roles. They’re new disciplines that don’t yet have established career paths, educational pipelines, or professional associations. Which means: The strategists who master this transition will define the next era of our profession. For many strategy professionals, the recent layoffs feel like a hopeless ending. And for too many careers, they will be. But for strategists willing to evolve from promise architects to value delivery shapers, this moment represents the most significant professional opportunity of our era. The old guard is collapsing. The new infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. And yet, the brands that will dominate the next decade desperately need strategic guidance on how to make this transition without destroying operational efficiency or customer trust in the process. The uncertainty you’re feeling isn’t the absence of a future. It’s the absence of a defined future. Someone will define it. The question is whether displaced strategists will lead that redefinition effort or wait for engineers to do it for them. And trust me—you don’t want engineers defining what ‘cultural salience’ means.

Title: Amazon demands proof of productivity from employees, asking for list of accomplishments
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/08/amazon-demands-proof-of-productivity-from-employees-asking-for-list-of-accomplishments/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T18:33:03Z

Internal documents reveal that Amazon is asking its corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work, according to people familiar with the matter and an internal guideline obtained by Business Insider. Employees must provide specific examples of what they delivered to the company, along with actions they plan to take in order to continue growing at the company. “Accomplishments are specific projects, goals, initiatives, or process improvements that show the impact of your work,” the internal guideline specified. “Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn’t lead to the results you hoped for.” The performance review process, known internally as Forte, helps the company determine future pay. The new performance standards mark a break from previous reviews, according to people familiar with the matter, placing greater emphasis on individual accomplishments than in recent years. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million globally, with most of its corporate employees subject to the performance review process. Past Amazon reviews have placed less emphasis on productivity, instead asking employees about their areas of interest and strengths, posing questions like “When you’re at your best, how do you contribute?” To be sure, productivity is a common metric measured in corporate performance reviews. Productivity, along with goal progress, strengths and attendance are common talking points of corporate performance reviews. And an updated performance review does not indicate that Amazon plans to conduct layoffs. Yet Amazon’s performance review models standards around employee discipline that have become commonplace throughout the tech industry in recent years. After taking over X (formerly Twitter) in 2022, Elon Musk demanded Twitter employees explain what they accomplished each week, a tactic he brought to the federal government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency last year. CBS News chief Bari Weiss asked her staff to describe their jobs to her when she took over in October 2025, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. The review shift matches similar changes made at Amazon since Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos as CEO. In September 2024, the company initiated a return-to-office requirement for corporate employees and, in May 2025, altered compensation to better reward the highest performers. Documents leaked in 2022 revealed a peek into the company’s review process. In the documents, Amazon bosses were instructed to gauge an employee’s “overall value” by evaluating two metrics: their performance score and the potential they had exhibited. The tech giant has also reshaped its workforce through layoffs. In October, the company laid off 14,000 corporate employees amid broader AI investments. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is bullish on emerging AI technologies and has sought aggressive cost-cutting measures for the company since starting in the role. Last June, Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that “AI agents will change how we all work and live,” defining agents as “teammates” that will help employees “focus less on rote work.” And in July, Jassy told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that AI would fundamentally reshape Amazon’s workforce, automating menial work while creating new opportunities in advanced technology. However, Jassy says that the corporate layoffs had nothing to do with AI development or cutting costs, pointing instead to a mismatched cultural fit. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said. “It’s culture.” Amazon is placing its bets on AI, announcing in July an additional $100 million investment in AWS generative AI, as well as $50 billion in investments to expand AI and supercomputing infrastructure for government agencies.

Title: Slightly more Americans file for jobless benefits in the last week of 2025, but layoffs remain low
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/08/unemployment-last-week-2025/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T17:20:15Z

By MATT OTT WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. filings for jobless benefits rose in the last week of 2025 but remain historically low, despite signs that the labor market is weakening. The number of Americans filing for jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 3 rose by 8,000 to 208,000, up from 200,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was right in line with what analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6%, the highest since 2021.

By MATT OTT WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. filings for jobless benefits rose in the last week of 2025 but remain historically low, despite signs that the labor market is weakening. The number of Americans filing for jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 3 rose by 8,000 to 208,000, up from 200,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was right in line with what analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. The government’s December jobs report will be released Friday, with analysts expecting that the U.S. added 55,000 non-farm jobs. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October.

Angi said Wednesday that it was cutting around 350 jobs "to reduce operating expenses and optimize the organizational structure in support of long-term growth." The company also said it's making the cuts "in light of AI-driven efficiency improvements." In an SEC filing, Angi said that the cuts would save between $70 million and $80 million in annual spending. The layoffs will cost the company between $22 million and $30 million, according to the filing. Angie's List got its start in the 1990s as a database to help homeowners find contractors for projects such as home improvement and lawn care. The company, which rebranded in 2021 as Angi, had about 2,800 employees at the end of 2024, according to its latest annual filing. Executives at tech companies from Amazon to Salesforce have said that they are replacing at least some human workers with AI in recent months. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist known as "the godfather of AI," predicted that job losses from AI will claim even more jobs in 2026. Jump to

Title: Shoulda Called It ‘Omni-scient’; Google’s Core Tremors

Omnicom’s Omnipotence Publicis has had a nice run. But is 2026 the year of the Omnicom? On Wednesday, Omnicom announced what it calls the next generation of Omni, its central identity and analytics service. The new Omni, which integrates data and technology beneath the Omnicom umbrella, underscores the broader industry trend toward consolidation. The upgrade stems in part from Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group, which closed in November, making Omnicom the largest agency holding company by revenue. The deal also brought valuable assets into the fold, chief among them the Acxiom Real ID, an IPG-owned identity solution that is now a part of Omni. Omnicom is also leaning harder into Flywheel (acquired in 2024) to power Omni’s shopper intelligence. And, on top of that, the new Omni product comes with a new agentic AI framework (because of course). The final pillar of the new and improved Omni is Interact, which was also IPG’s name for essentially the same centralized data and analytics service. So what’s the message here for agency holdcos? It doesn’t hurt to be holding a lot of co’s. Core Workout Google Search rolled out a broad core update in December, its first since last June. Such updates typically happen a few times per year, so Google was due. SEO consultant Glenn Gabe breaks down the data from Google’s latest update in a blog post. First, some spammy redirect sites unexpectedly thrived thanks to the new update. Google has regular minor core updates to fix mistakes, Gabe writes, “but it’s interesting to see this happen with major updates focused on quality.” And the December update ignored blatant shameless efforts to improve rankings in AI chatbot searches. One cringeworthy example is to publish listicles that prominently feature your own brand. “It’s a cheesy tactic, and sort of embarrassing for companies doing that, but it works (at least for now),” Gabe writes. Reddit, meanwhile, continues to feast on Google’s AI search overhaul. This time, it’s using Google’s language-translation AI to connect its non-English user base with Google Search results. Google’s broad core update from last April and others before it boosted Reddit as a scaled source of authentic commentary and product reviews. At the same time, and unrelatedly (*wink*), Reddit signed a series of advantageous-to-Google data-sharing and advertising partnerships. Primed For Déjà Vu Recurring ads have become an unfortunate staple of the streaming experience. In more Omnicom news, Omnicom Media announced an effort during CES to address TV’s frequency problem, Digiday reports. To help buyers better understand the connection between frequency and conversions, the holdco is integrating TV viewing data from Roku, audience data from Acxiom and shopper insights from Amazon Ads within its Omni platform. Good plan. But TV’s frequency problem has stumped the ad industry for years. Remember when FreeWheel launched a Viewer Experience Lab in 2023 to try and nail the balance between ad frequency and viewer aversion? Well, it’s still far from a perfect science. Key to Omnicom’s efforts is reducing how long it takes for advertisers to see frequency impact reporting from months down to just a day or two. And Acxiom, now part of Omnicom post-IPG merger, could also help the holdco by strengthening its closed-loop attribution, which would help cut down on ad waste. For now, though, ad-supported streamers can only hope for some relief from the ad bombardment. But Wait!

Title: Xbox in 2026 — What to expect from Team Green this year, and beyond

It's an interesting, and potentially pivotal year for Xbox in 2026. After a somewhat unprecedented year of negative headlines, Xbox has an opportunity to turn it around this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's Xbox's 25th anniversary this year, and it's starting on a bit of a sour note for many. And really, it shouldn't be. Xbox had a fantastic 2025 on paper. Xbox first party shipped more games than ever. Xbox Game Pass arguably had its best sprint of high-quality games ever too, with Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Oblivion Remake, and many more hitting the service. We also saw a huge Xbox partnership with ASUS for the Xbox Ally gaming handheld, which puts Xbox Play Anywhere at the forefront. Microsoft also announced a big partnership with AMD for next-gen consoles ... alas. That's not what Xbox's 2025 will be remembered for, sadly. Microsoft has been working overtime to sink its image, injecting AI slop into every product it has, laying off thousands while bragging about how much of its code is written by AI, and hiking prices of products to uncomfortable levels. Xbox Game Pass picked up a 50% price hike on the highest tier, and Xbox Series X|S hardware has become prohibitively expensive, leading to free-fall sales declines. The drama led to a barrage of headlines questioning whether or not Xbox would even still exist to see its big 25th anniversary, slated for November 15, 2026. I suspect Xbox will want to put the negativity of the past year firmly behind itself, but it finds itself in a confluence of challenges both internal and external. The storm will pass for the vast majority of Xbox gamers unnoticed most likely, but for the wider audience, Xbox remains firmly under a microscope. One thing we know for certain is what to expect from Microsoft's first party in 2026. At least generally speaking. Microsoft has a lot in the chamber it can fire off potentially in the coming months, but the headliners are set: Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, Halo Campaign Evolved, and Forza Horizon 6. Microsoft often jokingly refers to the line-up as the "four horsemen" internally, representing what are arguably the four most iconic Xbox franchises. Microsoft will show off at least some of these at the January Xbox Developer_Direct show, which has become an annualized tone-setting event for Xbox's yearly line-up. While I'm not sure exactly what will be shown there this year (yet), it seems the four pillar franchises seem highly likely — although I have heard one of Microsoft's more intrepid teams may be ready to show off what it has been baking. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told this is not the case. However, we are eventually getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top. I'm told Obsidian of Grounded, The Outer Worlds, and Fallout New Vegas fame has four new projects, some big some small — Fallout co-creator Tim Cain also joined the studio a short while ago. I'm not sure if any of these projects are Fallout-related, but either way, it shows Xbox isn't taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to content. On the topic of Fallout, we are of course also eventually getting Fallout 5, which I understand to be greenlit. Bethesda's Todd Howard noted in a previous interview that Fallout is receiving a ton of investment right now. It could be a while before we see the fruits of that labor — but perhaps we could see them teased at an upcoming show. After all, 2026 marks several major "anniversaries" for Xbox and some of its subsidiaries. Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, Blizzard is having its 35th, and Bethesda is having its 40th. Microsoft and its teams are planning a variety of events and announcements to celebrate these milestones. At Blizzcon 2026, I thoroughly expect to see new expansions revealed for Diablo IV, alongside World of Warcraft's "The Last Titan." We should also get major updates for Overwatch and Hearthstone, and potentially other new mobile game reveals. There has been long-held rumors of an Overwatch mobile game on the horizon, for example, and I've heard another Warcraft mobile game project is in gestation. The headline for Blizzcon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back. For Bethesda's 40th, could we catch a glimpse at id Software's next title? It has been rumored for an incredibly long time that id could return to Quake or Hexen, now that all the rights fully exist within the Microsoft umbrella. Machine Games' is also thought to be working on a Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer title, although I've heard that Wolfenstein III is also on the cards to coincide with the upcoming Wolfenstein Amazon TV show. Perhaps some of these games will break cover at Bethesda's Quakecon event, but big reveals are often reserved for the Xbox Showcase. As usual, Xbox will hold an event in June to coincide with Summer Game Fest and the post-E3 summer marketing blitz. It's here where we should see glimpses at 2027 titles, which could include games like inXile's Clockwork Revolution, Undead Labs' State of Decay 3, Arkane's Blade, and perhaps other hitherto unknown titles. I've heard Ninja Theory's next game will be more combat-involved and interactive than Hellblade 1 and 2, while retaining the cinematic excellence the studio has come to be known for. We'll also catch a glimpse of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 undoubtedly here, with Activision eager to reconnect with fans after Black Ops 7's controversial delivery. Call of Duty will also drop onto Nintendo Switch 2 this year as well, fulfilling Microsoft's promises to regulators. There are strong rumors that Age of Empires will return with a new title in the future too, powered by Unreal Engine. And we could see more of Hideo Kojima's mysterious "OD" horror project this year. There's also plenty of unknowns. Xbox Publishing still has plenty of secret projects. Xbox's large stable of service games will doubtless get major updates this year, including Minecraft, Grounded 2, Fallout 76, Elder Scrolls Online, and the King mobile franchises. Could we see Toys for Bob's long-rumored Spyro this year? What is the mysterious and oft-overlooked Elsewhere Entertainment Xbox team working on? Perhaps we'll find out in 2026. I already wrote an article detailing what the Xbox Ally update roadmap looks like in 2026, but we should see some of those new features sooner, rather than later. Even if you're not an Xbox Ally owner, you should probably keep an eye on how development there is going — the Xbox Ally experience is essentially the next-gen Xbox experience too. I reported last year that the next Xbox will run full bore Windows, and that is still the plan. In partnership with AMD, the next Xbox will utilize the Windows 11 "Full Screen Experience" with the Xbox PC app to deliver its console interface. Microsoft is working on major updates to the Xbox PC app to accommodate this, bringing it more closely in line with what Xbox console players will expect when engaging with a device on their TV, rather than at their desk. Where it diverges with a traditional PC is in its ability to actually run games compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Microsoft announced that it's partnering with AMD to enable Xbox games on this PC-like device. Existing Xbox console users' libraries will come forward with them to the new Xbox, as Microsoft continues to commit to backward compatibility in a big way. I suspect we'll hear more at GDC 2026 about how Xbox plans to modernize its publishing practices to accommodate this new more "open" strategy. Developers shipping on Xbox PC already enjoy a more generous cut of the revenue than they do on console, but Microsoft still has a huge issue getting developers to organically support Xbox PC. Moving the platform to console will help here, but there will at least be a few years where Xbox Series X|S remains the primary development platform for most, I suspect. Microsoft has already signalled that it plans to make Xbox publishing more open and Steam-like, lifting the NDA on some of its publishing rules last year. Microsoft still has a long way to go to improve discoverability for quality Xbox games on its PC store, though. The more "open" nature of the Microsoft Store results in mountains of shovelware hitting the platform, and discovering quality titles remains oddly difficult. Improved community tools such as reviews, comments, curation, and interactivity would help improve discoverability algorithms, so hopefully we see some of those kinds of features materialize this year. I'm told we should also see some new Xbox hardware this year. I suspect we'll finally see the Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 break cover in 2026, and perhaps even other controller revisions. I'm told Microsoft's next-generation Xbox controllers all support direct-to-WiFi connectivity, eliminating Bluetooth latency from cloud gaming scenarios. There's always the chance we'll see more "Xbox" branded OEM hardware, taking advantage of the Xbox Full Screen Experience on Windows, similar to the Xbox Ally. I've been working through some credible rumors that we could see an OEM "Xbox" PC in 2026, but time will tell whether or not that one pans out. On paper, everything is looking up for Xbox as an entity, but challenges remain. Xbox Series X|S hardware sales are in free-fall decline, although existing users are sticky and remain heavily engaged. Despite PlayStation's vastly bigger install base, some games such as Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders over-index on Xbox systems, delivering disproportionate engagement for publishers. There's still a ton of money to be made on the Xbox ecosystem, which is why we haven't seen publishers pull out of the platform despite the decreased amount of new users coming in. Where Xbox is seeing success is on Xbox PC. I'm told Microsoft may begin reporting its Xbox PC stats as part of Microsoft's quarterlies, reflecting its growth. The addition of benefits in games like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant has helped Xbox PC win itself an alternative audience to that of Steam, although organic support still seems to be a challenge for titles shipping outside of Xbox Game Pass. People will continue to view Microsoft under a microscope, and for good reason. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has not been shy about the company's awkward obsession with AI technology, regardless of how well it actually performs for the end-user. "Microslop" has been trending as a result. There have already been rumors of mass Microsoft layoffs in January 2026, although I'm told these are false (at least with regards to Xbox). The DRAM price glut is something Microsoft and other companies will not be able to escape, though. Practically anything powered by a computer is likely to see price increases this year, as OpenAI and other companies buy up all the components chasing increasingly-insane compute demands. Will that further impact prices for console, PC, and even game prices? Xbox won't be the only one impacted by this macroeconomic instability, but Xbox's reputation has already been on shaky ground. There has been a ton of negativity and angst about Microsoft's direction and corporate-level commitment to gaming, and for good reason. But, I am hopeful that Xbox can fully turn a corner this year and begin to show that it, and its ecosystem, are truly here to stay.

Title: Future of TV Briefing: 5 ripple effects that will shape the future of TV in 2026

More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at the trends and developments that will shape the TV, streaming and digital video industry in 2026. No one knows how 2026 will play out. But many of the major developments this year are likely to be ripple effects precipitating from events of the past year. Here are five in particular that are most likely to dominate storylines and strategies across the TV, streaming and digital video industry in 2026. Netflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio business won’t close in 2026. But that’s unlikely to put a hold on M&A activity among major TV and streaming companies. The first question becomes what do WBD’s spurned suitors do in response? Paramount and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are unlikely to pair up given the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s broadcast ownership rules (and the U.S. government’s antagonistic relationship toward Comcast). But there are (much) smaller targets on the market: A+E Global Media, AMC Networks, Lionsgate, Starz, etc. Then there’s the much bigger question of how does Disney react? And the clarifying question — with Disney CEO Bob Iger slated to step down in 2026 — of who will oversee Disney’s reaction? Or does Disney become an acquisition target because Netflix’s attempt to acquire WBD has jolted its tech counterparts, namely Amazon and Apple, to bolster their respective streaming libraries with owned-and-operated intellectual property (and does Disney’s content licensing deal with OpenAI influence or de-influence that)? In 2025 Youtube cemented its status as the predominant media company on TV as a whole, not just streaming. The Google-owned video platform had already overtaken Netflix as the most-watched streaming service on TV screens in the U.S., and last year it leapfrogged Disney as the most-watched TV network and/or streaming service owner on TV screens in the U.S. But for as much as YouTube has propelled itself into a class of its own, it began facing new forms of competition in 2025. Netflix and Tubi, for example, inked deals with top YouTube creators to distribute the creators’ YouTube libraries on their respective streamers. They also signed deals with creators for original series, and Netflix started to go after YouTube’s video podcasting preeminence by securing exclusive distribution deals for some shows that also include pulling those shows away from YouTube. In other words, YouTube’s growth has reached a point of maturation for the creator economy. That intersection is pushing the platform’s TV and streaming competition to take its creators more seriously, and this year that may press YouTube to respond in ways that refortify its position at the center of the creator economy. Last year streaming’s share of advertisers’ annual upfront commitments inched closer to traditional TV’s portion. This year may be the one when the balance finally tips in streaming’s favor. To be clear, the overall TV ad market already tips in streaming’s favor outside the upfront. But the upfront has continued to orient around TV, if only by virtue of it really centering around live sports. But on that front, the conditions in this year’s upfront are likely to be different than last’s. This year’s upfront comes a year after ESPN and Fox introduced standalone streaming services as well as after Amazon and Peacock began airing NBA games. Also in this year’s upfront Netflix will have Major League Baseball and the Women’s World Cup on offer. And then there’s the biggest asterisk of all: when it comes to the upfront, to what extent is YouTube taken into account? I guess the other asterisk is to what extent does the upfront even matter anymore. It does matter, but not to every advertiser, especially those who can’t afford or don’t care for traditional TV inventory. Consider that ad-supported tiers growing and streaming services and connected TV platforms creating more inventory in the form of home-screen ads and increased ad loads. As a result, streaming ad prices are dropping, which will likely induce more demand for streaming inventory — especially as more of that major live sports streaming inventory is made available for sale programmatically outside the confines of an upfront agreement. On the other end of the industry spectrum is the short-form video market, and at the center of that market for years has been TikTok. But this year there will be TikTok and then TikTok U.S. Sure, legacy TikTok (i.e. ByteDance) will reportedly still be responsible for ad sales, but TikTok U.S. will effectively be a separate app — and potentially a new user experience. The look of TikTok U.S. may mirror its legacy version, but the feel will come down to its U.S. operators’ ability to replicate its content recommendation algorithm, as well as to people’s willingness to continue to use the app under its new owners. Another factor will be moves made by TikTok’s primary rivals. We’ve spent enough space talking about YouTube, but there remains the major fact that last year YouTube said Shorts generated more revenue per watch time than long-form videos, meaning YouTube has every incentive to ramp up its TikTok rival in 2026. And then there’s Instagram Reels. The Meta-owned platform’s CTV app may end up in the dustbin alongside IGTV, but it’s hard to ignore Reels’ $50 billion annual revenue run rate, especially if Instagram (and Facebook) start sharing that ad revenue with creators and publishers. The impact of AI-generated content on short-form video platforms is too big to squeeze into the previous section. Plus it’s not limited to short-form video platforms, nor is it simply a question of slop. Last year saw AI-generated video passing the “Will Smith eating spaghetti” test and receiving its own dedicated video platforms in the form of OpenAI’s Sora and Meta’s Vibes. AI-generated video can’t be confined to its own feeds, though. A sizable share of YouTube Shorts’s feeds are already being populated with AI-generated videos, as noted below in “Numbers to know.” And an increasing number of brands from Coca-Cola to Equinox are rolling out AI-generated ads. TikTok and Pinterest have introduced options to limit AI-generated content in feeds, but neither platform makes any promises about being able to entirely wipe AI-generated content from those feeds. Instagram’s Adam Mosseri seemed to acknowledge as much by saying in a recent Instagram post that “it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.” And that’s at a time when the line between real and fake media is becoming even blurrier in light of Disney’s OpenAI deal and the likelihood of more major IP owners following suit. Meanwhile, Disney is looking to incorporate AI-generated video into Disney+, and the most popular streamer on Twitch is powered by AI. For as pervasive as AI-generated video has become, so too has been the pushback against it. But there’s no pushing back the clock to a time before generative AI. While Netflix-WBD may further signal TV and streaming cycling back to the bundle, AI slop portends a new era altogether. That all this is happening at the same time only makes the outlook fuzzier. Now to see how it all comes into focus throughout the year. “If the user experience holds steady, we expect spend to fluctuate only as media buyers pause to recalibrate their data.” 30%: Estimated percentage share of Netflix’s subscriber base that is the ad-supported tier. 700 million: Number of hours that YouTube viewers, cumulatively, spent streaming podcasts through the platform’s CTV app in October. 21%: Percentage share of 500 YouTube Shorts in a sampled feed that were AI-generated videos. 26.5 million: Number of U.K. streaming subscribers who are on ad-supported tiers, versus 23.1 million who on ad-free tiers. 18%: Percentage increase in the number of layoffs for employees in the entertainment and media industry in 2025.
