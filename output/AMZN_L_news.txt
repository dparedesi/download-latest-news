Amazon layoffs just took a futuristic turn. Leaked internal documents suggest the company could replace 600,000 U.S. jobs with robots by 2027 — part of a $12.6 billion automation drive. By 2027, around 160,000 warehouse roles may vanish as machines take over picking and packing. Amazon says it’s not a mass firing — just “efficiency.” But the data paints a different story: fewer human hands, more robots, and a rapidly changing future of work. 5 Stories 7 Stories 9 Stories 9 Stories 8 Stories 6 Stories (Catch all the Technology News News, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG Krist Boo Published Oct 20, 2025, 04:14 AM Updated Oct 20, 2025, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Software engineers in Singapore are less likely than their global peers to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI), owing to strong government support and the Republic’s proximity to an array of tech firms, say talent and technology players. The rise of vibe coding – where one can build apps and websites using word commands – is especially ominous for this group of computer experts. vibe coding Mr Eugene Yang, managing director for Singapore and Hong Kong at technology consultancy Palo IT, said the signs are that companies here are already reducing demand for junior developers, traditionally hired through offshore markets such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. But Singapore’s smaller, more specialised tech workforce offers an opportunity. He said: “We could emerge as the AI orchestration hub for South-east Asia, managing AI agents rather than human coders.” Managing AI agents – bots that can work and learn independently without human supervision – to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks is beginning to draw attention among enterprises. Ms Rohini Saluja, managing director at real estate services firm CBRE, said the AI orchestration layer is where human oversight, ethical design and complex system integration are needed. These areas play up Singapore’s strengths – but offshore information technology (IT) offices will not disappear, she said. She noted: “Take an example of data labelling for AI training. Despite improvements in optical character recognition technology, companies continue to value quality, accuracy and the human lens for such data. “Such roles will not be feasible in higher-cost markets.” Likewise, Mr Ravi Nippani, head of regional industries and solutions at professional services firm Mercer Asia, expects businesses here to keep using offshore teams. These remote teams offer specialised skills and scale for large IT projects, as well as personalised customer interactions. They also help businesses spread their geographical operation risks. “Companies should not rush to cut offshore IT offices but rather consider transforming their offshore teams,” Mr Nippani advised. For instance, offshore offices could be upgraded from routine coding to higher-value tasks such as AI management, complex problem-solving and system design, he said. Singapore is home to around 4,500 tech firms, including the regional operations of major global tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Director for AI innovation at AI Singapore Laurence Liew expects firms to bring some of their overseas roles home when Singapore is able to offer enough AI workers at competitive wage levels. The Government has a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029, and is supporting it with apprenticeships, scholarships, reskilling initiatives and public-private collaborations. a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029 It has launched programmes such as the Skills Pathway for Cloud, offered by the Singapore Computer Society in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture Singapore; IMDA’s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; and AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. Skills Pathway for Cloud, Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme Mr Liew said software engineers everywhere are using AI or agentic coding tools today. AI Singapore’s apprenticeship initiative aims to give the local workforce an edge by injecting AI workers with diverse backgrounds into the economy. He said: “Not all are software or computer science graduates, which makes the programme all the more valuable, as they bring their past domain experience to solve business problems.” Almost all its trainees, ranging from fresh graduates to mid-career job switchers, are hired within six months of graduation. About six in 10 find jobs before graduation, he added. The programme will produce more than 500 graduates over 20 cohorts by the middle of 2026. While engineers here are already expected to be more productive with the help of AI coding tools, higher salaries are not in the offing for now, said Mr Ethan Ang, chief executive of tech career platform NodeFlair. “The market remains employer-driven, especially after the wave of tech layoffs, and companies generally view AI adoption as a way to improve competitiveness and efficiency, rather than as a justification for higher salary negotiations,” he said. NodeFlair estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 of the 214,000 tech workers in Singapore are software engineers and developers making a median monthly salary of $6,750. Regional director John Borneman of recruitment firm Hays expects median salaries for this group to stay flat in the next 12 months. But he expects the ones who have upskilled to command more pay. “The rise of low-code platforms is reducing the need for teams writing boilerplate code, so the more skilled you are in architecture and modelling, the greater value you will add to an organisation, and the bigger the upside for your pay packet,” he said.

Title: Hideo Kojima Says AI Is “A Friend,” Not a Threat to Creativity in Game Development
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Hideo-Kojima-Says-AI-Is-A-Friend-Not-a-Threat-to-Creativity-in-Game-Development.1141848.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-19T01:46:00Z

Hideo Kojima recently shared an optimistic view on artificial intelligence, framing it not as a threat to the games industry or to human creativity for that matter, but a collaborative “friend’ that can handle the more time-consuming aspects of game development. In a recent interview with Wired Japan, Kojima highlighted that while many in the industry use AI to generate ideas, he views it differently, stating: “A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas. But I think of AI as more of a friend… I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency.” Kojima’s perspective on the use of AI and its role in creative workflows comes amid a time when many companies like Activision, Level-5, and Capcom are using AI. A recent survey in June and July found that 32% of CESA member companies are using AI to develop in-house game engines, extend to visual game assets, generate text, and assist in programming. It’s pretty surprising how much of a foothold AI already has in gaming, considering some companies have been quite open about their use of AI in pretty much everything from visual upscaling to code generation, even as user and developer pushback continues on multiple mediums. Kojima's approach shows how AI can be used to streamline monotonous tasks such as animation, motion capture, and NPC behaviors without supplanting the core creative process in video game development. He further added in the Wired interview, saying, I’d like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower the cost and cut down on time. It’s more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead, creating together with AI. Kojima’s stance on the use of AI stands in stark contrast to the push toward full automation in some sectors, maintaining AI as a tool for efficiency rather than a complete substitute. For instance, during the development of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kojima Productions employed machine learning for scanning actors, including Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, to create digital models. While Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been praised for its high-fidelity visuals, realistic character models, and facial animations, Kojima himself views the result as merely “okay” and seeks even greater realism in future endeavors like OD and Physint. At the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh in August, he discussed a few challenges during Death Stranding 2’s production, and mentioned: We scanned and we made a rig, an AI machine learning rig. We took so much time and made sure that we scanned them into digital, but made sure that they move analog in a way. And it took so much time. Looking back, I think it’s okay. But my next project, I think I want to make it more realistic. Debates over the use of AI in the game industry continue unabated, even as it remains the leading cause for layoffs in an industry struggling to find sustained profitability. While some developers are aiming for total automation, Kojima’s vision for using AI as a co-creator could help reduce game development costs, while making sure humans remain at the helm of innovation.Buy Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on Amazon Wired - Instagram

Title: Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles leaves Rare after 36 years as he announces exit on X

Gregg Mayles, the director behind Banjo-Kazooie, has finally bid farewell to Rare after an impressive 36 years at the British studio. Mayles, who joined Rare in 1989 straight out of high school, announced his exit on X in poetic alliteration, titled “A Rather Resplendent Rewarding Rare Ramble,” fittingly referencing the rhyming dialogue that defined Banjo-Kazooie. The poem basically recounts his journey, from his early days ignoring banking for game design to contributing to hits like Battletoads, Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Viva Piñata, and Sea of Thieves, while expressing gratitude to fans and colleagues. He ended the post with the line “Now time to start new tales to tell, Farewell to Rare, he waves, farewell!” Over his tenure, Mayles worked on 30 games, helping shape Rare’s golden era during the Nintendo 64 heyday. He contributed to classics such as the 1998 platformer Banjo-Kazooie, which sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide and spawned sequels like Banjo-Tooie in 2000. He also contributed to many other beloved titles, including the 1994 beat ‘em up Battletoads, the Donkey Kong series starting with Donkey Kong Country in 1994, the 2003 Xbox horror-comedy Grabbed by the Ghoulies, the 2006 life sim Viva Pinata, and most recently, directed the live-service hit pirate adventure multiplayer game, Sea of Thieves, which launched in 2018 and has since amassed more than 40 million players across all platforms. This announcement comes amid a turbulent and dark period for Rare, following Microsoft’s acquisition of the studio in 2002 for $375 million, after which it shifted focus from Nintendo to Xbox. While Sea of Thieves stands as Rare’s most successful release, the studio had nonetheless faced many hiccups throughout the years, like 2013's Kinect Sports. Notable here is ambitious open-world adventure Everwild, whose development was being overseen by Gregg Mayles himself. The game was announced in 2019 and had been in development for over five years. However, Microsoft canceled Everwild in July 2025 as part of broader layoffs, affecting up to 9000 employees company-wide. This also included cuts at Rare and the scrapping of The Initiative's Perfect Dark Reboot, another project tied to Rare’s legacy. Sources report that the cancellation of Everwild, after nearly a decade of troubled development and multiple reboots, likely influenced Mayles' decision to leave Rare. However, he didn’t specify the reason in his post on X. Gregg Mayles - X

Title: Microsoft laid her off. A layoff support group helped her bounce back — and she got a job at Meta 2 months later.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, after 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen began to sense her time at the tech giant might be running out. Several colleagues on partner teams were among the roughly 6,000 employees laid off that month. The news made Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, worry that her group would be next. She said it eventually became the "worst-kept secret" that additional layoffs were coming, and that her team was likely to be affected. All she could do was hope to come out unscathed. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." On July 2, her fears were confirmed. Hendersen was one of about 9,000 employees laid off as part of a sweeping companywide reduction. During previous rounds of layoffs she'd survived, Hendersen said it was often hard to tell who had been let go — something the company attributed to privacy concerns. But in her view, that lack of clarity made the experience more difficult for those still at the company, who were left guessing which colleagues had suddenly disappeared. "It's just very uncomfortable, in my experience, to not know who has been affected," she said. So rather than keeping her layoff a secret, she decided to make sure her network knew about it. The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she started drafting messages to share internally and on LinkedIn. That decision didn't just bring emotional support — it also helped her land a new role at Meta two months later. Hendersen is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've been laid off over the past year. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. However, the cuts have also affected individual contributors, such as Hendersen. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Amazon, and Intel have also announced plans to shed workers. While layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a slowdown in white-collar hiring has made it harder for many to secure new roles. But in this challenging environment, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Hendersen shared how she responded to the layoff — and how she landed a job at Meta without ever applying. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Next, while she still had access to her email, she messaged colleagues on her team, letting them know she'd lost her job — and hoping to identify others affected. As people replied, she added them to a Microsoft Teams group chat. Over the next week, the group of more than a dozen people became a support hub — where laid-off employees traded tips on how to file for unemployment and make sense of the HR materials they'd received. "I would vastly have preferred that I'd have been the only person who was laid off," Hendersen said. "But the fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful." Hendersen also took steps to prepare financially. When she first suspected a layoff might be coming, she and her husband sold some of their stock holdings to ensure they had enough cash on hand. They didn't know exactly what the severance package would look like, so they wanted to be ready. Once the layoff hit, Hendersen learned she'd continue receiving paychecks through late August, followed by a lump-sum severance payment based on her years of service. With that information, she and her husband analyzed their budget, determined how far their savings would take them, and identified expenses they could cut. She said the process was stressful. "There was very much a sense of stunning anxiety," she said. By reaching out to colleagues and preparing financially, Hendersen hoped to make the transition from Microsoft a little smoother. But she wanted to take some time to decompress and get organized before beginning her job search. "It had been 15 years since I'd updated my résumé in any meaningful way," she said. "I didn't have standardized cover letters. I didn't have all the little stories prepared that you're supposed to tell about yourself in interviews." However, Hendersen said she didn't decompress quite as much as she'd intended. After posting on LinkedIn, friends and former colleagues began reaching out about job opportunities, leading to informal conversations about whether they could be a good fit for her. "It was just like this ocean of warm hugs and kindness that came from people who were here to help me," she said. Support also came from the other laid-off Microsoft colleagues she'd organized in a Teams chat. Before losing access to their internal chat, the group transitioned to Discord, where they shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Since Hendersen was finding opportunities through her network, she generally avoided the traditional application route. In total, she thinks she may have formally applied to one role. Relying on her network felt more manageable, especially since, after more than a decade out of the job market, she wasn't sure how to navigate online job searching. Typically, she would share her résumé with a connection, who would then refer her for a role. A recruiter would follow up to begin the process. In some cases, someone would flag an opening, and she'd message the recruiter directly, rather than applying online. One of the roles that was recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. Someone she knew at the company told her about the opening, which was similar to her role at Microsoft, where she'd conducted studies to evaluate how players interacted with games in development. The Meta role was under Reality Labs, the company's hardware and virtual reality division, and allowed her to work from Meta's Seattle office. Hendersen said the position seemed like a good fit, and after her connection referred her, she landed an interview. In late August, she received a job offer and started full-time in October. Hendersen said she came away from her job search with a few takeaways. First, it's important to develop a library of stories from your career that you can use in interviews. "You've done amazing things that people should be really impressed by," she said. "But can you remember them in the moment? That's so hard." She also recommends practicing how to tell those stories, especially to people who aren't in your field. When she interviewed at Meta, not everyone she spoke with came from the gaming world. That meant she had to explain her past work in a way that resonated with interviewers who didn't have the same level of expertise. Perhaps her biggest takeaway was the importance of supporting — and being supported by — others going through the same journey. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time."

Title: Black Women Leaders Found Joy And Reclaimed Their Resilience At The 2025 C-Suite Summit

ByDominique Fluker, Contributor. Black women are experiencing a reckoning. Many of us have found ourselves without a job this year due to mass layoffs, despite our capabilities and accomplishments. Throughout this year, you might’ve come across articles with the headline akin to, “350,000 Black Women Ousted From The Workforce,” highlighting the mass exodus of Black women professionals and documenting where we currently are professionally, despite the despite the grim reality many face. But what hasn’t been as explored are the resources being offered to help keep those who are still in corporate America encouraged, emotionally and spiritually—as many of colleagues, family members and broader community are looking to us for moral support, inspiration, leadership and refuge. Who do we turn to in the face of unprecedented change, confusion and heartache? Is there a soft place to land without judgment and high expectations to perform? That’s where the Martha’s Vineyard African American C-Suite Summit comes into play. Co-founder of Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, Stephanie Tavares-Rance dreamt up the idea in 2019 to create a safe, tangible space for women occupying the highest levels of leadership. The idea morphed into an anticipated event of the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in 2021, initially as a C-suite luncheon, and has since expanded to include additional cities like Los Angeles, California, Denver, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia, featuring notable guests and speakers like April Ryan; Zola Mashariki, head of Audible Studios; Latasha Gillespie, global head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Amazon Studios; award-winning actress Uzo Adubo; and ​​Nicole Avant, to name a few. In October 2024, in the C-Suite Series, the experience evolved into a confluence of women leaders at the inaugural C-Suite Summit, which convened in beautiful Beaver Creek, Colorado, for attendees to “Exhale” and embrace wellness, networking, mentorship and inspiration. In all of these spaces, attendees are encouraged to cultivate new relationships and professional possibilities while engaging in provocative and intimate discussions. This year’s summit was aptly named “Resilience,” as multitudes of Black women are finding themselves in a precarious spot regarding their emotional bandwidth, stretching themselves at work by trying to keep their roles by any means necessary, or recovering from a layoff, while also balancing the stressors of their personal lives. Held from October 9 to 12, at the luxurious Park Hyatt Aviara, in Carlsbad, California, a Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rated hotel, the summit, sponsored by Disney, L’Oreal Groupe, Carolina Herrera, Amazon MGM Studios, and ESPN, welcomed C-suite executives, entrepreneurs, A-list actresses, from across the country to convene, participate in transformative workshops, and listen to inspiring fireside chats rooted in reclaiming their resilience, while learning how to expand their professional footprint and deepen their influence and leadership skills. Beyond career strategy, the 2025 C-Suite Summit became a safe space for rest, joy, reflection, and establishing the balance in the face of professional turbulence, intentionally designed that way by Tavares-Rance and her team. From early morning Afro-Soca workouts sponsored by ESPN and hosted by Ariel Belgrave to workshops about how to reclaim resilience and position oneself for power from a health perspective, (both sessions led by chief executive officer Dr. Wizdom Powell and Dr. Kelly Elmore, GME president and OBGYN physician), the topic of the sessions showcased a need to focus on health and wellness, as a means of leverage within the workplace and beyond. Lunch-and-learn and fireside chat conversations with the likes of Vanessa Morrison, president of streaming at Walt Disney Studios, and others also proved meaningful, covering the gamut of aspirational career strategies and taking strategic leaps of faith to move forward in line with your purpose. Professional footprint and leadership skills takeaways from the workshop sessions throughtout the summit highlighted the importance of holistic healing (regulating and tending to your mind, body, and spirit) by doing activities that you once loved to do, actively receiving therapy or working with a life coach to understand previous trauma and address it, exploring ways how to bring your whole self to work, like being vulnerable and open. The sessions also guided attendees on how to regain confidence in themselves and work productively after a layoff or career shift, by encouraging them to be open to pivoting and to lean on authentic communities of support for referrals, advice, and job opportunities. Aside from purposeful discussions, the summit offered fun, joyful experiences such as rejuvenating spa sessions, yoga and an exclusive Amazon MGM screening of Hedda. As an attendee of the summit, I got a sense that Tavares-Rance designed this experience to be a safe space for Black women that went beyond the stuffy workshop sessions you may experience at corporate-based career summits and conferences; instead, she wanted to enrich and empower their spirits, especially after a turbulent and trying year. And she did. “I really believe that Black bodies deserve to be spoiled, and I wanted the summit not just to be entertainment focused, because that’s my background. I feel like as Black women, we’re just so siloed with our industries, but you never know where your next job opportunity, your next friendship, your next board position is going to come from," she tells me. "I wanted to create a space where all women from all over could come together, meet new people, be vulnerable, have a really good time, and spoil themselves with spas, hikes, and walks." Tavares-Rance shared that the goal of this summit was to let Black women know that they aren’t alone, no matter what industry they’re in. “Being a Black woman, we all go through the same challenges, and this space has let you know that you’re not alone and that we're here to help,” she says. While career growth and intentional expansion were at the center of the conference, another vital topic lingered—women’s health and self-care, which are critical to overall success and elevation in and out of the workplace. “I believe women’s health is so important, as well as our mental health. As women, we're just told to stuff down our trauma and put on our armor, go to the office, and be strong. And there's no place for us to be vulnerable. So I wanted to talk about things that matter to us at this summit,” she states. When it comes to this year’s summit title and theme, resilience, Tavares-Rance was clear about the intention: using joy as a form of resistance. “I think it's essential for us to realize that we're not alone, and our ancestors have been through much worse. I've chosen to focus on joy because I believe joy is a form of resistance. We are resilient, and the thought and the act of reclaiming our resilience has a lot to do with owning our power and our capabilities and not getting caught up in the title of your job,” she shares.

Title: Melinda Gates-backed women's health startup Tia just cut 23% of its workforce

Every time Rebecca publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Women's health startup Tia has slashed about 23% of its staff, Business Insider has learned. The company, which provides in-person and virtual care tailored to women, cut 27% of its corporate team, or 17 people; 22% of its providers, or 27 people; and 23% of its field support team, or 28 people, according to an email to employees sent Monday evening by Tia CEO Felicity Yost. Tia's layoffs show how even buzzy, well-funded startups are being forced to reckon with healthcare's economic pressures against venture capital's growth expectations. Once a rising star backed by Melinda French Gates, Tia is now under pressure to prove that its hybrid model of tech-enabled women's clinics can actually turn a profit. The demise of similar healthcare startups like former Silicon Valley darling Forward has shown how hard tech-enabled healthcare can be to scale; even Amazon owned-health clinic company One Medical has struggled with profitability. Tia confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Business Insider. Tia operates as a one-stop healthcare shop for women, providing services from gynecology and primary care to mental healthcare, with options for in-person and virtual care. The startup runs 11 clinics, according to its website, including six locations in Los Angeles, two in New York City, one in San Francisco, and two in Arizona. Yost told employees in her email that the layoffs were a response to feedback Tia received in a recent fundraise. Yost said Tia sought that funding after its business's underperformance meant Tia would not be able to reach profitability without more cash. The feedback from the fundraise "required us to rethink our business in the current economic and policy climate, which is one that prizes cost and profit-consciousness," Yost said in her email. "We must manage towards a faster timeline to be corporate-level profitable than we previously contemplated." "Tia has seen strong growth, particularly in membership, which has outpaced our expectations for 2025. At the same time, we're facing ongoing structural challenges impacting the broader care delivery sector, such as cost pressures from rising labor rates and tighter reimbursement rates, which require us to be more disciplined in our operations," a Tia spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. In-person clinics have proven difficult to sustain financially, even for well-funded healthcare companies. Forward shut down abruptly in November 2024 after raising over $650 million to scale its tech-driven clinics and automated "CarePods." Primary care chain VillageMD has begun selling its clinics after spinning off from Walgreens in the retailer's sale to Sycamore Partners in August; Walgreens had announced plans to close 160 VillageMD clinics in April 2024 to curb losses. Walmart shuttered all 51 of its health centers later in April, citing a lack of profitability. While Tia hasn't announced a round of funding since its $100 million Series B in 2021, Yost's email to employees references Tia's "Series C growth plan." Tia didn't respond to a question from Business Insider about its Series C. The startup also raised an undisclosed amount of Series B extension funding from Melinda French Gates' Pivotal Ventures in 2023, which Tia said brought its total funding to $150 million. "Across healthcare, we're seeing organizations respond to market trends that favor operational efficiency, sustainable growth, and sharper financial discipline. Tia is doing the same, and from a position of strength," the Tia spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that Tia has more health system partnerships and expansion announcements planned for early next year. Yost said in her email to employees that the fires in Los Angeles in early January had challenged Tia's business in the first quarter. She also cited "slower than necessary growth that hampered our business." Tia introduced new projects in the second quarter, "meant to counteract the dip in Q1 performance," Yost wrote. Those initiatives included a new model to allow patients to get care from Tia without becoming a member, a partnership for Tia members to access compounded GLP-1 prescriptions, and a national rollout of Tia's virtual care services. While the new no-membership-required model outperformed expectations, Yost said, underperformance across the rest of the business led Tia to seek additional funding because "we would not achieve profitability with our existing cash runway, as planned." Yost said Tia did ultimately secure additional funding, but received feedback in the process that led to the layoffs. Yost and Witte started Tia in 2016, focusing on in-person clinics. The startup began rolling out virtual care services in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later shifted to a hybrid model. Tia's last reported layoff occurred in July 2022, as Business Insider reported the following November. Tia cofounder and then-CEO Carolyn Witte told BI that the layoffs were a preemptive response to the market downturn so Tia could continue to grow responsibly. Witte stepped down as Tia's CEO in April 2024 and into the role of Tia's chairwoman. Witte said a LinkedIn post about her departure from the role that Yost, formerly Tia's president, would serve as Tia's interim CEO. A Tia spokesperson told Business Insider after publication that Witte had stepped down as board chair shortly after departing the CEO position. Yost is now Tia's permanent CEO. In addition to the layoffs, Yost said in her Monday email that Tia would make significant changes to its operating expenses, including to its tools and contracts, and cut compensation for its senior leaders. Yost also said that Tia could no longer afford to hire clinical roles ahead of demand and "must creatively rethink how we optimize our administrative and care support roles across a broader range of responsibilities." She said the startup aims to make these changes without compromising its high-quality patient care standards. Employees affected by the Tuesday layoffs, including patient-facing providers, were cut off from Tia's systems immediately following the email.

Title: Tech industry stalling as AI takes over, with junior roles cut in half

Graduate tech jobs are down 46% from last year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new report from the Institute of Student Employers (ISE) has found that the UK tech industry has experienced a 46% drop in tech graduate jobs from 2024, and a further 53% drop projected in 2026. This probably won’t come as much of a shock to many, but recent tech graduates most likely have AI to blame for the dramatic decline in jobs on offer. After all, why train a junior worker for basic digital tasks, coding, or data analysis when you could ask AI to do it? The UK isn’t the only country suffering. Junior tech workers are in trouble across the world. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab released statistics confirming that entry level tech job postings are down 67% between 2023-2024, with a 13% drop in employment for 22-25 year-olds since AI arrived on the scene at the end of 2022. Tech jobs aren’t the only ones facing this issue. Employers reduced hiring by 8% in the last academic year (2024/2025), and another 7% is predicted for the coming year - but this figure focuses on responses from three large employers. “It is a tough market for students and young people in general. There is not much churn in the labour market and young people are suffering,” Stephen Isherwod, joint chief executive of ISE, told the Financial Times. The data suggests that organisations are simply focusing on hiring experienced workers, and cutting juniors out of the company structure as a cost saving measure, and to become more efficient. Whilst companies may see short-term gains with this strategy, it sets up a scenario for 10-20 years time when experienced professionals are set to retire, but no one has invested in training any juniors to take their place.
