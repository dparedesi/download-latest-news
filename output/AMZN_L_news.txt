Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. READ MORE: More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. READ MORE: China says U.S. violating tariffs truce with moves on AI chips and student visas Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs’ costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. WACTH MORE: What’s ahead for U.S. economy as global market reacts to Trump’s tariffs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.

Title: Intel might axe the 18A process node for foundry customers, essentially leaving TSMC with no rival — Intel reportedly to focus on 14A

TSMC's N2 and A16 may have no rivals When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lip-Bu Tan, the chief executive of Intel, is considering stopping the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication technology (1.8nm-class) to foundry customers, instead shifting the company's efforts to its next-generation 14A manufacturing process (1.4nm-class) in a bid to secure orders from large customers like Apple or Nvidia, reports Reuters. If this shift in focus occurs, it would be the second node in a row that Intel has deprioritized. The proposed adjustment could result in major financial consequences and alter the trajectory of Intel's foundry operations, as it will effectively withdraw the company from the foundry market for several years. Intel informs us that the information is based on market speculation. However, the spokesperson provided some additional insight on the company's roadmap, which we've added further below.“We are not going to comment on market rumors and speculation," an Intel spokesperson said to Tom's Hardware. "As we have said previously, we are committed to strengthening our roadmap, delivering for our customers and improving our financial position for the future." After taking the helm in March, Lip-Bu Tan announced intentions to cut costs in April, which is expected to involve layoffs and the cancellation of certain projects. According to the new report, by June, he began sharing with colleagues that the 18A manufacturing process — a technology designed to showcase Intel's manufacturing prowess — was losing appeal to outside customers, which is why he believed it made sense for the company to shift away from offering 18A and its performance-enhanced 18A-P version to foundry customers. Instead, Lip-Bu Tan proposed directing more resources to the completion and promotion of 14A, the company's next-generation node, which will be ready for risk production in 2027 and for volume production in 2028. Given the timing of 14A, it is now time to start promoting it among potential third-party Intel Foundry clients. Intel's 18A fabrication technology is the company's first node to utilize its 2nd-generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, along with a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). By contrast, 14A utilizes RibbonFET 2 transistors, PowerDirect BSPDN, which delivers power directly to each transistor's source and drain through specialized contacts, and features Turbo Cells for critical paths. In addition, 18A is Intel's first leading-edge technology that is compatible with third-party design tools and can be used by its foundry customers. Dropping external sales of 18A and 18A-P would require Intel to account for a substantial write-off reflecting the billions it spent developing the manufacturing technologies, according to individuals familiar with internal deliberations cited by Reuters. Depending on how you count development costs, the resulting charge could total hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Both RibbonFET and PowerVia were initially developed for 20A, but that technology was cancelled for internal products last August in a bid to focus on 18A for both internal and external products. Intel's rationale behind the move may be rather simple. By limiting the number of potential customers for 18A, the company may potentially cut its operating costs. The majority of tools required for 20A, 18A, and 14A (except for High-NA EUV equipment) are already in place at its Fab D1D in Oregon, as well as at Fabs 52 and 62 in Arizona. However, once these tools are formally put into operation, the company will have to report their depreciation as a cost. Not putting them online potentially enables Intel to cut its costs amid uncertainties with orders from third-party clients. In addition, by not offering 18A and 18A-P to external customers, Intel may save money on engineers dedicated to supporting the sampling, ramp, and mass production of third-party circuits at Intel fabs. Obviously, this is speculation on our side. However, by ceasing to offer 18A and 18A-P to external clients, Intel will be unable to demonstrate advantages of its fabrication nodes to a broad range of customers with various designs, which would leave them with a single choice for next two or three years: go with TSMC and use N2, N2P, or even A16. Although Samsung is set to formally start making chips on its SF2 (also known as SF3P) node later this year, that node is expected to be behind Intel 18A and TSMC's N2 and A16 in terms of power, performance, and area. Essentially, Intel would not be showing up to its fight against TSMC's N2 and A16, which will certainly not help to gain the confidence of potential clients towards other Intel offerings, namely 14A, 3-T/3-E, Intel/UMC 12nm, and others. Reuters' sources familiar with the matter explained that Lip-Bu Tan had asked Intel's specialists to prepare proposals for discussion with Intel's board this fall. Options could include ceasing efforts to sign up new clients for 18A, though given the scale and complexity of the issue, the decision might not be finalized until the board meets again later this year. Intel itself reportedly declined to discuss hypothetical scenarios but confirmed that the main customer for 18A has always been its own Products division, which plans to begin producing codenamed Panther Lake CPUs for laptops in 2025 using this technology. Eventually, 18A and 18A-P will be adopted by Clearwater Forest, Diamond Rapids, and Jaguar Shores products. Intel's push to attract large-scale external clients to its Intel Foundry fabs remains critical to its turnaround, as only with high volumes the company will be able to pay off for its process technologies that cost billions to develop. However, in addition to Intel itself, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defence have formally confirmed plans to use 18A. While Broadcom and Nvidia are also reportedly testing Intel's latest process technology, they have yet to commit to using it for actual products. Intel's 18A has one key advantage over TSMC's N2: it features backside power delivery, which is particularly useful for power-hungry processors aimed at AI and HPC applications. TSMC's A16 with Super Power Rail (SPR) will only enter mass production in late 2026, so 18A will maintain the advantage of offering backside power delivery for Amazon, Microsoft, and potentially other customers for a while. However, N2 is expected to offer higher transistor density, which is beneficial for the vast majority of chip designs. Furthermore, while Intel has been running Panther Lake silicon at its D1D fab for quarters (so, currently Intel is still in risk production using 18A), the company's high-volume Fab 52 and Fab 62 started to run 18A test silicon this March, so they will start producing commercial chips only late in 2025, or rather in early 2025. Intel's external customers are, of course, interested in producing their designs at high-volume fabs in Arizona rather than at development fabs in Oregon. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly considering halting the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication process to external clients and instead focusing on the next-generation 14A production node, aiming to attract large customers such as Apple and Nvidia. The move could trigger massive write-offs, as Intel has spent billions developing 18A and 18A-P process technologies. Shifting focus to 14A could help cut costs and better prepare the node and operations for third-party clients, but the move risks undermining customer confidence in Intel's foundry capabilities ahead of 14A's planned production in 2027–2028. While the 18A node remains critical for Intel’s own products, such as Panther Lake CPUs, limited demand from third parties — so far, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense have confirmed plans to use it — has raised concerns about its viability. The potential decision — which will essentially withdraw Intel from the broad foundry market until 14A comes to market — will be reviewed by Intel's board later this year. Even if Intel eventually chooses to remove 18A from its foundry offerings, aimed at a broad range of applications and clients, the company will still manufacture chips using 18A for its own products, which are already designed for the process. It also intends to fulfill limited orders it has already committed to, including supplying chips for the aforementioned clients.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, its third round of cuts in recent months, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The staff reduction will affect less than 4% of the company’s total workforce, or around 9,000 workers, according to a company spokesperson. It marks the tech giant’s largest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023 and comes amid workforce cuts elsewhere in the tech industry. Microsoft’s stock was unchanged following the announcement. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company is reducing managerial layers and making employees more productive with new technologies. The staff reduction also comes as tech companies, including Microsoft, are using artificial intelligence to make their workforce more efficient. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that 20% to 30% of the company’s code was being generated by AI, and the company is pouring billions into AI infrastructure investments. Related article Microsoft to lay off 3% of workforce, report says It’s unclear whether AI directly contributed to Wednesday’s cuts and which Microsoft divisions will be affected. The Verge reported that Xbox leader Phil Spencer sent an internal note saying that his staff would be affected. Bloomberg also previously reported that the planned July layoffs would target the sales and Xbox teams. Wednesday’s cuts come after Microsoft laid off 3% of its staff, roughly 7,000 employees, in May. As of July 2024, the last time Microsoft formally reported its total headcount, the company employed 228,000 workers. Other tech companies have also conducted layoffs this year, including Meta and Bumble. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also warned his staff last month that AI would eventually help the company reduce headcount. Microsoft said in April that its quarterly profits had increased 18% to $25.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, on the back of strong performance for its cloud business and AI services. The company is expected to release earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter later this month. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year. The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees. Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave. "We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient. A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes. The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers. Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven. It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency. Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."

Photo Credit: Reuters Microsoft had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024 Microsoft will lay off nearly 4% of its workforce, the company said on Wednesday, in the latest job cuts as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged $80 billion in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft said on Wednesday it planned to reduce organizational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on Wednesday. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5% of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit, and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across sectors in Corporate America, as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against further cost pressures. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. 29 April 2025, USA, San Jose: Lip-Bu Tan, Chief Executive Officer of Intel, appears at an event ... More organized by the company. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) Most investors chase headlines. I follow behavior. Today, Intel said more about the true state of its business—not in a press release, but in a quiet strategic walk-back that most will miss. Is Intel going for a breakup? Reuters reports that Intel’s new CEO is contemplating abandoning efforts to promote its highly anticipated 18A chip technology to external customers, despite having already invested billions in its development and promotion. On the surface, it’s a shift in product focus. But beneath this shift, it reveals a deeper behavioral insight. Intel envisioned its 18A chip node as the breakthrough technology that would spearhead its return to advanced chip manufacturing and secure foundry contracts from hyperscalers such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Now? Intel is quietly shelving it. Instead, Intel will pivot external customers to its newer 14A process, effectively cutting its losses and leaning into a more focused narrative: fewer bets, better execution. At the same time, the company is shuttering its automotive chip division, laying off staff across its foundry unit, and simplifying decision-making inside the fabs. That’s not cost-cutting. That’s positioning. This action isn’t an isolated move; it’s a pattern. And patterns in corporate behavior often preceded structural change. To the average investor, the move looks like textbook discipline: cut a struggling initiative, refocus on core customers, and redeploy capital more efficiently. But for those of us who study special situations, spinoffs, and corporate behavior, it signals something deeper. This isn’t just strategy, it’s a reset in how Intel thinks. This isn’t just about a product pivot. It’s a behavioral inflection point—and the kind that often comes before structural change. Let’s be clear: Intel hasn’t announced a spinoff. There’s no Form 10, no S-1, and no public timeline to separate the foundry business—yet. But in my experience, corporate breakups don’t start with filings. They start with behavior. And right now, Intel is moving like a company preparing to split. Here’s what I’m watching: Breakup isn’t just about unlocking value. They’re about rebuilding trust. Intel isn’t there yet—but it’s signaling to investors: We’ve heard you. We’re cleaning the house. Stick with us. And for special situation investors, that’s a setup worth tracking closely. Intel remains a complex name. But this foundry pullback offers three critical insights for investors watching through a special situation’s lens: For now, the situation is not a trigger. But in my experience, the best setups don’t come labeled. You need to delve deeper into the details. After nearly two decades studying breakups, restructurings, and hidden value plays, one thing is clear: they rarely start with headlines. They start with quiet decisions, internal shifts, and changes in incentives, not narratives. Intel’s foundry pivot might not spark a re-rating tomorrow. But for investors who track structural change, this is the kind of move that matters. It’s not the event, it’s the signal. Flag it. Log it. Watch it. An Intel breakup may be coming.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers.

China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

However, the company has continued to reduce its headcount — this is one of many rounds of layoffs to have already occurred this year.

Title: Analysis shows Trump’s tariffs would cost US employers $82.3 billion

Time Published: 2025-07-02T13:10:08Z

By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.

Title: Your manager might be asking AI whether or not they should fire you

Azure Gilman is the deputy editor for the Leadership desk at Fortune, assigning and editing stories about the workplace and the C-suite. Good morning! HR departments around the globe are trying to figure out how to implement AI into their company’s workflow, increase productivity, and cut down on busy work. But bosses may already be taking matters into their own hands and turning to robots when it comes to high-stakes personnel decisions. Around 60% of managers rely on AI to make choices about their direct reports, according to a new survey from Resume Builder, a career website. Out of this cohort, managers are using the technology to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and terminations (64%). Those statistics are concerning enough, but the training that these managers have under their belts while they ask AI for help makes them even more frightening. Only about 32% of managers using AI to manage people have received formal training to ethically do so, according to the report. And around 24% have received no training at all. “It’s essential not to lose the ‘people’ in people management,” says Stacie Haller, a career expert at Resume Builder. “While AI can support data-driven insights, it lacks context, empathy, and judgment. AI outcomes reflect the data it’s given, which can be flawed, biased, or manipulated. Organizations have a responsibility to implement AI ethically to avoid legal liability, protect their culture, and maintain trust among employees.”The latest study on how bosses are actually using AI emphasizes how untamed the practice really is in corporate America. Although companies are talking the talk when it comes to how they want employees to use LLMs, far fewer are walking the walk and creating coherent training and guidelines for their workforce. That freeform nature of AI use we’re seeing right now is exactly why some states like Colorado have already passed legislation to try and create guardrails about what kind of consequences an employee can suffer because of AI. Others, like California, are in the middle of trying to pass their own bills—if a long-promised federal AI legislation moratorium doesn’t interrupt them first. There’s no doubt about it, our AI reality is here. And along with an overwhelming obsession with productivity, companies need to start asking themselves about the more human side of AI, and how individuals might turn to the technology in unexpected ways as a method to guide their decisions. After all, no employee wants to hear about how they were ultimately terminated by a robot. “Organizations must provide proper training and clear guidelines around AI, or they risk unfair decisions and erosion of employee trust,” says Haller. Azure Gilmanazure.gilman@fortune.com A round-up of the most important HR headlines. Amazon will soon be using more robots than humans to work across the company’s many warehouses.

Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they’re close to a trade framework. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. “People who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they’ve never seen before,” Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: New Study Reveals Brutal Hit That U.S. Employers Face From Trump Tariffs

WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds that a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could be potentially managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category that includes roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. Fortune uses generative AI to help with an initial draft of each Fortune Intelligence story. An editor verifies the accuracy of the information before publishing. Given the nature of AI tools, mistakes may occur. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy delivered a clear message in his recent conversation with CNBC’s Jim Cramer: Artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape Amazon’s workforce, automating routine jobs while creating new opportunities in advanced technology fields. Jassy’s remarks, which echo a memo he sent to Amazon’s 1.5 million employees last month, underscore both the disruptive and transformative potential of generative AI across the company’s operations. Jassy told Cramer that, as with every major technological shift, “there will be fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate.” He emphasized that AI is already freeing Amazon employees from rote work, making jobs “more interesting,” and enabling staff to focus on innovation and higher-value tasks. For example, AI agents now handle coding, analytics, and research at Amazon, he said. However, Jassy was candid about the impact on headcount. He acknowledged that the adoption of generative AI will mean “fewer people” are needed for certain roles. In a recent internal memo, Jassy wrote, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Amazon has already been through significant layoffs, cutting more than 27,000 jobs over the past few years. Jassy positioned the ongoing transformation as an opportunity for those willing to adapt, urging employees to “be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings,” and to experiment with AI tools to “get more done with scrappier teams.” Jassy also pointed out that AI will create new jobs in areas such as robotics, AI development, and other fields requiring human creativity and complex decision-making. “I think that AI and generative AI specifically is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, which is saying a lot, given that we have had the internet,” he told CNBC.

Title: Microsoft dumps thousands of American workers in favor of cheaper foreign techies

By Amanda Bartolotta July 1, 2025 It often begins with a last-minute calendar invite – mandatory, with no explanation. For many workers in the tech industry, this has become a familiar signal. As the video meeting starts, hundreds of employees log in silently. Soon, human resources and legal representatives appear. The message is read. The decision is final. Employees are informed their positions are being eliminated. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! There is no opportunity for dialogue. Years of service are sometimes brought to an end in just a few minutes. Many of these employees had stayed late, worked weekends, mentored new team members and remained committed through difficult cycles. The meeting typically ends with a bland, impersonal, standard statement of appreciation. Executives often describe these actions as necessary for business reasons, with public statements citing over-hiring, inflation, economic uncertainty or the need for cost control. Workers are told the decision is not personal – just business. Still, for those impacted, the effects are significant. Many support families, carry student loans or are primary earners in their households. They return to a job market where opportunities are limited, especially when layoffs affect entire departments or industries at once. What many laid-off employees don’t realize is that the roles they once held may not have been permanently eliminated. Instead, those positions are sometimes quietly reassigned, reclassified or reopened, often without notice or transparency. The reassignment pattern: Layoffs followed by visa hiring While U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a new round expected this week targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut over 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. In its defense, Microsoft claims its 2025 job cuts affect less than 1% of its global workforce. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs. In total, the company filed 14,181 Labor Condition Applications, or LCAs – formal applications required to sponsor foreign workers for temporary employment visas, such as the H-1B – allowing them to work in U.S.-based jobs that are typically held by American workers. This made Microsoft the third-largest filer of foreign labor requests in the U.S., behind only NVIDIA and Amazon. According to U.S. Department of Labor data, nearly 82% of Microsoft’s new foreign workers were tagged at wage levels well below the median salary for those occupations. Howard University professor Ron Hira, a long-time critic of the program, observed that employers frequently pay the minimum they legally have to when utilizing the foreign guest worker program. “Prevailing wages are set far below the market price, inviting employers to exploit the program. The result is that most of the roughly 600,000 H-1B workers are paid below market price. This is an unfair outcome for U.S. and H-1B workers alike: U.S. workers’ wages are undercut and H-1B workers are underpaid.” Hira, author of “Outsourcing America,” co-authored an article documenting why “H-1B wage rules need an overhaul.” In addition to undercutting wages or laying off Americans to bring in more foreign workers, current U.S. law does not require companies to prove they tried to hire Americans first. They also aren’t obligated to notify laid-off employees if the same jobs are reopened through visa programs. Yet these practices are completely legal under existing immigration rules and occur with little oversight, no transparency and no protection for American workers. Strategic shifts The bottom line is that behind every announcement of “strategic realignment” is an American now facing uncertain days ahead, and often with no clear path back. For the American employees on the receiving end of layoff notices, the impact is deeply personal. They’re not just losing a paycheck, they’re losing healthcare, retirement contributions and a sense of security. That’s why Microsoft’s actions, while legal, remain anything but transparent. Most employees aren’t told similar jobs are being filled through H-1B visa requests. For those still employed, the silence only adds to their anxiety. With little information about how decisions are made or who might be next, many are left quietly wondering if they’re just one reorg away from losing everything too. Alongside its growing number of foreign labor filings, Microsoft has continued to expand operations overseas, especially in India. In January 2025, the company announced a $3 billion investment into India’s AI and cloud infrastructure over the next two years, alongside a plan to train 10 million Indian workers in AI-related skills by 2030. While Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees in the United States, the country where the company was founded and still earns the majority of its revenue, executives offered a different message abroad. In January 2025, the company confirmed that no layoffs were planned in India. “For all of India, more jobs are being created,” said Puneet Chandok, president of Microsoft India and South Asia, during a January 2025 interview. As Microsoft expands its commitments to the Indian government and workforce, its 14,181 H-1B visa requests reflect deepening ties with India-based firms. Notably, every single application was filed through Integreon Managed Solutions (INDIA) PVT LTD. This raises serious questions about how many of these roles are being reserved for Indian nationals, especially as American employees are laid off. With little transparency, it becomes increasingly difficult for U.S.-based workers to know whether their jobs are being relocated overseas or quietly filled at the very desks they once occupied. A shifting workforce These trends point to a larger shift in how companies like Microsoft manage their workforce. As layoffs hit U.S.-based employees, the company continues to scale up international hiring, infrastructure and talent development, especially in India. At the same time, the number of H-1B visa filings for foreign workers continues to grow, often for roles very similar to those recently cut in the U.S. All of this remains legal under existing U.S. labor and immigration policies. There are no requirements to prioritize American workers, no obligations to disclose when jobs are offshored and no systems in place to alert laid-off employees that similar roles may be refilled by cheaper foreign workers. For those affected, the result is a widening gap between where tech jobs are created and where they are lost, between American workers being displaced and foreign labor pipelines quietly expanding. What remains to be seen is whether this pattern will continue unchecked, or if policymakers and the public will reevaluate what it means to protect domestic opportunity in a global economy where American companies are increasingly driven by cost-cutting at any price, quiet partnerships and the abandonment of loyalty to their own countrymen.

Title: Kroger announces massive STORE CLOSURES nationwide by 2026, signaling strategic shift

Kroger is closing over 60 underperforming stores (including Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations) across multiple states by 2026, marking one of its largest retractions ever. The closures reflect industry-wide challenges like inflation, competition from Walmart and Aldi, and shifting consumer habits, forcing Kroger to cut costs to remain competitive. Despite minor sales declines (from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year) and a drop in net income, Kroger plans to reinvest savings into customer experience and new store openings in high-growth markets. No layoffs are planned as workers will be offered transfers, but relocations may disrupt employees in rural areas. The UFCW union has not yet raised major objections. Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries.

Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries. Kroger, one of America's largest grocery chains, is shutting down more than 60 underperforming stores nationwide in a sweeping cost-cutting move. The closures affecting Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations mark one of the most significant retractions in the company's history. Stores in Texas, Wisconsin, Georgia, Illinois and several other states will vanish by 2026, with some closing as early as this summer. The decision, announced during Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, comes as the company faces minor sales declines. However, the company insists it will reinvest savings into improving customer experience without layoffs. Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others. Whether this gamble pays off depends on whether reinvestment actually improves service or just shareholder returns. Visit Collapse.newsÂ for more similar stories.

Rite Aid to close up to 500 stores in BANKRUPTCY proposal. Sources include: DailyMail.co.uk MSN.com USAToday.com Brighteon.com Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others.

Title: What Happens To Work When AI Does The Easy Parts?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimeuchner/2025/06/30/what-happens-to-work-when-ai-does-the-easy-parts/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T01:43:26Z
Full Content:
ByJim Euchner ByJim Euchner, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A robot using artificial intelligence is displayed at a stand during the International ... More Telecommunication Union (ITU) AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, on May 30, 2024. Humanity is in a race against time to harness the colossal emerging power of artificial intelligence for the good of all, while averting dire risks, a top UN official said. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) A mantra in press releases about generative AI in corporations has been that it will ‘free up people to do more creative work.’ Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, claimed that “AI will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel.” But Microsoft also announced cuts of 6,000 jobs in May, partly attributed to AI automation. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, stated that “Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point… focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about improving customer experiences and inventing new ones.” Amazon has announced 27,000 layoffs since 2022, for some of which AI efficiencies were explicitly cited. Similar patterns exist for other tech firms, including Meta and Duolingo. What’s going on? Is this just a mismatch between PR and the efficiency imperative? Is there any evidence that the jobs are being redesigned for increased creative content, or are we experiencing a straightforward substitution of people for AIs? Perhaps is neither of these, but rather that contradictory messages are natural as executives naviate the fog of transition to a radically new technology. AI certainly has the potential to free people to spend more time on creative tasks. It can create slack time for learning, innovation, or deep thinking about a design. It can also be used to create jobs with broader accountability or a richer work environment. But if any of these is happening, it isn’t being discussed. That is too bad. Businesses could be missing an opportunity, one that goes beyond task automation to rethinking the design of work and technology. They may be missing the chance to take true advantage of the expanding capabilities of generative AI. A narrow focus on efficiency can shift attention away from other important metrics, like customer satisfaction and employee engagement. The irony is that an efficiency mindset might not even maximize efficiency, at least in the long run. In an interview, Patricia Sachs, a workplace anthropologist, told me that "automation mechanizes the way things are supposed to happen. But they almost never happen as expected." The reason is that much work in the real world is invisible, involving workarounds, improvisations, and social networks. As Sachs noted, "none of these appear in the workflow diagram or org chart." This was true at Klarna, a leader in the deployment of generative AI. The company has claimed that AI handles about two-thirds of customer service chats, equivalent to the work of over 700 agents. Their initial results showed, in addition, a drop in resolution times and reduced repeat inquiries, all while maintaining customer satisfaction. But Klarna has started to recruit human agents again, acknowledging that automation led to declines in service quality, customer satisfaction, and trust. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledged that "cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor" in the AI initiative, which led to reductions in quality, morale and trust. The company is now hiring human agents and seeking a more productive blend of AI efficiency and human empathy. Others are reaching similar conclusions. Ravin Jesuthasan, a senior partner at Mercer, cites lessons he learned from a large-scale case study of AI implementation at a financial services firm. The results were impressive, including a reduction in the work of the current staff by 50% and an 18% reduction in employee turnover. In the article, "Want AI-Driven Productivity? Redesign Work," he argues the key to lasting AI success is to start with the work, not the technology. These early experiences emphasize the importance of a focus the messy, human, frequently-changing work that is at the center of any good AI application. Starting with the technology risks missing something important that can erode financial benefits. So what should executives do? Success is more about mindset and taking an holistic approach than it is about technology. Moving beyond a narrow focus on efficiency will lead to more durable and customer-friendly technology and more productive workplaces.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond The exit interviews of Diamond Comic Distributor Staff, Lee Butman, Matt Demory, Joe Lunday, Trista Peterson, Sadie Campos and Ryan Shelkett The Exit Interviews for the six members of Diamond Comic Distributors who quit on the same day to go work for Alliance Entertainment, following Mike Schimmel, and kicking off another lawsuit in the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of the comic book publisher, have been unsealed. And they paint a picture of a distributor that people were pretty happy working at, until the bankruptcy. Though they did talk about the poor communication, both traditionally and with the new owners, how they didn't like learning things about their jobs and the bankruptcy on Bleeding Cool, and the lack of career advancement at Diamond due to so many people staying in their jobs and not moving on. Oh and then there were the fist bumps of new owner Joel Weinshanker of Ad Populum. Bleeding Cool published the exit interviews in full, but there's also an additional note Bleeding Cool is adding to Joe Lunday's entry, regarding the mention of fellow Diamond employee Steve Warble. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Merchandise Team Manager DATE HIRED – June 12, 2000 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Lee left the Company due to accepting a role with Alliance Entertainment. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Lee's new role will be Buyer – Consumer Product Specialist. Lee believes he will be working for Ryan Shelkett, former Executive Director of Applications Development. Lee said he was looking for stability. He felt there was a lack of communication from Ad Populum, including that they were not forthcoming with plans and the future. Lee also said he sent out his resume a few months ago to get feelers for potential new employers. Having a family, Lee needed stability to be able to support his family. Lee also shared that he was aware Alliance Entertainment had spoken with others. He said Alliance Entertainment was at the LA Toy Fair a few weeks ago and around the same time they were scheduled to buy the Company. Those who attended flew out to LA just after the deal fell through. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Lee said what he liked most were the people he worked with. He also said, in earlier years, Diamond felt like family. Once things began to change due to new management, Lee did his best to continue to maintain that type of atmosphere with his team. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Tying into his statement above, Lee felt, unfortunately, that the last ten (10) years seemed more corporate and colder. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Pretty good – Lee felt Ryan Shelkett did a good job, once he settled into his new role. Lee felt, ultimately, morale improved. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Lee said it was tough to advance. There were "long timers" in the Company. Therefore, it was hard to see opportunities to advance. C. COMMUNICATION – Fair – Lee felt the last five (5) months were not good. He hated that he read so much about what was happening in Bleeding Cool, versus the Company sharing information. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Good F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – If it weren't for the bankruptcy and recent sale, Lee envisioned working at Diamond until he retired. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – understood DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Assistant Manager – Print Team DATE HIRED – July 18, 2012 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Matt said he did not want to leave the Company. He had no ill will towards Diamond. That said, he had to do what was best for him and his family. He felt that Diamond lost too many employees and the core competency…too many pieces of the puzzle are gone. He said he was not sure how Diamond Book Distributors sales is supposed to function. He also felt that too much of the industry is rejecting Diamond, and too many businesses have made it clear they do not want to continue business with Diamond. Instead, they are moving to competitors. It seemed to become a trend where others felt this is what I'm supposed to do since everyone else is doing it. Matt's impression was DC and Marvel leaving made it look easy, so others followed. All that said, Matt worried that some of those that left realized the grass was not necessarily greener on the other side. However, they were locked into contracts that they could not get out of. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Matt will be a Buyer with Alliance Entertainment. He said they contacted him with an employment offer. In his new role, he will be working with a new set of accounts. However, he will continue using his skills to manage inventory. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No – Matt was ok with his salary. However, he was drained emotionally. He said he constantly felt like he was on the front line defending the company. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said he enjoyed everyone on his team. He grew up with comics and wanted to do something to encourage other kids to have the same opportunity. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said what he liked least was the software. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Matt enjoyed the freedom to work independently with the understanding that guidance was always available when needed. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Matt described advancement opportunities as "pretty flat". C. COMMUNICATION – Excellent – Matt felt people were good to respond timely. D. BENEFITS – NA – Matt said he was on his wife's insurance. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Poor – Matt could not remember the last time he received a pay increase. He understood that the Company faced tough times which resulted in no recent pay increases. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – Matt wished the very best for the future of the new Diamond. He hoped it could survive given how many were no longer with the Company as a result. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – Matt said he fully understood our policy. He felt that Alliance Entertainment has their own systems and way of doing things. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Matt said he very much respects Diamond. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Director of Ecommerce Sales DATE HIRED – November 28, 2022 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Joe left due to accepting a position with Alliance Entertainment. Joe will be helping to build the collectibles and toy program. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? Yes – However, he also said he was not going to be receiving a huge bump in pay. Joe added he was concerned about Diamond's future now that the sale to Ad Populum has taken place. Joe said he had a conversation with Chuck Parker, President, and was encouraged to stay but he had concerns about the future with vendors and the company, overall. Joe also said morale is very low across the organization. Ad Populum has provided no communication, leading others to wonder how much they really care about employees. Further, they eliminated the necessary roles to keep any attempt at success very limited. Additionally, Joe said when Joel Weinshanker from Ad Populum was in town and meeting with various employees, Joe's meeting with him, which he thought was scheduled for 15 minutes, lasted 4 minutes. Joe's impression was that it was 2 minutes longer than Joel would have liked. Joel came off as very off putting. Joe went into the meeting with questions for Joel. Joe walked away with the strong impression that Joel really only wanted the warehouse and was meeting with employees as a formality. Also, when Joe walked into the meeting, Joel fist bumped him and then proceeded to read his name and title off of a piece of paper. Joel then asked what Joe did. Joe explained his role in sales and read sales data information from last year. He further described the business…Japanese, Taiwan, Amazon, Godzilla. Joel asked who his contact was at Amazon. Joel gave very little feedback during the brief encounter. Joe shared that he later spoke with Steve Warble, Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager. Steve told Joe that his meeting lasted 3 minutes. He, too, had the same impression of Joel. Additionally, Joe said he was speaking with someone else (he did not share who) and that individual said that Joel told them directly "you know I did not get a good first impression of you". Joel later changed his tune when he admitted to needing the person. Joe also said that he was told that Mike Schimmel and Tim Lenaghan were forced by Joel to make snap staff decisions…keep vs who to let go. This was hard for them to do given that many of the staff are in various departments. Therefore, Mike and Tim did not have strong knowledge of good vs bad. They felt like that had to make random decisions vs well thought out. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said what he liked most were the people. He also enjoyed being able to maximize sales. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said, long term, he always struggled with pay. He felt Diamond lost a lot of good people due to the low pay they provided. Further the pay did not always match the talent. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Joe felt his team was well organized. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Good – Joe said he started in Order Entry, then moved to Retailer Services and ultimately moved into the role of Sales Manager and promoted to Director. Joe said his only resentment was not being made a Director sooner. He left the Company for a period of time to go to Funko. It was when he returned that he was made a Director. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Joe said he spoke quite a bit recently with Chuck Parker. Joe felt Chuck was trying very hard. He felt bad for Chuck as he wanted to give feedback but needs guidance from the new owners to let people know what is going on. D. BENEFITS – Good – Joe said he only participated in the 401K plan since he is on his wife's insurance. He also felt the vacation and sick time was generous. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Joe said this was tough to answer. He felt it went through a lot of phases and, unfortunately, many people went without raises for a long time. Further, as stated above, many were underpaid for the work they did. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Joe said he believed in Diamond. He said there was a reason he chose to return after he left for a period of time. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? Joe said he fully understood the Company's policy. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Joe said, going forward, he was concerned for those employees who were staying with Ad Populum. He hopes they have a future there, and hopes they are paid accordingly, particularly given the reduction in staff which will result in more work. Also, Joe pointed out that he was told he would be receiving a retention bonus of 10% of his salary, which he said was $9,300. He would like to know when he will receive this. ADDITIONAL: Steve Warble, Diamond Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager posted to Daniel Best's Substack, who has also posted these exit interviews, saying "For the record, my meeting with Joel was only about 5 minutes, but I deny ever saying that I thought Joel only wanted us for the warehouse. I did say that another employee who I won't name had said that exact thing. I am also furious that my name has been dragged into this without anyone asking me" also adding "I am not angry at you or any other journalist that quotes the legal documents, and there is no need to redact anything. I am not even angry at Joe Lunday, as I know he is an honest man and I am sure he stated the conversation as he remembered it.

Trista said communication lacked and seemed siloed, particularly over the last few months. She found it frustrating that information was not shared with employees. Instead, information was learned from Bleeding Cool and ICV2. Because information was on the internet, retailers contacted Trista and her team. However, they were not able to answer questions. 5.

COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Sadie said she was happy with her compensation. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Even with everything going on, Sadie said there were a lot of great things about the Company. That said, she felt there was zero infrastructure. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Sadie said when the announcement about the bankruptcy came out, she could handle that. She was disappointed that with the lawsuits up to what is transpiring now, there is no communication. She was frustrated that nothing was shared about DST being shut down after the sale and with no plan in place for "what's next". Sadie interacted with DST on a regular basis. She felt she was left to pick up the pieces with no direction. Sadie said morale is awful and stressed that a Team Hall needs to take place, so people understand what is going on. Sadie also liked that the Company allowed employees to work remote. That said, her perspective was that many people took advantage of it. From day 1, Sadie said she could have listed names of people who should have been let go due to not working. Unfortunately, some of those people were still with the Company (Sadie did not provide names).

Ryan explained that he had been looking for a new job since the bankruptcy announcement was made in January 2025. He researched opportunities in a variety of industries. However, he stopped when he was asked to stay through the transition period. Ryan also said he was told by Tim Lenaghan, Chief Purchasing Officer, if he stayed, he would receive a retention bonus of $16,000.

I pulled this to see what he was referring to: "The rate for this position will be $155,000.00, to be paid to you on a bi-weekly basis. Additionally, within six (6) months of your start date, we will jointly develop metrics to be used to evaluate a bonus of between 10-20% of this annual salary. $10,000 of this bonus will be provided to you as an initial signing bonus, to be paid to you with the first scheduled pay date, September 8, 2023, after joining the Company.

Title: Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat

ByMark Murphy ByMark Murphy, Senior Contributor. Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat There's been no shortage of news about recent workforce changes and even layoffs as a result of AI. Perhaps most famously, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message to employees: "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, speaking on a recent earnings call about AI, said, "But beyond that, all the way from the Finance team preparing for this earnings call, to everything, it’s deeply embedded in everything we do. But I still see it as early days, and there’s going to be a lot more to do." IBM has reportedly eliminated around 8,000 positions, including a large number in HR, while CEO Arvind Krishna noted that the company has been aggressively adopting AI and automation. Joining the list of notable companies with AI-related layoffs are Microsoft, Intel, Meta, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, Dell, and more. Now, technology companies are, not surprisingly, the ones making headlines, but the impact of AI is being felt far beyond the tech industry. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, an AI powerhouse, recently told Axios that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently wrote that "While the technology sector is feeling the first waves of change, reflecting A.I.'s mass adoption in this field, the erosion of traditional entry-level tasks is expected to play out in fields like finance, travel, food and professional services, too." But here's where the story takes a troubling turn. While CEOs and industry leaders are publicly acknowledging AI's transformative impact on employment, a comprehensive new study from Leadership IQ reveals that the vast majority of business leaders may be living in denial about what's actually coming. The AI Readiness 2025 study, which surveyed 1,251 executives, directors, and managers across diverse industries, uncovered a striking paradox that should alarm anyone concerned about organizational preparedness. Despite nearly 80% of business leaders now personally using AI tools—a dramatic surge from just two years ago—a staggering 56.4% either don't expect AI to replace employees in their organizations over the next three years or remain completely uncertain about it. Let that sink in for a moment. More than half of the decision-makers responsible for steering organizations through the AI revolution either don't see job displacement coming or have no idea whether it's coming at all. AI Readiness 2025 Study The breakdown is even more revealing: 35.9% of leaders flatly don't believe AI will replace employees, while another 20.5% simply don't know. Only 43.6% acknowledge that AI will likely lead to job displacement, with just 12.8% expecting a "significant number" of replacements and 30.8% anticipating a "small number." What makes these findings particularly concerning is their consistency with our 2023 baseline study. Despite nearly three years of unprecedented AI development since ChatGPT's launch, despite the public statements from tech CEOs about workforce reductions, and despite widespread personal experience with AI tools, leadership attitudes about AI's employment impact have remained remarkably static. This isn't simply a case of cautious optimism—it's a potentially dangerous case of what researchers call "optimism bias," where decision-makers systematically underestimate the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes. When Andy Jassy tells his employees that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today," but 56% of business leaders don't expect job displacement in their own organizations, we have a fundamental disconnect between industry reality and leadership perception. The implications are staggering. If the majority of business leaders are unprepared for AI-driven workforce changes, their organizations will be caught flat-footed when those changes accelerate. Employees will receive inadequate warning and retraining opportunities. Strategic planning will be based on flawed assumptions. And companies may find themselves scrambling to adapt when competitors who took AI's impact seriously begin to pull ahead with leaner, more AI-integrated operations. Perhaps most telling is that this skepticism extends to leaders' views of their own roles. Despite using AI tools daily and seeing their capabilities firsthand, 46% of business leaders either don't believe AI will impact their own jobs or remain uncertain about it. This personal blind spot may be fueling the broader organizational denial. It's a classic case of "it won't happen to me" thinking, amplified across entire leadership teams. If executives can't acknowledge that AI might transform their own roles—roles that often involve strategic thinking, analysis, and decision-making that AI is increasingly capable of supporting or even replacing—how can they realistically assess the impact on their organizations? This leadership disconnect creates a "preparation crisis." While AI capabilities continue expanding at breakneck speed, the majority of organizations may be operating under the assumption that significant workforce disruption isn't coming—or at least isn't coming soon. The contrast with forward-thinking leaders couldn't be starker. When Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% within five years, he's not speaking hypothetically. Anthropic is at the forefront of AI development, and their CEO has a front-row seat to what's coming next. Yet our study suggests that most business leaders either haven't internalized these warnings or don't believe they apply to their organizations. This isn't just concerning—it's potentially catastrophic for organizational competitiveness and employee welfare. Despite these concerns, there is a glimmer of hope. A recent PwC report found that workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium. And given how few people have advanced AI skills, it's really not that hard to elevate your AI skillset quickly and stand out from everyone else. As Amazon's CEO put it in his memo, "Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company."

Title: CEOs Are Quietly Telling Us the Truth: AI Is Replacing You

The fear is real. In meetings, Slack chats, and after-work drinks, one question is quietly eating away at millions of employees: Will AI take my job? In public, CEOs like to sound reassuring. They say generative AI will âenhance productivityâ or âstreamline operations.â But when you actually read what they’re telling their own employees, or what slips out in investor memos, the message is chilling: virtual workers are here, and theyâre not just assistants. Theyâre replacements. Letâs take a closer look at what some of the worldâs most powerful tech CEOs are saying. Not in hype videos, but in official internal messages, blog posts, and investor updates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently published a company-wide message that sounds reasonable, until you actually read it. âAs we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today… We expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.â The key phrase? âNext few years.â Thatâs corporate speak for 2026 to 2028. Not ten years away. This is soon. Jassy is not talking about automating only simple or repetitive tasks. Heâs preparing employees for a reality where AI replaces entire job categories across the board, and where hiring slows or stops altogether for roles that machines can now do. In a memo posted to LinkedIn, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was even more blunt. âMost functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work… Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.â Translation: No more hiring unless your job is impossible for AI to do. The company is betting that most teams will soon need fewer humans. Shopify CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke shared a similar directive on X: âBefore asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI… What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?â LÃ¼tke is openly asking managers to reimagine teams as if AI agents are already integrated, and to justify why any humans are still necessary. https://t.co/6i6h3sKi3x — tobi lutke (@tobi) April 7, 2025 The message from these CEOs is clear: human employees are now the last resort. The new default is automation. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI is already doing 50% of the work within his company, shortly before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. The CEO of Klarna, a major fintech company, was even more blunt, revealing that AI has already allowed the company to reduce its workforce by 40%. These arenât future scenarios. This is already happening. The reason for this sudden shift is the rapid evolution of AI technology. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a recent podcast, the latest “reasoning models” have made a critical leap. In simple terms, these AI systems can now do more than just find information; they can “think” through complex, multi-step problems. Altman suggested these models can reason on par with someone holding a PhD, meaning they are now capable of performing the high level analytical tasks once reserved for highly educated humans. This capability is being actively harnessed. Three sources working at major AI labs told Gizmodo that they are training powerful models to perform real world tasks in nearly every “knowledge work” profession, including banking, financial analysis, insurance, law, and even journalism. These sources, who requested anonymity as their contracts prohibit them from speaking publicly, described how their work is used in side by side comparisons with AI models to refine the technology until it can produce professional grade output with minimal errors. Virtual employees are already doing our jobs; the current phase is simply about making them more perfect. The “next few years” Jassy spoke of may be closer to two years at most. Consider the tech industry’s recent layoff trends. In 2024, 551 tech companies laid off nearly 152,922 employees, according to data from Layoff.fyi. The pace has accelerated dramatically this year. In just the first six months of 2025, 151 tech companies have already laid off over 63,823 people. On average a tech company cut 277 workers in 2024. If that rate is maintained for the rest of the year, the average number of layoffs per tech company in 2025 would soar to 851, roughly three times the 2024 average. While there is no direct evidence linking all these layoffs to AI, the trend is happening during a period of record economic strength. The Nasdaq just closed at an all time high, and eight of the world’s ten largest companies are in the tech sector. Profitable, growing companies are shedding workers at an alarming rate, and the quiet implementation of AI is the most logical explanation. Tech CEOs wonât tell you outright that youâre being replaced. But the memos speak for themselves. AI is already here, and your company is likely building a roadmap to automate you out of your role. One internal pilot project at a time. One chatbot at a time. One hiring freeze at a time. If you want to understand whatâs next for the American workforce, donât listen to the marketing. Read the footnotes in the CEOâs blog. Because theyâre already telling you the truth.

Cloudflare, a company that runs 20% of the web, just flipped a switch that could end the open internet as we know it, forcing AI companies to pay for the content theyâve been taking for free.

Microsoftâs Xbox division just laid off thousands of employees, shut down an entire game studio, and canceled multiple projects, even as the company insists that everything has never been better.
