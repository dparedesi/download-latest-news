Amazon.com is restructuring the Wondery podcast studio by shifting its award-winning narrative podcasts such as "Business Wars" to Audible and consolidating creator-led shows into a new unit, according to a memo seen by Reuters. About 110 employees will be laid off as part of the process, while many Wondery employees will transition to other parts of Amazon, the company said in an emailed statement on Monday. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will depart the company following a transition period, the memo said. Intense competition in the expensive podcast industry as well as a growing focus on creator-led video content have prompted audio streaming companies including Spotify to diversify their podcasts as they look to lower costs and attract more users to their platforms. "As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series," Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch and games at Amazon, wrote in the memo. Wondery was acquired by Amazon in 2021 and has seen podcast revenue quadruple since then as the studio expanded its slate to include video podcasts and creator-driven series, according to the memo. Under the new structure, Wondery's narrative podcast studio - home to shows such as "Dr. Death" and "American Scandal" - along with the Wondery subscription service, will move to Audible, the e-commerce giant's audio platform. Its creator-focused podcast team that produces shows including "Mind the Game", "New Heights", and "Armchair Expert" will join a new Creator Services group within Amazon's Talent Services division. This new team will continue to operate the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand. "By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels," Amazon said. Bloomberg News first reported on the Wondery overhaul.

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Amazon is reorganizing its audio entertainment operations with plans to consolidate some of the production now done across its Wondery and Audible brands. As a result of the changes, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is exiting her post after four years at the helm of one of the industry’s largest podcast studios. Amazon disclosed the changes with an internal memo from Steve Boom, who is VP of audio, Twitch and games for Amazon. The reorganization will include about 100 layoffs.

Popular on Variety Wondery podcasts that were more narrative-driven such as true crime favorites “Dr. Death” and “Dirty John” will now shift under the Audible brand, which encompasses original audio production as well as a vast audio book library. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. In a statement, Amazon positioned the changes as a streamlining of audio content across the comapny’s vast media footprint. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon,” Amazon said in a statement. “By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: EA Explains Why Fans Aren’t Getting The Sims 5

Dynasty WarriorsThe Sims 5Unions Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to The Sims 4? Why is Dynasty Warriors 3 objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at Kotaku experiment with reviving our old Morning Checkpoint roundup series that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first Call of Duty developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go! That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) told Variety when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. âWhat I wouldnât want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that youâve purchased over the years,â she said. âWe put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.â What fans are getting is a Sims movie with help from Barbie‘s Margot Robbie. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on Apex Legends. Quality assurance devs at Call of Duty support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union amid the 2021 workplace fallout, but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at Updater now reports that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao. Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is continuing to blaze through temperature records. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company posted. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5â35Â°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch back in 2022. Everything is going great, folks. Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the Dynasty WarriorsÂ series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary. Dynasty Warriors Origins, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. Dynasty Warriors 3, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games? Over 1 million people claimed the FreedomToBuy bundle from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, the storefront reports. It included Postal 2, Agony, Fetish Locator Week One, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io due to payment processors. The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when Metroid Prime 4 is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada near the end of August. A November release date is feeling more and more likely. Someone on Reddit found a leaked Amazon listing for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating the 40th anniversary of Rare, the studio best known for Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and Sea of Thieves, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and looks very nice. There’s also a vinyl soundtrack collection and Evercade cartridges for old Rare games. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

Title: It's been a rough year for Rare but at least Xbox is celebrating its 40th anniversary with... a licensed controller

"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone." As Rare - known for the likes of Sea of Thieves, Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online. The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via reddit). The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the Amazon listing, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller. "A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life." Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below. Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment. This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business. "From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," it wrote, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below). "For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU." Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox. Everwild was first revealed in late 2019. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves. Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on Donkey Kong 64 and many more games - had left the studio after more than 35 years.

Title: Why Platforms Like Substack Won't Make Sense for Much Longer
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/future-of-substack
Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I think the future of Substack is self-hosting. Or—more directly—I don't think they have much of a future. I'm sure you've heard about their struggles—the $585M valuation after failing to raise a Series C in 2022, the 14% staff layoffs, the major creator exodus in early 2024 over content moderation failures, and the fact that prominent writers like Casey Newton's Platformer jumped ship to competitors. Substack is showing all the classic warning signs. But I care more about the fact that people had to go to Substack in the first place, and that they're now unhappy. To me it's part of a larger truth about the platforms in general. I've been blogging since 1999 and I've seen a few dozen popular writing platforms over the years, and have probably used nearly a dozen myself. I think the reason these platforms are on a fuse is because they tend to toxify over time. Here's a not-even-comprehensive list of the platforms and why they're no longer around. Why it failed: Acquired by Twitter, then shut down Twitter acquired for talent, not product. Couldn't compete with Tumblr's growth. Shut down April 30, 2013. Peak: 4.5M monthly users. Why it failed: Lack of revenue, couldn't compete with Twitter Too complex (tried to combine microblogging, file sharing, events). Acquired by Six Apart and immediately shut down Dec 2008. Only had ~100k users at peak. Why it failed: Low engagement, poor features Microsoft auto-created accounts for all 500M Hotmail users but only 30M were active. Migrated to WordPress.com Sept 2010. Why it failed: Financial difficulties Pioneered blogging but couldn't afford servers. Shut down Feb 2014 after data loss. Relaunched 2018 as subscription-only. Why it failed: Legal battle (Hulk Hogan lawsuit) $140M verdict in lawsuit funded by Peter Thiel. Filed bankruptcy, shut down Aug 2016. Relaunched 2021 but minimal traffic. Why it failed: NSFW ban, cultural mismatch with Yahoo/VerizonLost 30% of traffic after Dec 2018 adult content ban. Sold by Yahoo for $1.1B (2013), later sold to Automattic for less than $3M (2019). Why it failed: Failed to gain traction Six Apart's attempt at "neighborhood blogging." Never exceeded 600k users. Shut down Sept 30, 2010. Why it failed: Still alive but stagnant under Google Acquired by Google 2003. Last major update 2020. Lost 90%+ market share to WordPress. Many features deprecated. Why it failed: Sold to Russian company, user exodusSold to SUP Media (Russia) 2007. Servers moved to Russia 2016, triggering privacy concerns and mass exodus. Why it failed: Failed to evolve, lost to Facebook/MySpace Peak: 40M users (2005). Shut down 2013, raised $60k to relaunch as "Xanga 2.0." Now basically dead. Why it failed: Repeated pivots, paywall confusion Multiple layoffs: 2017 (50 people), 2021 (75), 2023 (unknown). Changed business model 5+ times. Major publications left platform. Why it failed: Failed to grow beyond niche Started as invite-only "elite" network. Opened to public 2014 but too late. No meaningful updates since. Estimated <10k active users. Why it failed: Struggles with mainstream adoptionRaised $5M+ via Kickstarter/revenue. Only ~2.5k paying Ghost(Pro) customers despite being around 10+ years. $200+/month pricing drives users to competitors. Why it failed: Lost creators to self-hosting While WordPress.org powers 43% of the web, WordPress.com has <0.4% market share. Creators graduate to self-hosted after hitting limitations. Why it failed: Creator exodus, content moderation crisisPlatformer, Casey Newton left Jan 2024 over Nazi content. Flat $585M valuation after failed Series C (2022). 14% layoffs June 2022. Top writers leaving to avoid 10% fee. Currently growing (benefiting from competitor issues) Founded by Morning Brew alumni. Raised $33M Series B at $192M valuation (Apr 2024). 100k+ newsletters, grew 10x in 2023. Flat pricing beats Substack's %. So there's this massive history of these platforms rising up to consume the users fleeing the previous failure. Only to then fall apart themselves years later. Another way to make this point might be to ask why we needed these platforms in the first place? Why were there so many of these? And why did they do so well for so long? It's because individual writers couldn't do one or more of the following: Well, it's now a whole lot easier to do all three. Creating a website that hosts a blog is fairly trivial for AI today, and it will only become more trivial in the months and years to come. So any would-be writer can simply have AI help build them a blog. And it won't even have to look exactly like all the other pages, which is a problem on a site like Substack, who wants to maintain its own branding above that of the creator. Sending mass emails is still a bit of a dark art, but there are services like Amazon SES that AI could also use to build this infrastructure fairly easily. Not to mention using any of the other third-party services that are designed to help people do this. It just becomes a matter of integration with those tools, which AI is really good at. And finally, the benefit of a platform for getting eyes onto your content I think is diminishing as well. First of all, it's not clear to me that anyone on Substack is just getting tons of traffic by virtue of just being there. Second, I think sites like Google and other AI-powered platforms are going to get extremely good at finding the content jewels of what's publicly available and raising them up to others. Basically, AI-powered content discovery. And I think that will have far more impact at lifting the best content. The bottom line is, we're just going to be able to do these things on our own. The platforms tend to be extremely toxic and highly restrictive, and they don't last long anyway. And the only reason they existed in the first place is because it was hard to do the things that they provided. And now with AI, that is all going away.

Title: How To Collect Dividends Up To 11% From Tech Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/03/how-to-collect-dividends-up-to-11-from-tech-stocks/

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight. Columbia Seligman’s CEF writes covered calls, too—typically on the Nasdaq-100, but again, it has more flexibility. For instance, right now, management is selling Apple calls, too. The strategy works. In fact, it works mighty well. STK still has its drawbacks. Unlike other covered-call funds, Columbia Seligman’s fund is actually more volatile than the Nasdaq, not less. Moreover, while the ETFs pay monthly, this CEF is only paying us on a quarterly schedule—and at current prices (which admittedly represent a slight discount to net asset value), it’s paying us just half as much as JEPQ and QYLD.

Title: Big Tech has cut over 100,000 jobs this year — and the AI revolution is just getting started

Since the start of the year, Big Tech has shed over 100,000 jobs. Sure, some of these layoffs are just standard corporate belt tightening, but it is now clear that AI is impacting the job market — and entry- and mid-level workers are being hit the hardest. This underscores a defining question of our time: Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities and industries that we can’t yet imagine? So far, AI is displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created. The displacement of workers through automation is nothing new. Emerging technologies upend legacy companies and industries, and usher in new organizations with better jobs with higher pay. It’s a cycle that’s been dubbed “creative destruction” by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Throughout history, that has meant short-term pain for long-term gain — at least for some. On the one hand, the automobile put farriers and stage-coach drivers out of business but created millions of good-paying jobs for automotive assembly workers and truck drivers. On the other, the internet replaced many department-store clerks, travel agents, taxi drivers and journalists with Amazon fulfillment center workers, Uber drivers, content creators and others who often work more hours for less pay with fewer benefits. And in the Rust Belt and factory towns, automation has eliminated countless workers with no obvious replacement in sight. The disruption from AI could make this look like kids’ stuff. Historically, technology has automated workers at the periphery — those with low skills that can easily be substituted. AI will automate everything, everywhere, all at once, displacing knowledge workers and managers in every industry. Ironically, tradespeople like welders, electricians, plumbers and carpenters who were told “learn to code” may be the last to get automated away. Already, engineers at Amazon are complaining that their role has been degraded as they’re asked to do more with AI. There is an added concern that AI will kill many careers before they begin. In a recent interview with Axios, Dario Amodei, CEO of AI darling Anthropic, said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. A LinkedIn executive echoed this sentiment in a recent New York Times essay with the alarming title “The bottom rung of the career ladder is breaking,” citing at-risk entry-level jobs such as paralegals and call center operators. Tech CEOs seem unfussed by the potential of a looming cataclysm — if anything, they’re doing what they can to usher it in. Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan this year that AI will replace most of Meta’s mid-level engineers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that AI already writes 30% of the company’s code. In the last few months, Microsoft has fired more than 15,000 people. Shareholders are rewarding executives that adopt AI and slash headcount: Microsoft’s stock just hit an all time high. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. As he’s musing about mass cuts to his workforce to Rogan, Zuckerberg is also poaching the top AI minds from competitors like OpenAI and Apple with eye-popping pay packages. Ruoming Pang was lured away from Apple with an offer worth $200 million — triple what Apple CEO Tim Cook made last year. Is AI exposing yet another fault line between haves and have-nots? Is this a harbinger of what we can come to expect from an AI economy? So far AI has created huge wealth for founders, investors and the top 0.01% of tech talent. But what about the rest of us? This goes beyond business with implications for governments and society. President Trump initially rose to popularity by tapping into the anger and fears of an aging blue-collar work force who felt left behind by globalization and automation. He sustained his appeal by broadening his coalition to include a more diverse and younger part of the electorate, namely Gen Z men, who are among the most at-risk groups when it comes to being replaced by AI. An economy where young people can’t find work could deepen Gen Z’s economic pessimism into existential nihilism. New technologies are always greeted with a mixture of hope, trepidation and outright pessimism. Ultimately, technology has no agency. It is not morally good or bad. It is a tool, created and wielded by people. Human beings learned to make fire, and cook food, stay warm and clear land for agriculture — or burn down a rival’s hut.

On 27 June, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) made headlines when it announced plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs, marking the largest layoff in the software services major’s history. The move sparked debate, with some industry observers interpreting it as fallout from artificial intelligence (AI), and warning of similar cuts at other major firms. However, TCS chief executive K. Krithivasan attributed the decision to skill mismatches, not AI. Days later, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said his company remained committed to hiring 20,000 freshers in FY26. The contrasting statements suggested that the layoffs were likely tied to TCS’s internal restructuring rather than indicative of an industry-wide trend. Still, the sector hasn’t resolved the structural challenges that have built up over the past few years. Investor confidence in IT stocks has eroded significantly from a year ago. While major companies have delivered strong returns over five years, their stock prices have declined over the past year—falling further in 2025 and trailing the BSE Sensex’s modest 3% year-to-date gain. Much of the market pessimism stems from softening demand in key Western markets, where clients are tightening budgets while AI capabilities expand. This has forced the industry to focus heavily on cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Major IT players have dramatically reduced their workforce—TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra together employ 56,000 fewer people now than they did two years ago. Western pressuresSome of this drive comes from the sector’s peers in the West. A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. Also Read | Three years on, AI is prompting IT companies to cut workforce The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth. Margins across leading firms have come under pressure, as pricing constraints and intensifying competition weigh on the sector. TCS, which has consistently reported the highest margins among peers, also made the boldest restructuring move—underscoring how central efficiency will be in the years ahead.

Title: I left my job in tech and moved to Spain. Being alone in a foreign country is hard, but it's changed me for the better.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/left-tech-moved-from-austin-texas-to-barcelona-spain-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-02T10:23:01Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Parrie Hartley, 30, who moved from Austin to Barcelona in February 2025. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I'm from a really small town outside of Houston, where there are not a lot of employment opportunities. I've always been a city girl at heart, so in 2020, after a brief stint living in Australia, I moved to Austin and started working in software sales. Austin's tech scene is booming. Many, like big corporations, like Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, have opened offices there, bringing with them a lot of jobs. Moving there definitely built my career and made me a lot of money. Living in the city was awesome, too. It's a great place for young people, with an amazing culture, food, and music scene. There are a lot of events, and I definitely made some really great friends there. In May 2024, the startup company I was working for started making layoffs. By then, I had already started thinking about leaving Austin. I had been in the city for five years and was itching for a change. Everything in my life was perfect on paper, but I still missed adventure. I've always been very curious about the world, and I really do think I'm the best version of myself when traveling. At the time, I was 29 and single. I had no husband, job, children, or pets. My parents were healthy, so I didn't really have anything tying me down. I decided, "Why don't I move abroad?" I had been working in sales, so I had built up quite a bit in savings. But once I decided to move, I sold everything — furniture, clothes, anything that I could get money from. In Austin, I lived alone in a 1,100-square-foot apartment on the East Side, downtown, and paid $1,800 monthly on rent. To save money, I moved back to my hometown and started picking up some shifts at a local boutique. I considered a lot of different places to move abroad. I had already lived in Australia, so I checked that off the list. I'd also been to Asia, which I enjoyed, but I felt that living there might have been too much of a culture shock. So, I began researching visa options for Europe. One option was a student visa, which I discovered could be obtained by enrolling in a language school. The visa was available in Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As a Texan, I didn't feel a strong need to learn Portuguese or Italian. I had also visited Spain when I was 22, during a backpacking trip with friends to Barcelona, and had a great time. I figured that if I moved there, I could learn Spanish and be close to the other European countries I wanted to visit. It took about four weeks to organize all of my paperwork for the visa. I had to obtain an FBI background check, get a medical clearance from a doctor, show proof of health insurance, and submit my bank statements to show that I had sufficient funds in my account. In the end, everything came together, and my visa was approved just three days before my flight to Spain in February. I attend a Spanish language school called Expanish in Spain. I have classes five days a week, four hours a day. The course lasts 40 weeks, with eight weeks of holiday included. I paid $6,800 in total. I live in a neighborhood pretty close to the Church of La Sagrada Família , which is not only the most famous building in Barcelona, but possibly in all of Spain. Since I'm in such a central area, there are a lot of tourists and markets around, but the area itself is still fairly quiet. My building is between three major metro stations. Figuring out the metro was initially a challenge for me as an American, but it turned out to be super easy. I feel safe walking there day or night because the area has low crime. I got really lucky finding an apartment through a rental website called Idealista. They matched me with a couple, and I'm paying €600 ($686) for my room. I pay €10 ($11) a month for WiFi, plus water and electricity, which adds another €40 ($46) a month. The apartment is around 753 square feet and came fully furnished, which was great. We have air conditioning, but unfortunately, it doesn't reach my room, which is rough in the summer. Meeting people in Barcelona is easy, and the people are very warm and welcoming. The city is filled with people from all over the world. Most are away from their families, here for a year or two, so eventually, you end up creating your own little family. Often, making friends is as simple as going out and striking up a conversation — if you hear someone speaking English, you just start talking. I've met plenty of people through my language school, though it tends to be a revolving door since it's a temporary program, and most students are only around for three or four months. Outside of school, I've built friendships through Bumble BFF. I also joined a volleyball league when I first got here, and I play regularly. I haven't ventured onto the dating apps just yet. I'm 30, and I do want to build toward a relationship, but I feel like I need to get my life a bit more together first. That said, I'm definitely having fun meeting people. I've met guys from Brazil, the Netherlands, and Colombia — it's been a really fun mix. Honestly, it feels a bit like being a kid in a candy store. Most of my time here has been really positive. I spend a lot of time at the beach, and I'm walking up to 20,000 steps a day. You can really see the difference in my face. I've also been traveling. In July, I visited Menorca, one of the Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain. My round-trip flight was only €40 ($45.72). I just packed a backpack with bikinis and went. This month, I'm also heading to Mallorca because I scored free tickets to the Love Island UK finale. Right now, I earn money tutoring both kids and adults in English during after-school hours. I'm also helping my cousin, a lawyer in Texas, with some administrative work. My current visa is valid for one year and will expire in early February 2026. I'd love to stay longer, so I'm exploring the option of applying for a digital nomad visa. It's available in several European countries and essentially allows you to live and work remotely, as long as you meet certain income requirements and have health insurance. As for moving back to the US, I don't plan on it, at least not if I don't have to. Of course, there are cultural challenges that come with living abroad, especially in a place where you don't know the language or the people. I also miss my family, and get a little sad when I miss family events or big moments in their lives and can't be there in person. But I've come to realize that life keeps moving — both for them and for me. My motto is: you choose your hard. For me, marriage and raising a child right now would be difficult. For someone else, it might be moving overseas alone without knowing the language. But that's the kind of hard I'd gladly choose any day. Jump to

Title: Platformonomics TGIF #95: August 1, 2025

Read By Platformonomics TGIF is a weekly roll-up of links, comments on those links, and perhaps a little too much tugging on my favorite threads. Type your email… Subscribe Quarterly CAPEX week, plus updates from a bunch of our favorite recurring characters! This has to be the high point of your Hot (Mess of an Epstein Coverup) Summer! Buckle up, as we have a lot this week! Coin flip whether I write next week. The four hyperCAPEX companies spent $96.78 billion on CAPEX, up 25% from Q1 and up 65% from a year ago. Nearly 12 digits. In a quarter. The usual caveat: this is overwhelmingly cloud/AI spend except for Amazon which also spends on warehouses, trucks, satellite constellations, etc. AWS was 61% of Amazon’s CAPEX spend in calendar 2024 (they don’t break out quarterly), so the AWS Q2 spend was probably on par with Google and Microsoft ($20B+). UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 The companies remain supply-constrained, and are starting to highlight ballooning depreciation costs on the horizon, which will impact earnings. And the useful life of cutting edge GPUs remains unknown. Previous: Big CAPEX Scoreboard – Q1 2025, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q4 2024, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q3 2024, Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes 2024 Retrospective Related: AI capex may be ~2% of US GDP in 2025, SPV Financing Risks Amazon-wide CAPEX was $33.32 billion, up 32% for the quarter, up 85% for the year. Amazon gave no specific breakdown of their CAPEX other than saying it was “primarily” for AWS, so we’ll assume AWS CAPEX was ~60% of the total. UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 Despite beating on both revenue and earnings, the market didn’t like Amazon’s guidance and/or AI positioning. “It is early days…” blah blah blah “…it is early days” didn’t compel. This the first time I can recall that the FinTwit mob going after CEO and AWS AI product manager Andy Jassy. Time for a Polymarket bet on whether Bezos returns as CEO? CAPEX: Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31,400,000,000 in q two. AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon like Tranium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve by investing in same day delivery facilities as well as robotics and automation. Supply constraints: You know, as I mentioned, well, we have more demand than we have capacity at this point. And I think that and and you see, you know, some of the constraints, and they kind of exist in multiple places. The single biggest constraint is power. But I you know, you also see constraints off and on with chips and then some of the components that, you know, once you have the chips to actually make the servers, you know, you there are you know, sometimes you have new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they’re supposed to be and sometimes you get the chips and, you know, the yield you get in making servers isn’t what you what you expect when you get to ramp. Guidance: We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year. Depreciation: AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense as well as unfavorable impacts from year over year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments in capital expenditures in AWS. As we’ve said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers, and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI. “Early Days”: Question: So there is a Wall Street Finance person narrative right now that AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss to peers, etcetera. Can you just sort of address that? What what is your rebuttal to that? So on on the first one around AI, the first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. <six paragraphs of platitudes> I still think it’s very early days in AI and in terms of adoption. Such a missed opportunity to let us know exactly how many steps we now are into the AI race. Previous: Amazon CAPEX – Q4 2024, Amazon CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Amazon CAPEX, Q1 Amazon CAPEX, AWS re:Invent Weirdness, The Arc of the Generative AI Universe Bends Towards Cash: Anthropic Edition, Culture Clash Conjecture: Amazon and Anthropic, Amazon Even More Bullish on Finding a Compression Algorithm for Experience, 326 Features into a 10k Race, Existential Corner: How Many Steps into the 10K are We?, Team Primitives: What Sayest Thou?, Amazon Desperately Seeks Compression Algorithm for Experience, Most Greatest AI Company in Entire Universe Makes Major Strategy Pivot, SEC Embraces Platformonomics ClownWatch™, Warns Amazon and IBM, The AWS Generative AI Soap Opera, The Amazon AI Inferiority Complex $22.45 billion, up 31% from Q1, up 70% from a year ago. Google is ramping CAPEX nicely, but it has taken awhile (and Google had skimped on CAPEX for a few years before the AI boom). Data centers: We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. CAPEX: With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure, with approximately two-thirds of investments in servers and one-third in data centers and networking equipment. Supply constraints: While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments, we expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that’s a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you’re seeing now is investments we made some time ago that’s now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. Guidance: Moving to investments, given the strong demand for our Cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet Cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we’re seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. Depreciation: In terms of expenses. First, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Previous: Google CAPEX – Q4 2024, Google CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Google CAPEX, Q1 Google CAPEX $17.01 billion, up 25% from Q1, up 100% from a year ago. Despite being the runt of the hyperCAPEX litter, Meta is currently by far the most entertaining of the bunch to watch, as we try to match their ambitions to their capabilities. No Big Tech company oscillates more in perception between future dominance and doomed roadkill than Meta. They’re already into their second AI cycle, as they take a mulligan and do a complete restart. So many interesting paradoxes. If you throw enough money around on a restart, maybe no one will ask why the last effort went awry? Why does the company need to create a new organization “unencumbered by the bureaucracy of the $1.8tn company“? Personal superintelligence sounds great, but why would anyone trust them to run it? (Apple so much better positioned, but, alas, execution issues). Putting datacenters in tents? In hurricane country? As the hyperCAPEX runt, how exactly does Meta plan to “have the largest compute fleet of any company“? (don’t make me publish the cumulative CAPEX chart yet again). And where will they get the power? CAPEX: Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $17.0 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Guidance: Turning now to the capex outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capex dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in ‘26 will be scaling GenAI capacity as we build out training capacity that’s going to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next year. So at present, we’re not really thinking about external use cases on the infrastructure, but I’d say it’s a good question. Depreciation (may be optimistic on deprec schedules – CHAOS) That’s driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and placed in service in ‘26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that we’ll recognize a full year of depreciation next year. While we’re still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025 and ‘26 than it has been in prior years. Financing CAPEX: …on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing CapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share of that ourselves, but we’re also exploring ways to work with financial partners to codevelop data centers. We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many different paths Previous: Meta CAPEX – Q1 2025, Meta CAPEX – Q4 2024, Meta CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Meta CAPEX, Q1 Meta CAPEX, CAPEX Clues: Enter LlamaGate, Meta AI: Founder Mode or “Win Now” Mode?, Is This Founder Mode?

It’s the Copy Button., Remember the Metaverse? $24.2 billion for the quarter, up 13% from Q1, up 27% from a year ago. Satya “I’m good for my $80 billion” Nadella in fact spent $88.2 billion in the promised fiscal year. Data centers: We opened new DCs across six continents, and now have over 400 datacenters across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. We stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our owned datacenter capacity faster than any other competitor. Demand: And, while we brought additional datacenter capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. CAPEX: Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for P, P, and E, was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half of our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Guidance: Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more datacenter capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year.

The “hipster antitrust” movement has been hugely influential in recent years, despite lacking any kind of an intellectual model for antitrust beyond shouting “break them up”. You can argue these hipsters helped drive Silicon Valley into Trump’s arms, amongst other consequences. Lately the hipsters have been vociferous in their opposition to the Abundance book and movement, which takes the radical position that governments should try to make their policies actually work. Abundance author Derek Thompson decided to dig into the hipsters’ criticisms: The sharpest criticisms of the book Abundance have sometimes come from the antitrust movement. This group, mostly on the left, insists that the biggest problems in America typically come from monopolies and the corruption of big business. I’m not an economist or a lawyer. I’m just a journalist. To the extent that I’m good at anything, it’s calling people on the phone and writing down what they say. So I reached out to the primary sources that Musharbash quotes throughout the piece. What I found was astonishing. The economist Musharbash cites told me that his theories had been misapplied. The housing analysts quoted in the piece told me Musharbash distorted their points and reached dubious, or even flatly wrong, conclusions. The leading monopoly researcher I spoke to, whose work has been celebrated by the antitrust left, told me that the entire thrust of the article—and, by extension, much of the antitrust-housing philosophy—defied sophisticated antitrust analysis. The essay you’re reading is very long. But I can sum it up in one sentence: The Musharbash essay on Dallas—like too much of the antitrust left’s work on housing—is filled with out-of-context quotes, overconfident assertions lacking evidence, and generally misguided claims. The subsequent online discourse has been hilarious. And the hipsters have responded with insults and unsubstantiated claims, but no effort to refute the specifics.

Title: Microsoft tops $4T in valuation — great news for the company, not so great for its workers

If you own Microsoft stock, you’ve got to be happy. Microsoft’s latest financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 were robust: Revenue reached $76.4 billion (up 18% year-over-year), with net income at $27.2 billion (up 24%). The primary driver was robust growth in Microsoft’s cloud and AI businesses. Azure’s revenue, which has finally been separated out in the financial reporting, now stands at $75 billion in annual revenue, representing a 34% surge for the year. Put it all together, and you can see why Microsoft has joined Nvidia in the $4-trillion valuation club. So much for the good news. Despite those impressive financials, Microsoft has laid off a substantial number of employees this year — about 25,000, to be exact, including roughly 9,100 in July alone (approximately 4% of its workforce). The layoffs have affected a broad range of divisions, including Xbox, engineering, and management layers. What’s driving these cuts is clearly not poor performance. Instead, Microsoft is betting that its aggressive $80 billion AI investments will pay off. Don’t take my word for it: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently noted the “incongruence” of laying off employees even as Microsoft is “thriving.” He called this dynamic “the enigma of success” in a tech industry where progress demands constant change, even when things are going well. “I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left,” he added. “Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.” I’m sure deep gratitude will help keep a roof over their heads. Microsoft is far from alone in dumping once-valued employees for cheaper AI alternatives. IBM has cut 8,000 jobs so far this year. In particular, IBM is gradually replacing clerical jobs with AI, while its AskHR bot has taken over much of HR’s old workloads. At the same time, Meta is reducing its staff by 5% in 2025 as it switches gears from its metaverse dud to AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put an even finer point on where things are headed. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done.” That means, he said, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” This isn’t just happening in the US. In India, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has cut 12,000 jobs this year. Why? Because its customers are moving to AI, which has sharply cut the outsourcing work the company has historically profited from. Meanwhile, in Japan, Indeed and Glassdoor’s parent company has laid off 1,300 workers, approximately 6% of its workforce, according to CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba. “AI is changing the world,” he said. It certainly changed the world of the 130,000 or so tech jobs that have been lost this year, according to estimates by The Bridge Chronicle. Oh, and by the way, Indeed reports that tech job postings in July were down 36% from their early 2020 levels. Is this a great time to be looking for a tech job or what!? But for every fantasy job, like the $100-million AI jobs Meta is supposedly offering, there are hundreds of tech workers who have kissed their six-figure positions goodbye and thousands of clerical staffers who will no longer be making five-figure annual incomes. There’s one little problem with all these job cuts. We still don’t know whether AI can deliver the work goods. Sure, some jobs, such as repetitive HR or call-center work, can be largely replaced. Heck, we’ve seen that happen before. I remember when many call-center jobs were located in the US — before companies figured out that outsourcing such jobs to low-cost countries was cheaper. For jobs like these, AI is just the next step in cost-cutting. Companies often use AI like that — to cut costs. Not many are using it to help good workers become great workers. Instead, CEOs are buying the illusion that AI can magically replace highly skilled workers. I hate to break it to you: It can’t. Take programming. According to the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 84% of programmers now use or plan to use AI tools in their workflow. However — and this is a crucial point — 46% of AI-using developers don’t trust AI results. In fact, even as AI developer tools have supposedly improved, programmers are trusting them even less. Why? Because they’re spending a lot of their time fixing AI mistakes. AI programming tools make fine interns, but they’re not senior or even mid-level developers. Let’s also remember that in the last few weeks, Replit, the leading vibe-coding company, which promises to make “software creation accessible to everyone, entirely through natural language,” wrecked a production database for a senior tech executive who was trying, and spectacularly failing, to build a new application. The bottom line is that AI is not good enough, not yet anyway, to replace engineers and developers. This will come back and bite companies like Microsoft in the rump. Sure, the market loves companies that cut costs. But if AI doesn’t deliver on its promises, getting all those experienced ex-workers back in the foldwon’t be easy. Today, AI is great for getting people to believe that groups of bunnies love hopping on trampolines; but doing hard technical work? That’s another question entirely. Steven J.

Title: 9 things you shouldn't use AI for at work

A few weeks ago, I shared with you "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why." It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day. Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of "when not to use an AI" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think. Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right) "Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets," said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies. "That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point." To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong. Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work. This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal. Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use) This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU. Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else. Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen. Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice. Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog. Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time. You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer. As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns. Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court. Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: "There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you." She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: "It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you." While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance. Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't. Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know. Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice. Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear? When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity. Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines "plagiarize" as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own," and to "use (another's production) without crediting the source." The dictionary also defines plagiarize as "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does "present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source." Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin. Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job. The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck. It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too. According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI "to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%)." "Why are you firing me?" "It's not my fault. The AI made me do it." Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive. If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies. We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk. But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media). Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost. Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say. Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed. Earlier, I wrote "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI," which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance. But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring. In "Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster," my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase. It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award. Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount: What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the summer holidays have arrived but it’s been a busy old week, and Max Goldbart is here to guide you through. After today, we’re going to take a little August break from both the International Insider newsletter and our Global Breakouts strand, but we will be back with you early September. In the meantime, our crack team will bring you the very latest news and analysis, day in, day out. For now, read on or sign up here. WBD & Paramount Reorgs Hit International Seismic shifts: We at Deadline International like to be on hand to tease out how major changes in the American media landscape impact international. What better week than when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) set out its post-split leadership team and the protracted Paramount-Skydance merger moved to its next phase. WBD is forging a streaming and studios Warner Bros. division under David Zaslav, which will be distinct from the Discovery Global networks division led by ex-WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. International, for the most part, has moved under Wiedenfels, with ex-WBD Lat Am boss Fernando Medin taking on the President of International role and his sort-of predecessor Gerhard Zeiler effectively promoted to become President of Discovery Global in the U.S., UK and Germany. Yet the announcement was devoid of information about the Warner Bros. International TV Production studio, which has bases in multiple countries and makes some of Warner’s biggest unscripted hits around the world. Rather than being folded in with the rest of the American Warner studios, WBITVP will in fact become part of Discovery Global, we revealed Tuesday. There was speculation that there was a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit, but the latter ended up making the most sense due in part to WBITVP boss Ronald Goes’ relationship with Zeiler, who has a keen understanding of international production. So far, WBITVP employees are hopeful the split won’t lead to layoffs, which has been a concern for those working at rival Paramount’s international assets around the world as the $8.4B Paramount-Skydance merger completes. Staffers at Paramount-owned UK network Channel 5 are said to be “anxious” about what comes next. Deadline went deep to reveal more of these concerns. Change is coming in America, and as ever it’s spreading overseas. Related Stories Executives Top TV Executive Nina L. Diaz To Depart Paramount When Skydance Merger Is Completed: "I'm Incredibly Proud Of What We've Built" Executives Tom Ryan Departing As President & CEO Of Paramount Streaming As Skydance Sets New Team UK Agency Shakeup Watch on Deadline Exodus: Big shakeup in the UK agenting space this week with a whopping four out of five partners at Hamilton Hodell moving to management firm B-Side. This represents a serious exodus of senior agents. Alexander Cooke, Madeleine Dewhirst, Christopher Farrar and Sian Smyth are all joining the leadership team at B-Side from today (August 1), taking huge stars including Naomi Ackie, Aaron Pierre, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Wilde, Leo Woodall, Anthony Boyle, Lola Petticrew, Martin Compston and Camille Cottin with them. B-Side, which already reps the likes of Daniel Kaluuya and Barry Keoghan, is no stranger to ship-jumping, having been launched four years ago by four former Troika reps who kicked off with an impressive client list. The move is just the latest to shake up the ever-bustling UK agenting space, which has been alive and busy since the UTA acquisition of Curtis Brown. It provides a reminder of the power of British talent. For now, Hamilton Hodell stays strong with at least half a dozen agents remaining with mega talent such as Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw and Emma Thompson. “I’m very proud of my brilliant team of agents, associates and support staff at HH and we will continue to provide the very best representation for extraordinary talent,” said CEO Christian Hodell, who has been with the agency for more than three decades. Netflix ❤️ MBC You know what I MENA?: Big moves in the MENA region as Netflix continues its path to world aggregation domination with a landmark deal struck with the Middle East’s MBC Group. The deal, described as “innovative” by those closest to it, will see customers of MBCNOW – MBC’s recently launched entertainment service aggregator – given access to the full Netflix service, alongside MBC’s Shahid streaming channels and linear TV channels, in one subscription. Netflix already performs well in the region but simultaneously faces stiff competition from Shahid, so this feels a case of, ‘If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.’ The streamer has spent recent weeks unveiling these kinds of deal around the world, including the landmark TF1 tie-up, and so it appears that local aggregation now matters as much to Netflix as local commissioning. On the latter, Netflix yesterday unveiled a 10-strong slate in another priority region, Colombia, including a documentary about soccer superstar James Rodríguez. The streamer has pushed heavily into Latin American programming with the One Hundred Years of Solitude adaptation being its biggest effort out of Colombia to date. Can’t Escape YouTube Even the boomers love it: Ofcom’s Media Nations report spotlighting the UK TV industry’s previous 12 months always provides a bounty of talking points and this year all roads led to YouTube. The Google-owned behemoth is all the rage in TV circles and Media Nations unearthed research finding that YouTube is now the second most-watched service in the UK, behind only the BBC and ahead of the likes of ITV and Netflix. While young people no doubt love a bit of YouTube, interesting findings included a doubling of viewing from over-55s, most of which takes place on smart TV sets rather than phones. Half of the platform’s top-trending videos now more closely resemble traditional TV, including long-form interviews and game shows, Ofcom said. Chatter about how traditional broadcasters and super-indies can best leverage YouTube rather than bowing to its power will likely dominate over coming months. Upon the announcement of its half-year results, Big Brother super-producer Banijay Entertainment touted plans to “enhance our presence on YouTube specifically.” It’s not been all roses for YouTube this week, however, with Australia’s Prime Minister revealing he officially wants to include YouTube in the nation’s world-first social media ban for under 16s. Google, in response, has warned the Australian government that it could go down the legal route. Mubi Investor In Spotlight “Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no”: Mubi has in recent years nurtured a reputation for being an independent auteurs’ dream, but the distributor has been in the spotlight these past days for altogether different reasons. In fact, it has angered several such auteurs. On Wednesday, Mubi received pushback from a number of filmmakers with connections to the distributor – including Radu Jude, Sarah Friedland, Joshua Oppenheimer and Cherien Dabis – over a recent $100M investment it received from Silicon Valley-based private equity firm Sequoia Capital. The issue stems from Sequoia having backed a number of Israeli military technology companies since October 7. The filmmakers suggested these investments tied Mubi to the ongoing violence in Gaza, where more than 60,000 people are reported to have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign. Things got worse for Mubi when one of the letter’s supporters, Eddie Huang, said Mubi had shelved his latest project over his criticism of ties to Sequoia. “I know I did the right thing,” said Huang. “I’m not gonna be gaslit into thinking I didn’t. Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no.” Responding, Mubi has said the Sequoia partnership is there “to accelerate” its “mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences,” while noting Sequoia’s investments do “not reflect the views of Mubi.” The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: The name’s Knight… Steven Knight has been set to pen the next James Bond movie, a “bucket list” achievement. 🌶️ Another One: Der Tiger has become the first Amazon MGM Studios Germany feature to land a local theatrical release. 🌶️ More: House of the Dragon S3 has cast Red Skies star Annie Shapero as fierce warrior Alysanne Blackwood. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Gurinder Chadha is penning a sequel to 1990s cult hit Bend it Like Beckham. 🫵 Accused: Christopher Nolan has been criticized for shooting elements of all-star epic The Odyssey in the Morocco-occupied Western Sahara. 📊 Results: In half-year earnings week, Canal+ revenue fell 3.3%, TF1 was helped along by its North American studio and ProSiebenSat. 1 was hit by economic uncertainty. 🚪 Exiting: Good Morning Britain U.S. correspondent Noel Phillips amid job cuts. 🤝 Done deal: My Octopus Teacher maker Off the Fence has been rescued from bankruptcy by Insight TV. 🏆Oscars: The International feature contest 2026 is ago with Turkey’s One of the Days When Hemme Dies from Murat Fıratoğlu. 🤖 Robots are coming: Korea’s Culture Minister nominee said he wants to better integrate AI technology into the industry. 🏕️ Festival latest: Pedro Almodóvar collaborator Esther García will be feted at San Sebastian. 🍿 Box office: Sara told us Indian Box Office hit Saiyaara has defied the odds to become the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year. 🎥 Trailer: For The Birthday Party, the Willem Dafoe-led drama headed to Locarno.

Title: Pam Bondi: Who is Trump’s attorney general handling the Epstein files?
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/31/pam-bondi-who-is-trumps-attorney-general-handling-the-epstein-files
Time Published: 2025-07-31T16:37:32Z
Full Content:
The former Florida top cop has embraced loyalty to Trump, but faces fallout from the MAGA base over Epstein files. United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has emerged as one of the most embattled top officials in the administration of United States President Donald Trump, amid fallout over her handling of disclosures related to the sex trafficking case of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has so far stood by Bondi, who has been instrumental in his reshaping of the Department of Justice, but the president has continued to voice frustration that public fixation on the scandal – and criticism from both within his base and among his opponents – has refused to die down. Democrats have adopted the issue as their latest political cudgel, while Republicans in Congress have promised to continue their own probe when they return from summer recess, with plans to hear testimony from Bondi, as well as subpoena the case files and testimony from Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. Two lawmakers are even pushing a bill that would compel Bondi to release the documents in question, a move Republican Thomas Massie has said is aimed at “justice for the victims and transparency for Americans”. So who is Bondi and how did the 59-year-old attorney general come to be one of Trump’s most loyal cabinet members? Bondi spent 18 years as a public prosecutor in Hillsborough County, Florida before breaking into statewide office. The lengthy career gave her more direct prosecutorial experience than any preceding US attorney general, according to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative group that has had an outsized role in shaping the policy of Trump’s second term. Speaking last year to the Tampa Bay Times, former colleagues recounted Bondi’s reputation for jury-turning charisma that saw her quickly rise through the ranks of felony prosecutions. But it was regular media appearances as a legal analyst on national news networks that helped her to build public recognition, which was credited with her victory in Florida’s open attorney general race in 2010. Bondi, who took office in 2011, was also buoyed by the endorsement of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. As attorney general, Bondi led crusades against so-called “pill mills”, clinics that loosely prescribe pain medications, while leading some Republican pet causes, including a multi-state effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. She also led efforts to uphold Florida’s ban on same sex marriage, before its nationwide legalisation by Supreme Court order in 2015, as well as the ability for same sex couples to adopt. During that period, Bondi sought to establish herself as a champion against sex trafficking and child sex abuse, launching the state’s council on human trafficking and an investigation into past abuse by Catholic priests. As Florida’s top cop, she also had her first brush with Epstein, with critics accusing her of remaining willfully silent on a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein and his co-conspirators had struck with her predecessor. They have said Bondi could have intervened as victims launched lawsuits challenging the deal, which saw Epstein plead guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution but serve only months in prison. “But Bondi kept her distance from the state’s most prominent sex-trafficking case, even as Epstein’s victims pleaded with the courts to invalidate provisions of his non-prosecution agreement and filed lawsuits alleging he abused them when he was on work release from jail,” wrote Mary Ellen Klas, a Bloomberg opinion writer and former Miami Herald Bureau Chief. “Her inaction helped to perpetuate what victims describe as a government cover-up that, along with Epstein’s death, has robbed those victims of their chance to get answers and hold their abusers to account,” she wrote. Bondi’s connections with Trump drew scrutiny even before he entered office, after it was revealed in 2016 that authorities had launched an ethics probe related to the soon-to-be president. At question was whether Bondi had solicited contributions from Trump in 2013, as her office was weighing joining a lawsuit against Trump University. Her office denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation was later dropped. Despite those early contacts, Bondi was not an early adherent to Trump’s presidential ambitions or his nascent “Make America Great Again” movement. Instead, she initially supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary. When Jeb dropped out of the race, she threw her lot in with Trump. From there, things accelerated quickly. While still Florida’s attorney general, Bondi served on Trump’s first White House transition team. She left her post in Florida in 2019 and soon joined the Ballard Lobbyist group, representing the interests of Amazon, General Motors, and Uber, among others. From there, she joined the White House legal team, defending the president during his first impeachment trial in the US Senate, in which Trump was accused of conditioning weapons to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on then political opponent Biden. After Trump’s election loss, Bondi was among those spearheading unfounded claims that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. She helped coordinate former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s infamous news conference at the Four Seasons Landscaping in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she flatly and falsely claimed that Trump had “won Pennsylvania”. She went on to chair the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a pro-Trump think tank that oversaw “a series of concerning lawsuits in recent years, particularly in the voting rights and elections arena”, as described by the Brennan Center for Justice. Publicly, she also floated prosecuting career federal law enforcement officials who investigated Trump. In criticising her appointment, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in January said that Bondi had “the ultimate qualification” to be Trump’s attorney general: “loyalty”. That loyalty has generated much consternation since Bondi took office, with opponents accusing her of shaping the country’s top law enforcement agency in Trump’s likeness. That has included hundreds of layoffs at the department, including investigators and prosecutors in the two federal criminal cases lodged against Trump before his November election victory last year. She has also launched a task force to probe those investigations, while publicly decrying what she has framed as a conspiracy against Trump amid the career staff, saying the staff of the FBI and Justice Department were rife with employees “who despise Donald Trump, despise us”, as she told Fox News. More recently, she launched a strike force to investigate how the intelligence community, under former President Obama, handled information related to Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, in what some have seen as an attempt to distract from the Epstein imbroglio. She has also announced a misconduct complaint against federal Judge James Boasberg, escalating a standoff over judges who have ruled against Trump’s early actions, most notably his use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members with little requirement for proof. But it was Bondi’s embrace of theories pushed by Trump’s staunchest supporters that has landed her in the current predicament. In February, she brazenly told Fox News that she had Epstein’s long-sought “client list” – thought to contain the names of the powerful figures the billionaire blackmailed via his sex scheme – “sitting on my desk right now”. Months later, the White House would say Bondi was referring to the entirety of Epstein’s case files, and not specifically the list long sought by MAGA’s most influential voices. That came shortly after the Justice Department in July released a memo, stating flatly: “This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list'”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-personal-superintelligence-dream-leaves-much-to-the-imagination/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T16:17:54Z

Another day, another vague reference to the promise of superintelligence. On Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a video address and accompanying letter on X stating his company's "vision for the future of personal superintelligence for everyone." Also: How Meta's new AI chatbot could strike up a conversation with you Zuckerberg coined that term -- without actually defining it -- earlier this month, when Meta announced its new Superintelligence Labs, a division within the company dedicated to building a computer system that significantly surpasses human capability. Superintelligence would leapfrog artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would be theoretically comparable to the human brain. Both remain deeply hypothetical. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction In the letter, Zuckerberg references recent advancements in agentic AI, noting that systems are slowly but surely "improving themselves," and claims that superintelligence is more possible than ever -- something we've heard before. Still, for every advancement, there is usually a limitation. "As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be," writes Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's message refrains from clarifying what a personal AI product or service could be. Regardless, he is optimistic it will free the industry from the automation trap. "If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting," he says. It's unclear whether that trend has actually begun, though, considering how Jevon's Paradox -- the theory that efficiency only begets more consumption, not freedom -- appears to be playing out. Also: I've worn the Meta Ray-Bans for half a year, and these 5 features still amaze me "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," his letter continues. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." The Information reported on Monday that Meta's smart glasses sales have more than tripled in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Perhaps for good reason; ZDNET senior AI editor Sabrina Ortiz recently noted in our AI newsletter that smart glasses are, in her opinion, the most successful vehicle for effective personal AI. Amidst the optimism, Zuckerberg noted the already-present reality that AI will disrupt many parts of society, including the job market -- and that how we'll apply superintelligence remains to be seen (if or when it is realized). "The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society," he writes. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking Zuckerberg's vision expands on the current argument for why AI agents are useful. At their most efficient, agents take up the busywork that can claim much of a human worker's day, automating the mundane so employees can focus on higher-level, more singular contributions. That's precisely because agents are broadly less capable than humans, especially when it comes to tasks like original creative work, relationship management, negotiation, and understanding certain contexts. But the whole premise of superintelligence is that it would far exceed what the human brain can do. How Zuckerberg maintains this is possible while also assuring it would not displace people themselves will remain logically opaque until we have concrete examples. Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon This feels especially relevant in the context of work, where AI's agentic impact is unsettling job security. Microsoft just completed a third round of layoffs this year, ostensibly thanks to AI, and policy has yet to specify worker protections for those at risk of being replaced by the technology, instead favoring tax breaks for upskilling initiatives. Meta itself is in the process of laying off 5% of its workforce this year, following 21,000 total layoffs since 2022, according to Business Insider. As is the case at other companies, the layoffs are at least partially due to redirecting funds into AI development. It's unclear whether these roles at Meta will eventually also be replaced by AI. In what could be seen as a strategic investment plea, Zuckerberg assured the public that, despite offering no specifics, Meta can be trusted with the huge responsibility of shepherding whatever "personal superintelligence" is toward humanity's best interests -- unlike other AI companies. "We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives," his letter says, noting that Meta is "distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output." "At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture," he says. Also: Control your computer with your mind? Meta's working on that It's unclear how this approach to a still-unrealized power will fit with the company's past business decisions. In April, for example, Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, formerly the company's director of global policy, testified that Meta shared data with advertisers about when users, including teens, felt most "worthless or helpless." While double-speak isn't surprising coming from the world's most powerful CEOs, Zuckerberg's message is a worthwhile reminder that, in their relatively brief history, tech companies have yet to commit their technology to the betterment of the human condition over profits. In carefully promising nothing but asking for the public's trust, the message leaves uncertain who Zuckerberg's idealized future is particularly for -- especially in an increasingly deregulated policy environment. Also: Trump's AI plan pushes AI upskilling instead of worker protections - and 4 other key takeaways In the meantime, the AI agents we have today support tasks like studying and exam prep, coding, turning notes into video, perfecting images, and more.

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A new report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report released this month that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, says Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said that every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in May. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The healthcare sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized that even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, tells Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson says. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in May. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The healthcare sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized that even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, tells Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson says. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Only two companies have ever reached that size. By Eddie Makuch on July 31, 2025 at 7:52AM PDT Microsoft achieved a $4 trillion market cap, becoming just the second company ever to reach that valuation. Microsoft is now the No. 2 most valuable company on the planet, trailing only Nvidia. The climbing valuation comes just after Microsoft laid off 9,000+ people, including major cuts at Xbox. Microsoft reported earnings on Wednesday, and the company beat expectations. The company's stock price jumped after that, helping push Microsoft's total valuation above $4 trillion. The stock price has since cooled off, dropping Microsoft back below $4 trillion but still ranking No. 2 overall. Microsoft is currently trading at around $538 per share, which is up 28% year-to-date and up 163% over the past five years. The top five companies on the planet ranked by market cap include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, in that order. Microsoft brought in revenue of $76.4 billion for the quarter that ended June 30, along with a profit of $27.2 billion. For the Xbox business, Microsoft reported that annual Game Pass revenue reached nearly $5 billion for the first time, with 50 million people trying Black Ops 6. Additionally, Microsoft said Xbox had 500 million monthly active users across all platforms, covering console, PC, mobile, and more. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an earnings call that Microsoft is the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. Newly published US video game sales data showed that Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts. Looking ahead, Microsoft plans to invest even more in AI infrastructure and technology than before, with Microsoft upping its planned investment from $80 billion to $120 billion. Nadella acknowledged in a memo to staff that people may wonder why Microsoft is laying off thousands of people as its business thrives. He said, "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." For Xbox, Microsoft's cuts included not only layoffs but game cancellations and the closure of at least one studio. See the gallery below to learn more about the extent of the cuts.

Title: Wall Street poised to open higher, boosted by strong earnings from AI-focused technology sector

By DAMIAN J. TROISE and ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writers Stocks capped a choppy day of trading on Wall Street with more losses Thursday after an early big tech rally faded and a health care sector pullback led the market lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, its third straight decline. The benchmark index, which is just below the record high it set on Monday, notched a 2.2% gain for the month of July and is up 7.8% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% lower. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 lost ground, with health care companies accounting for the biggest drag on the market. Health care stocks sank after the White House released letters asking big pharmaceutical companies to cut prices and make other changes in the next 60 days. Eli Lilly & Co. fell 2.6%, UnitedHealth Group slid 6.2% and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 5.8%. Gains by some big technology stocks with hefty values helped temper the impact of the broader market’s decline. Meta Platforms surged 11.3% after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram crushed Wall Street’s sales and profit targets even as the company continues to pour billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. Microsoft climbed 3.9% after posting better results than analysts expected. The software pioneer also gave investors an encouraging update on its Azure cloud computing platform, which is a centerpiece of the company’s artificial intelligence efforts. Big Tech companies have regularly been the driving force behind much of the market’s gains over enthusiasm for the future of artificial intelligence. Elsewhere in the market, design software company Figma soared in its stock market debut. The stock vaulted 250% above its initial public offering price of $33 a share. All told, the S&P 500 fell 23.51 points to 6,339.39. The Dow dropped 330.30 points to 44,130.98, and the Nasdaq gave up 7.23 points to finish at 21,122.45. Earnings remain a key focus outside of the technology sector in what has been a heavy week so far for corporate financial results. CVS Health fell 0.3% after it topped Wall Street expectations for the second quarter and raised its full-year forecast again. In economic news, the Commerce Department said prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index. That’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure for inflation. The latest reading was slightly higher than economists expected and also marks an increase from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Results from another measure of inflation earlier this month, the consumer price index, also showed inflation rising in June. Also on Thursday, a report showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits inched up last week. The latest updates on inflation and the jobs market are landing amid lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs. Inflation’s temperature is being closely monitored by businesses and the Fed to better gauge the impact of President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again approach to import taxes. Companies including Ford and Hershey’s have more recently warned that tariffs are weighing on their latest and projected financial results. Trump has said he will levy tariffs against goods from dozens of countries if they don’t reach agreements with the U.S. by Friday. The latest developments in the seemingly unpredictable tariff landscape include a potential pause in tariff escalations with China and a deal with South Korea. However, Trump said Thursday that he would enter a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico over trade as 25% tariff rates stay in place. The reasons behind trade policy decisions remain unpredictable. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil. He has directly linked the import tax to the trial of his ally, the country’s former president Jair Bolsonaro. He has also said that trade negotiations with Canada would be more difficult in the wake of that nation’s economically unrelated decision to recognize a Palestinian state. Uncertainty over tariffs and inflation have prompted the Fed to leave its benchmark interest rate alone through the central bank’s past five meetings, including the one that ended Wednesday. The Fed has been trying to cool the rate of inflation back to its target of 2%. It has come close, but inflation remains stubbornly stuck just above that target. A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pressured by Trump to cut the benchmark rate, though that decision isn’t his to make alone, but belongs to the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. “Inflation is only a bit above the Fed’s target, but looks likely to rise in the second half of the year due to tariffs,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “With the job market in pretty good shape, they see room to hold interest rates steady and lean against inflation’s increase near-term.” Wall Street has been tempering their expectations for rate cuts at the Fed’s next meeting in September. Traders now see a 39% chance of a rate cut, according to data from CME Group. That’s down from 58.4% a week ago and a 75.4% chance a month ago. Treasury yields held steady in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 4.37%. The yield on the two-year Treasury remained at 3.94% from late Wednesday. Markets were mostly mixed in Asia and Europe.

Title: Microsoft just revealed how much its flagship cloud platform makes—a whopping $75 billion a year

Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn’t disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant’s end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company’s quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft’s ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven’t changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn’t disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the “volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
