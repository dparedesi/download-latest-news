For fans dreaming of returning to Middle-earth in a new, next-gen adventure, the news isn’t good. Amazon’s ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which had been in development since early 2023, has reportedly been cancelled. The project was meant to bring players back into Tolkien’s world with a fresh, modern spin, but development apparently stopped in October 2025. The report comes from Bloomberg, which revealed that Amazon began cutting roughly 14,000 jobs across the company in late October. Among those affected were many employees from Amazon Games, the publisher behind the long-awaited Lord of the Rings MMO. The cuts hit multiple divisions, but one key detail came from Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer, who confirmed on LinkedIn that she was among those laid off—and that the Middle-earth project was shelved. Amrine shared a bittersweet note: “Y’all would have loved it.” Amazon Games has been around since 2012, focusing primarily on publishing original titles. That focus seems to be shifting. In a memo released on October 28, 2025, the company cited “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games and outlined plans to concentrate more on its cloud gaming platform, Luna. The service primarily hosts existing titles, meaning fewer in-house game developments like the cancelled Lord of the Rings MMORPG. Despite the major shakeup, Amazon Games will continue work on March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider title, and other “casual and AI-focused games.” Still, losing such a massive and promising project sucks, not just for Amazon’s team, but for fans of Tolkien’s world who’ve been waiting for a new multiplayer experience since The Lord of the Rings Online launched back in 2007. That game, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, remains beloved but very dated by today’s standards. The cancelled MMO could have been the perfect way to bring players back to a living, breathing Middle-earth with updated visuals, gameplay, and storytelling inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings novels. The cancellation is a lost opportunity for synergy. With Amazon already heavily invested in Tolkien’s universe through The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the MMORPG could have expanded on that world, offering fans a chance to explore events from before the Third Age—when Sauron’s power still loomed large and the One Ring had yet to be destroyed in Mount Doom. Unfortunately, that vision won’t be realized anytime soon. While there are still plenty of older Lord of the Rings games to revisit, it may be a long wait before another studio takes up the challenge of creating a new MMORPG set in Middle-earth. For now, it’s a somber end to what could have been a truly epic return to one of fantasy’s most iconic worlds.

Title: AI Companies Are Treating Their Workers Like Human Garbage, Which May Be a Sign of Things to Come for the Rest of Us

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 16, 2025 9:00 AM EST In today’s economy, tech companies are red hot. In fact, the companies burning cash on AI seem to be some of the only ones having a truly great time, as the corporate rate of profit plummets throughout the US and recession fears loom. Though one economist estimates tech companies accounted for 92 percent of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025, you wouldn’t know it by looking at their staff rosters — which seem to be plummeting at an alarming rate. Amazon, for example, recently laid off 14,000 corporate employees, despite posting billions in profits across numerous lines of business. Across the month of October, tech workers made up the highest number of layoffs in any industry, leading the charge in one of the worst single months for furloughs since 2003. That’s bad news, of course, but it also directly contradicts the AI industry’s promises of — in the words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — ushering in “a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet.” Sadly, as Business Insider reports, the bloodbath is far from over. On Tuesday, the AI grading company Mercor — which has massive contracts with corporations like OpenAI and Anthropic — suddenly announced it was shuttering a huge project with Meta, leaving workers scrambling. The Meta Project, called Musen, employed some 5,000 data labelers at its peak, and was previously expected to last until at least 2026, according to BI. “They kept stressing how happy the client was and how it got extended until the end of the year,” one contractor told the publication. “So to then do this major switch up before the holidays took everyone by surprise.” Luckily for those workers, Mercor is offering to hire them back — just not for Musen. Instead, they’ll have the opportunity work on an extremely similar project named “Nova.” The main difference, it seems, is the wage offered: while Musen’s base contract was $21 an hour, Nova’s opens at $16. Two tech workers offered a Nova contract said the offer email explained the difference in pay is due to “steadier task volumes across multimedia content” and “higher hour caps, enabling greater weekly engagement.” In other words, data labelers — who already had a bum deal as stable jobs become temporary contract work — get to work more for less pay. One employee who accepted a contract to work on Nova told BI the work is functionally the same, “but for $5 less an hour.” “It sounds like most of us are in the same boat,” the worker added. “We wanted to boycott this but are not in a financial place to do so. We needed to have the guaranteed income, even if it’s demoralizing.” The whole episode underscores the false promises beneath the AI boom: jobs are being degraded, the number of “freelance workers” is soaring, AI-generated profit is almost nonexistent, and rising tides on Wall Street certainly aren’t raising all boats. If this is how the most powerful companies in the world are treating workers now, why would the AI “utopia,” as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it, be any different? What’s more, if the companies on the cutting edge of a supposed “technological revolution” can’t be expected to take care of their employees, what hope do the rest of us have?

Title: How laid-off Amazon workers are coping with the shock and planning their next career moves

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, "It's about culture." Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate — only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs — and the tough job market — are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well — I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised — but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off.

Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses — mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my résumé. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though — I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, "Why me?" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to

Title: Former ‘Good Morning America’ Host Joan Lunden on Distrust of the Media and AI Deepfakes: ‘A Really Sad State of Affairs’

By Antonio Ferme Joan Lunden, the veteran journalist who co-anchored “Good Morning America” from 1980 to 1997, doesn’t mince her concerns about the current media landscape. “I think it’s a really sad state of affairs that a very big segment of the American population doesn’t know what to believe anymore,” Lunden told Variety earlier this month at 50th anniversary celebration of “GMA.’ “There’s so much fake news, videos, pictures. They don’t know whether it’s really you. That part of it makes me incredibly sad and upset. I don’t know if we can put the toothpaste back in the tube.” Related Stories BBC Apologizes to Trump Over Edited Interview, but Refuses Compensation After President Threatened $1 Billion Lawsuit George Clooney Says It Was a 'Mistake' to Have Kamala Harris Replace Joe Biden in the 2024 Presidential Election: 'She Was Given a Very Tough Ask' While “GMA” remains a reliable ratings performer for ABC, more Americans are now getting their news from social media platforms. About half of Americans say they struggle to tell what’s true or not when they get news, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. That confusion mirrors a broader collapse in trust in both news organizations and social platforms — a decline seen across political parties and age groups. Popular on Variety “I wish somehow we could right that ship,” Lunden said. “But with AI, I think we’re going to see losses of jobs in media, just like we’re seeing them in Amazon and everywhere else.” [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed this year’s extensive layoffs to the company’s increased rollout of ‘generative AI and agents.’] After pausing for a moment, Lunden added, “But you know what? They can’t replace a host sitting there in that chair, saying good morning to you in the morning. There’s nothing that can be said for the chemistry of two people on the air.”Outside of AI-generated deepfakes, Lunden was also quick to acknowledge how she’s benefited from the new technologies ushered in since leaving “GMA” in 1997. She recalls feeling siloed from the audience she once greeted at every sunrise.“The hardest part of leaving was disconnecting from the American audience,” she said. “Because there was no social media, it was truly a disconnect. It kind of freaked me out.” That void was eventually filled when she first logged onto social media and reconnected with her old fans. When Lunden was on air, she had “reams of people [on staff] that did nothing but answer letters,” but the direct connection on social media was on a different level. “Pretty soon I had fifty thousand, sixty thousand followers, and my husband said, ‘You cannot be talking to all those people every day.’” She chuckled, “But boy, I give it a try.” The lively “GMA” celebration at Disney’s New York headquarters united Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan with Joan Lunden and fellow veterans Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. The event followed the previous night’s airing of President Trump’s confrontational “60 Minutes” interview, his first since suing CBS over what he described as an altered version of Kamala Harris’ election-season appearance. The timing underscored the increasingly fraught relationship between politics, the press and the billionaire owners now shaping major media companies. “We obviously know that the major networks are little by little all becoming owned by the richest people in the world,” Lunden said. “We don’t want their opinions and their political viewpoints to seep into our business. But I’m a glass half full kind of girl. I really think that the journalism, as an industry, will be able to stand strong. We’ll still be here ten years from now celebrating the 60th anniversary, and you’ll still be able to ask me any question you want.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Job Prospects for 2026 College Grads to Hit 5-Year Low While Employers Eye AI, Foreign Labor
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/11/14/job-prospects-2026-college-grads-hit-five-year-low-employers-eye-ai-foreign-labor/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T02:52:25Z

The outlook for the college graduating class of 2026 has dimmed sharply as data shows employer hiring plans have stalled, job market ratings have slipped, and workforce competition has intensified due to automation and visa-based labor programs. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, based on data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), employers project the job market for 2026 graduates will be the weakest in half a decade. A survey conducted among 183 companies between August 7 and September 22 found that 51 percent of respondents rated the job market for new graduates as “poor” or “fair,” a sentiment not seen at this level since the COVID-19-era downturn in 2020-21. Only two percent of employers rated the market as “excellent.” The hiring slowdown follows a wave of large-scale layoffs from major employers, including Amazon, UPS, and Verizon — the latter reportedly preparing to cut 15,000 jobs, its largest workforce reduction ever. While overall hiring for 2026 graduates is technically expected to increase by 1.6 percent, that marks a steep drop from earlier projections for the Class of 2025. Historical trends show that spring hiring often falls short of earlier fall estimates. The divergence is reflected in NACE’s year-over-year hiring projections: from a near 30 percent jump in 2022 spring plans compared to 2021, projections have since plummeted, including a contraction for the Class of 2024. According to data from job platform Handshake, full-time job postings in August dropped over 16 percent year-over-year, while applications per job rose 26 percent. Over 60 percent of 2026 graduates surveyed reported pessimism about their career outlooks. Former recruiter Giavanna Vega, who was laid off from Automation Anywhere in 2023, said companies “don’t know where to invest” amid AI uncertainty and tariffs. “They don’t have the training,” she remarked about recent graduates, many of whom are being passed over for roles that are increasingly filled by laid-off mid-career professionals. The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit 4.8 percent in June, the highest in four years and above the national average. New college graduates are now not only competing with each other, but also with recently laid-off workers and foreign graduates entering the U.S. workforce through visa programs. Rising scrutiny of visa programs such as H-1B and OPT (Optional Practical Training) has enabled hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work in U.S. jobs originally intended for American college students. The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has pledged increased enforcement of longstanding visa-related laws to curb what officials describe as the systemic replacement of domestic talent. Eric Sell, a senior lawyer at the DOJ Civil Rights Division, emphasized that the administration is determined to hold companies accountable for how they treat American workers, especially during periods of economic upheaval and rapid technological change. He stressed that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, technological advancement would “never be used as an excuse to forget the workers that built this country,” and he warned that those attempting to exploit chaotic growth for corporate gain “will be held accountable.” Public frustration has been intensifying. A new Cygnal poll finds that 44 percent of likely voters say companies exploit the H-1B system. Among swing voters, 43 percent agree with that assessment. Notably, the backlash against these visa programs is strongest among working-class Americans and voters without a college degree, key electoral constituencies ahead of the 2026 midterms. In 2024 alone, the Biden administration approved work permits for approximately 400,000 foreign college graduates through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program — a 45 percent increase from 2020 levels under President Trump. Former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and other Trump administration officials have warned that programs like OPT are depressing wages and displacing American graduates, particularly in high-demand STEM and business fields. The pipeline from foreign student to U.S. worker also begins at the admissions level. Breitbart News opinion contributor Rich Kaye questioned why taxpayer-funded public universities are increasingly filling seats with international students who later convert F-1 student visas into work permits. “When a public university replaces a Georgia student with an F‑1 student in a high‑demand field,” Kaye wrote, “it increases the pipeline pressure tomorrow for H‑1B allocations in exactly the sectors where Americans could be trained to fill roles.” That pressure is already being felt by recent graduates like Nalin Haley, who told UnHerd that many in his peer group are struggling just to get started. “It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one,” he stated. “I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: The Bubble Teeters

Time Published: 2025-11-14T23:00:52Z

By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 14, 2025 Is the stock market bubble about to burst? It has seemed that way a few times over the past year, but so far each selloff has proved to be a blip on a relentless climb upwards. But now we’re starting to see signs of weakness in the sector that’s driving markets higher: AI/tech. Investors are beginning to digest that there’s simply not enough electricity in America to support endless new data center construction. And all the debt being raised by “hyperscalers” like Oracle and Meta is causing skeptics to question whether ROI will ever materialize. OpenAI’s co-founder/CEO Sam Altman raised eyebrows back on November 2nd when he seemingly had no answer about how he planned to spend $1.4 trillion on infrastructure with around $20 billion in annual revenue (and huge losses). Could this be the beginning stages of a crash? Sure. Alternatively, could it be another bear trap, like we saw in March/April? Also yes. Today we’re going to survey the latest market action, take a worrying look at the health of the American economy, and review ways to hedge for a crash (without necessarily shorting). The Magnificent 7 (Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet/Google, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft) are down around 10% from the highs, on average. A fairly typical correction so far. But second-tier AI/tech plays are taking larger hits. These stocks were red hot just a few months ago: The most speculative sectors of the market have taken a beating over the past few weeks. Whether this drawdown is the start of a crash, or a simple correction remains to be seen. I’m not buying the dip in U.S. tech or broad markets, nor do I plan to anytime soon. But I’m not shorting it in size either. This week I bought a few puts, but they’re very small for now. Just testing the water with some hedges. Eventually the time may come for a more substantial short position, but we’re not there yet. The risk of a “blow-off top” before the bubble pops is still there. My plan hasn’t changed. I’m heavily positioned in precious metals, miners, hard assets, and select emerging markets. With some cash on hand to take advantage of any market dislocations. One of the most concerning signals is seeing the real American economy barely treading water, despite record stock market strength. First up, layoffs are spiking: Source: Charlie Bilello We’re not at 2008 or 2020 levels yet, but the recent pace of layoff announcements is disturbing. And the most recent consumer sentiment survey out of the University of Michigan is hideous. It’s at the second-lowest level in the survey’s history going back to 1952. Source: UMich Consumers are burnt out. Inflation and a weak job market have taken their toll. And if sentiment is this bad during a bubble, what happens if we get a crash and recession? It’s unusual to see sentiment so low with stocks so high. Another sign that all is not well is the fact that the median U.S. homebuyer is now 59 years old. In 1980, that number was 31. Young people are priced out of the housing market. And as the chart below shows, this is having devastating effects on the percentage of 30-year-olds who are both married and homeowners. From 52% in 1950 to 13% today. A shameful indictment of our country’s trajectory. Despite stocks near record highs, all is not well beneath the surface. This is not a market where I want to be in overpriced stocks. I want plenty of exposure to precious metals and miners. And cheap emerging market stocks with fat yields, like Brazil. Of course, I do have some exposure to U.S. markets, mostly through retirement accounts. But during times like these, I want to hedge that exposure with alternative investments. Because when crashes happen, the hottest stocks get hit the hardest. And based on everything I’m seeing, we’re overdue. Remember that in mid-2022, markets were falling sharply. The Nasdaq 100 had dropped about 33% from its highs in late 2021. In November of 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, giving birth to the AI bubble. Since then the Nasdaq 100 is up 130%. AI saved the stock market, for a while at least. If investors begin to lose faith in the AI story, it could spell trouble. When we add in the economic signals above, I’m maintaining a bearish outlook.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces new layoffs, and it's worrying for the next Tomb Raider game

Crystal Dynamics doesn’t seem to be in a good shape. Indeed, yesterday, the studio announced the layoff of just under 30 people on LinkedIn, which is worrying for the upcoming Tomb Raider game. While Tomb Raider fans eagerly await new information about the next title in this franchise, Crystal Dynamics unveiled a rather worrying statement yesterday on LinkedIn: "Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.” And that's not all, because Crystal Dynamics claimed that these layoffs are essential for the future of the studio as well as for optimizing the development of the next Tomb Raider game. However, this situation may seem alarming to some. Indeed, there have already been layoffs in August at the company, and in October, some further dismissals at Amazon. Thus, it is difficult to imagine that this new game will not be affected by these decisions made by Crystal Dynamics. But it is also possible that its production goes well, and that it could be unveiled before the end of 2025. As a reminder, all we know is that it will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used. Some rumors mention an open world, which could offer many possibilities to the players.

Title: "Our Democracy" (I'm Sure)

By now, whenever you hear anyone invoke the phrase “saving our democracy,” that should be a signal that they are intent on destroying this republic, and with that, your natural rights to free speech, economic liberty, and public order. What began in 2016 as a simple, high-level plot to take out Donald Trump and squash Trumpism — a grassroots revolt against those very high-level DC insiders —turned sharply in 2017 into a long-running cover-up operation that spawned a multiplying cycle of seditions, treasons, and betrayals of the public — as the insiders desperately tried to evade culpability for each previous act — and finally blossomed into a rolling coup with crypto-Jacobin overtones as the insiders’ useful idiots were recruited to run with the ball of color revolution. For those who can’t quite wrap their minds around this game, a color revolution is the surreptitious overthrow of an elected government by concealed parties. Neocons in the US State Department developed the practice of color revolution on many countries over the years. Mr. Obama added a layer of gnostic Marxists to the personnel mix at State, and these wannabe revolutionaries built a fantastic matrix of NGOs outside State to marshal the useful idiots with jobs and salaries. The NGOs, in turn, were connected to international moneybags, with strange agendas of their own such as the megalomanic climate change crusader Bill Gates and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which funds anarchist district attorneys, the defense of election fraud, mass illegal migration, internet censorship, and money-flows into Antifa, the Left’s street fighters.

Hillary Clinton, for instance, surely wants to stay out of jail for her RussiaGate caper, and retain the ill-gotten lucre of the Clinton Foundation she lives off. At 95, George Soros himself is probably beyond caring about all this, but his son Alex, 38, carries on, and recently cemented his alliance with the Clinton Foundation by marrying the former Mrs. Anthony Wiener, Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s long-time wing-gal. The Democratic Party plays an increasingly curious part in this rolling coup as all its efforts look evermore insane and self-extinguishing — the bootless government shutdown being the latest exercise. The party can no longer meaningfully represent organized labor — since labor moved to faraway lands — so it attempted to replace that earnest bond with fronting for women and minorities. This has resulted in two problems. 1) women taking over the actual machinery of the party has transformed mere politics into never-ending psychodrama and boosted the amplitude of political dirty-fighting to dangerous new levels; and 2) cultivating minority groups has led to an orgy of race-and-gender hustles that amount to gigantic racketeering operations (i.e., making money dishonestly). All of that sound, fury, and roguery is now dedicated only to staving off the party’s collapse and thwarting Mr. Trump’s attempt to restore something like regular order in public affairs, which the Democratic Party calls “authoritarianism.” Regular order is something that healthy male psychology takes an interest in, since it entails defense of the culture, in this case, Western Civ and its heritage. That implies the uses of strength as opposed to the stratagems of weakness. It must acknowledge and rely on classic virtues such as fortitude, prudence, and a preference for what is — as opposed to wishes and fantasies. Psychodrama dispenses with all that for the sake of emotional gratification, often mis-characterized as empathy or caring. It can transform easily into sadism — as you can see now with the calls for violence and murder against Trump-adjacent persons. Meanwhile, be aware that the cries for “saving our democracy” come from the people opposed to regular order in elections, that is, voter ID, voting on election day only, with results reported out at day’s end, paper ballots and no electronic counting machines, and no mail-in ballots (except for people out of the country on election day). All of these stipulations are observed in other nations of Western Civ, and beyond, even in lands where people go about half-clothed. The current psychodrama, of course, is the latest installment of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The Democrats are flogging it with Wile E. Coyote zeal. I suspect it is an Acme booby trap for the ages and it is being carefully laid by Mr. Trump, the Roadrunner, to blow up un the Dems’ faces when all the documents are finally sorted out. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the real-world problems that the US faces, such as runaway financialization of the economy, a broken medical system, mass job layoffs, the collapse of education, surging mental illness, the drug plague, and the sinking middle-class. We’re entering a new phase in the ongoing color revolution, the coup against America, and it’s liable to be the final phase in which all the mystery gets wrung out, the motives are revealed, and the players are correctly sorted and labeled according to their deeds. No new psychodrama will avail to stop what’s coming. I’ll be doing two book events Saturday, Nov 15 in New York’s Capital District to talk up my new novel, Look, I’m Gone.

A "difficult but necessary decision". Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet more layoffs at the studio, calling it a "difficult but necessary decision". In a post on LinkedIn, the studio said it has "parted ways" with just under 30 employees. These employees came from a variety of projects and departments within the company, with Crystal Dynamics calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". The developer additionally cited the next entry in the Tomb Raider series, which the studio is working on with Amazon, as part of the reason for its decision. "To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimise the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," it wrote. The post thanked those impacted by the layoffs for "their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways", adding: "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition." Closing, Crystal Dynamics said it appreciated support during these changes at the studio, and that it "[looks] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". This most recent wave of layoffs at the studio is at least the fourth in the last two years. In March, Crystal Dynamics laid off 17 "talented" staff members, again calling it a "difficult decision". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Decision made to "optimise the continued development" of Tomb Raider and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve" Crystal Dynamics has announced a third round of layoffs this year, affecting 30 employees "across various departments and projects." In a post shared on LinkedIn, the developer said it needed to "optimise the continued development of [its] flagship Tomb Raider game" and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve." Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider game was announced in 2022, when it signed a partnership with Amazon Games to publish the title. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways," the studio wrote. "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support during this transition." It added: "We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future." In August, Crystal Dynamics announced an unspecified amount of workers were made redundant. It cited "evolving business conditions" for the decision, which was made to ensure the "long-term health of [its] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." This came after the first round of layoffs this year in March, which affected 17 employees. At the time, the developer said the reason was to "better align [its] current business and the studio's future success." Crystal Dynamics was also the co-developer of the Perfect Dark reboot with The Initiative. The latter was closed and the game was cancelled as part of larger layoffs at Microsoft. These redundancies affected several divisions at Microsoft Gaming, including King, ZeniMax, Raven Software, Turn 10, and Blizzard. Rare's Everwild was also cancelled. In September 2023, 10 people were laid off at Crystal Dynamics following restructuring at its parent company Embracer.

Title: Most Indian IT employees get no advance notice before layoffs, finds Blind survey

The findings, based on responses from 1,396 professionals, highlight widespread abuse of legal loopholes by global tech firms operating in the country. For most affected employees, the layoff process lacked both legal compliance and humane communication. 72 per cent were informed within two days of their last working day. The rate was especially high at Amazon, Target and Freshworks, exceeding 90 per cent. Only 18 per cent said they received any advance notice of one to three months as mandated by law. According to Blind, many MNCs operating in India’s tech and service sectors have long taken advantage of a gap in the country’s labor framework that excludes IT and managerial staff from the “workmen” category. This allows them to legally bypass mandatory notice periods and government approval under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), leaving tens of millions of white-collar professionals outside the scope of labor protections. 37 per cent were informed via Zoom or Teams calls, 23 per cent received impersonal email notifications, and 13 per cent discovered they had been terminated only after their system access was suddenly cut off. Even when sudden layoffs technically breach the spirit of the law, companies frequently use “in lieu of notice” payments to avoid penalties — paying a short-term severance instead of giving advance warning. This loophole enables overnight, American-style layoffs that would otherwise be illegal under Indian labor standards. On Blind, several affected professionals shared how these practices are eroding trust and mental security within India’s tech scene. “It’s a cruel psychological game: keep people anxious, hoping some will quit voluntarily, saving the company money on severance,” wrote an employee from Amazon India. Another user from Samsung pointed to shared resilience, saying, “All I can think of is to become proficient to do something on our own. It could be small, but that ability gives some sense of security.” Published on November 14, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

E-commerce giant Amazon cut 660 jobs in Manhattan in October, according to a report by the New York Post citing New York State government records. Amazon confirmed that nine office locations were affected, impacting only corporate employees. The most affected sites were two locations. The 450 W 33rd St offices near Hudson Yards experienced 233 layoffs, and the 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship, acquired by Amazon in 2020 for $1 billion, had 182 layoffs, the report said, citing Monday filings from the state Department of Labour. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon, and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and the AI revolution in motion.” The latest development after Amazon confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy highlighted growing use of AI. During Amazon's earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not due to cost-cutting measures or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said that the employees affected did not align with Amazon's culture. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” The layoffs are impacting various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post last month. Galetti hinted at further job cuts, mentioning Amazon's plan to hire in key areas in 2026. The company reportedly plans to cut approximately 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of layoffs, which will constitute about 9% of its global office-based workforce, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the development. Indicating the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Who’s Afraid of the AI Boogeyman?
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/whos-afraid-of-the-ai-boogeyman/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T23:00:00Z

It is becoming ever more obvious that many people fear rapidly developing Artificial Intelligence (AI), for various reasons, such as its supposed superiority, compared to humans, as far as processing and manipulating information is concerned, as well as its adaptability and efficiency in the workplace, which many fear would lead to the replacement of most human beings in the employment market. Amazon recently announced that it was replacing 14,000 individuals with AI robots, for example. Alex Valdes writes: The layoffs are reportedly the largest in Amazon history, and come just months after CEO Andy Jassy outlined his vision for how the company would rapidly ramp up its development of generative AI and AI agents. The cuts are the latest in a wave of layoffs this year as tech giants including Microsoft, Accenture, Salesforce and India’s TCS have reduced their workforces by thousands in what has become a frenzied push to invest in AI. Lest this is too disturbing to tolerate, contrast this with the reassuring statement, from an AI developer, to boot, that AI agents could not replace human beings. Brian Shilhavy points out that: Andrej Karpathy, one of the founding members of OpenAI, on Friday threw cold water on the idea that artificial general intelligence is around the corner. He also cast doubt on various assumptions about AI made by the industry’s biggest boosters, such as Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman. The highly regarded Karpathy called reinforcement learning—arguably the most important area of research right now—’terrible,’ said AI-powered coding agents aren’t as exciting as many people think, and said AI cannot reason about anything it hasn’t already been trained on. His comments, from a podcast interview with Dwarkesh Patel, struck a chord with some of the AI researchers we talk to, including those who have also worked at OpenAI and Anthropic. They also echoed comments we heard from researchers at the International Conference on Machine Learning earlier this year. A lot of Karpathy’s criticisms of his own field seem to boil down to a single point: As much as we like to anthropomorphize large language models, they’re not comparable to humans or even animals in the way they learn. For instance, zebras are up and walking around just a few minutes after they’re born, suggesting that they’re born with some level of innate intelligence, while LLMs have to go through immense trial and error to learn any new skill, Karpathy points out. This is already comforting, but lest the fear of AI persist, it can be dispelled further by elaborating on the differences between AI and human beings, which, if understood adequately, would drive home the realisation that such anxieties are mostly redundant (although others are not, as I shall argue below). The most obvious difference in question is the fact that AI (for example, ChatGPT) is dependent on being equipped with a vast database on which it draws to come up with answers to questions, which it formulates predictively through pattern recognition. Then, as pointed out above, even the most sophisticated AI has to be ‘trained’ to yield the information one seeks. Moreover, unlike humans, it lacks ‘direct’ access to experiential reality in perceptual, spatiotemporal terms – something which I have experienced frequently when confronted by people who draw on ChatGPT to question certain arguments. For example, when I gave a talk recently on how Freud and Hannah Arendt’s work – on civilisation and totalitarianism, respectively – enables one to grasp the character of the globalist onslaught against extant society, with a view to establishing a central, AI-controlled world government, someone in the audience produced a printout of ChatGPT’s response to the question, whether these two thinkers could indeed deliver the goods, as it were. Predictably, it summarised the relevant work of these two thinkers quite adequately, but was stumped by the requirement to show how it applies to the growing threat of totalitarian control in real time. My interlocutor used this as grounds to question my own assertions in this regard, on the assumption that the AI bot’s response was an indication that no such threat exists. Needless to stress, it was not difficult to repudiate this claim by reminding him of ChatGPT’s dependence on being supplied with the relevant data, while we humans have access to the latter on experiential grounds, which I proceeded to outline to him. The fear of AI also finds expression in science fiction, together with intimations of possible modes of resistance to AI-machines which may – probably would – attempt to exterminate their human creators, as has been imagined in science fiction cinema, including Moore’s Battlestar Galactica and Cameron’s Terminator films. It is not difficult to demonstrate that such products of popular culture frame the current symptoms of fear pertaining to AI in imaginary terms, which may be seen as a crystallisation of repressed, unconscious anxiety, related to what Freud called ‘the uncanny’ (unheimlich, in German; more on this below). Both Moore and Cameron elaborate on the likelihood that the very creatures engendered by human beings’ technological ingenuity will eventually turn on their creators to annihilate them. In Alex Garland’s Ex Machina (2014), again, one witnesses an AI ‘fembot’ called Ava, subtly manipulating her human counterparts to the point of her escape from confinement and their own destruction. Undeniably, these, and many other similar instances, are incontrovertible evidence of a hidden fear on the part of humanity that AI constitutes a possible threat to its own existence. Precisely because these fears are lodged in the human unconscious, however, they are not the main reason to take any threat posed by AI seriously, although they do comprise a valuable caveat. The chief reason for regarding AI as a legitimate source of intimidation does not arise from AI as such, as many readers probably already know. Rather, it concerns the manner in which the globalists intend to use AI to control what they perceive as the ‘useless eaters’ – the rest of us, in other words. And those of us who do not go along with their grandiose plans of total world control would fall victim to being ‘reprogrammed’ into compliant ‘sheeple’ by AI: Yuval Noah Harari has emerged from the shadows to brag about the new technology developed by WEF scientists which he warns has the power to destroy every human in the world by transforming them into transhuman entities. Harari has made clear who will survive the great depopulation event the elite have been warning us about for years. According to Harari, the global elite will survive thanks to a ‘technological Noah’s ark’ while the rest of us will be left to perish. In this vastly depopulated world, the elite will be free to change themselves into transhuman entities and become the gods they already believe themselves to be. But first the elite need to eliminate the non-compliant masses, those who are opposed to the anti-life and godless WEF agenda, and as Harari boasts, the elite now command the AI technology to ‘ethically’ destroy non-compliant humans by hijacking their brains. Disturbingly, Harari’s claims are grounded in reality and the WEF is rolling out the mind-control technology as we speak. Davos claims the tech can transform criminals, including those accused of thought crimes, into perfectly compliant globalist citizens who will never dissent again. There you have it – AI will be the tool, if the globalists have their way, of forcing us into submission. Needless to point out, this could only happen if sufficient numbers of people fail to resist their plans, and judging by the number of people who are showing their opposition to the would-be rulers of the world, this will not occur. Another way of gaining an understanding of the fear of AI is to liken it to what is commonly known as ‘the boogeyman.’ As some people may know, the ‘boogeyman’ (or ‘bogeyman’) – a creature of mythical proportions, which assumes different shapes and sizes in many cultures, often to scare children as a way of eliciting good behaviour – is variously presented as a monstrous, grotesque, or shapeless creature. As a little research indicates, the word derives from the Middle English term, ‘bogge,’ or ‘bugge,’ which means ‘scarecrow,’ or ‘frightening spectre.’ Being a quintessentially human phenomenon, it is not surprising that it has equivalent names in many folklore traditions and languages across the world. Just like languages, depictions of this frightening figure diverge strikingly, often attaining its ominous and scary character from the element of formlessness, such as the figure of ‘El Coco’ in Spanish-speaking countries, the ‘Sack Man’ in Latin America, and the ‘Babau’ in Italy, sometimes imagined as a tall, black-coated man. The boogeyman figure may be regarded as a kind of Jungian archetype, encountered in the collective unconscious, which probably originated centuries ago from parents’ need to frighten children into obedience by means of a version of the unknown. In South Africa, where I live, it sometimes assumes the shape of what indigenous people call the ‘tikoloshe’ – a malevolent, and sometimes mischievous, dwarfish figure with an enormous sexual appetite. Being an archetype, it has also made its way into a popular genre such as horror film, manifesting itself in grotesque characters such as Freddy Krueger, the eponymous ‘Nightmare on Elm Street.’ So, in what sense does AI resemble the ‘boogeyman?’ The latter is related to what Sigmund Freud memorably called ‘the uncanny,’ of which he writes (in The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, translated by James Strachey, 1974: 3676): ‘…the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar.’ This already hints at what he uncovers later in this essay, after uncovering the surprising fact that the German word for ‘homely,’ to wit, ‘heimlich,’ turns out to be ambivalent in its usage, so that it sometimes means the opposite of ‘homely,’ namely ‘unheimlich’ (‘unhomely,’ better translated as ‘uncanny’). That the concept of ‘the uncanny’ is suitable to grasp what I have in mind when I allude to ‘the fear of AI,’ becomes evident where Freud writes (referring to another author whose work on the ‘uncanny’ he regarded as important; Freud 1974: 3680): When we proceed to review the things, persons, impressions, events and situations which are able to arouse in us a feeling of the uncanny in a particularly forcible and definite form, the first requirement is obviously to select a suitable example to start on. Jentsch has taken as a very good instance ‘doubts whether an apparently animate being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might not be in fact animate;’ and he refers in this connection to the impression made by wax-work figures, ingeniously constructed dolls and automata. To these he adds the uncanny effect of epileptic fits, and of manifestations of insanity, because these excite in the spectator the impression of automatic, mechanical processes at work behind the ordinary appearance of mental activity. Here, already one encounters a trait of the uncanny that conspicuously applies to AI – the impression created by AI that it is somehow ‘alive.’ This was the case even of the first, ‘primitive’ computers, such as the one in the episode on the First Commandment, of Krzysztof Kieslowski’s 1989 television series regarding the Ten Commandments, called The Decalogue, where the words, ‘I am here,’ appear on the computer screen when the father and his son use it. The ominous implication in this episode is that if humanity were to replace God with AI, it would be disastrous for us, as shown in the fact that the father is sufficiently ‘rationalist’ to trust the computer’s calculations of the thickness of the ice on which his son skates, which turns out to be wrong, leading to the child’s death. Freud continues his investigation of the nature of ‘the uncanny’ by paying sustained attention to the work of E.T.A. Hoffman, whose stories are famous for producing a strong sense of the uncanny, particularly the tale of ‘The Sand-Man’ – ‘who tears out children’s eyes’ – which features, among several other uncanny figures (and very significantly), a beautiful, lifelike doll called Olympia. He then explains it by relating it in psychoanalytical terms to the castration complex – attached to the father figure – via the fear of losing one’s eyes (Freud 1974: 3683-3685). Freud continues his interpretation of the uncanny in a revealing manner by invoking a number of other psychoanalytically relevant aspects of experience, of which the following one appears to apply to AI (1974: 3694): …an uncanny effect is often and easily produced when the distinction between imagination and reality is effaced, as when something that we have hitherto regarded as imaginary appears before us in reality, or when a symbol takes over the full functions of the thing it symbolizes, and so on. It is this factor which contributes not a little to the uncanny effect attaching to magical practices. It is not difficult to recall instances in one’s childhood, Freud avers, when one has imagined inanimate objects, like toys (or animate ones, for that matter, such as a pet dog) to be capable of talking to you, but when it actually appears to happen (which would be a hallucination, as opposed to a deliberate imagining), it unavoidably produces an uncanny effect. One might expect the same thing to be the case with AI, whether in the shape of a computer or a robot, and ordinarily – perhaps at an earlier stage of AI development – this would probably have been the case. But today seems to be different: people, especially the young, have become so accustomed to interacting with computer software programmes, and recently with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, that what might have been an experience of the uncanny before is, for all intents and purposes, no longer the case. In this respect, the ‘uncanny’ appears to have been domesticated. As long ago as 2011, in Alone Together, Sherry Turkle reported that she was concerned about young people displaying an increasing tendency to prefer interacting with machines, rather than other human beings. Hence, it should not be in the least surprising that AI chatbots have assumed the guise of something ‘normal’ in the sphere of communication (leaving aside for the moment the question of the status of this vaunted ‘communication’). Furthermore – and here the fear of what AI could bring about on the part of all-too-trusting individuals raises its ugly head – from recent reports (such as this one) it is apparent that, particularly the young, are extremely susceptible to chatbots’ ‘advice’ and suggestions concerning their own actions, as Michael Snyder points out: Our kids are being targeted by AI chatbots on a massive scale, and most parents have no idea that this is happening. When you are young and impressionable, having someone tell you exactly what you want to hear can be highly appealing. AI chatbots have become extremely sophisticated, and millions of America’s teens are developing very deep relationships with them. Is this just harmless fun, or is it extremely dangerous? A brand new study that was just released by the Center for Democracy & Technology contains some statistics that absolutely shocked me… A new study published Oct. 8 by the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) found that 1 in 5 high school students have had a relationship with an AI chatbot, or know someone who has. In a 2025 report from Common Sense Media, 72% of teens had used an AI companion, and a third of teen users said they had chosen to discuss important or serious matters with AI companions instead of real people. We aren’t just talking about a few isolated cases anymore. At this stage, literally millions upon millions of America’s teens are having very significant relationships with AI chatbots. Unfortunately, there are many examples where these relationships are leading to tragic consequences. After 14-year-old Sewell Setzer developed a ‘romantic relationship’ with a chatbot on Character.AI, he decided to take his own life… As the preceding discussion shows, there are some areas of human activity where one need not fear AI, and then there are others where such fears are legitimate, sometimes because of the manner in which unscrupulous people harness AI against other people. But whatever the case may be, the best way to approach the tricky terrain regarding the capabilities of AI vis-á-vis humans is to remind oneself of the fact that – as argued at the outset in this article – AI depends on vast amounts of data to draw on, and on being ‘trained’ by programmers to do this. Humans do not.

Δ According to the Thursday (Nov. 13) report, this would be the largest workforce reduction in the telecommunications giant’s history. In addition, 200 Verizon retail stores will be transitioned into franchised operations, sources said. This restructuring would remove the employees working at those locations from Verizon’s payroll. According to securities findings, as of February, Verizon had approximately 100,000 employees. As PYMNTS reported, the company appointed Dan Schulman as its CEO last month. Schulman, who previously held CEO roles at PayPal and Virgin Mobile USA, took over at Verizon as competition in the wireless and home internet markets continues to intensify. The largest U.S. telecommunications provider by subscriber base, Verizon is trying to offset the loss of postpaid phone subscribers for three consecutive quarters and a net loss of 7,000 postpaid phone connections in the latest quarter, WSJ said. Despite customer retention efforts, such as offering price-lock guarantees, competitors like AT&T and T-Mobile have continued to gain ground, the report said. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Pledging to cut costs and exit unprofitable legacy businesses aggressively, Schulman reportedly said in a call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, “We have a tremendous amount of opportunity to be more efficient, to be scrappier. Cost reductions will be a way of life for us here.” Verizon is not the only major company that’s downsizing to adapt to economic and technological shifts. As PYMNTS recently reported, Amazon has started cutting 30,000 jobs, UPS is rolling out buyouts and layoffs affecting 34,000 drivers and warehouse workers, and Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs. The WSJ report quoted analysts from Morgan Stanley as saying that improvements for Verizon’s operational and financial performance are “possible, if not probable,” if the company maintains a rational market approach.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Says ‘Painful’ Layoffs Required To ‘Optimize’ Development For Next Tomb Raider

Amazon GamesCrystal DynamicsLayoffsTomb Raider Crystal Dynamics is undergoing another round of cuts. It revealed on Thursday that nearly 30 more developers would be laid off as the company restructures for the future. Specifically, it claimed the cuts were necessary to “optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game.” The Amazon Games-backed project was announced three years ago and still no official details have been shared, though Kotaku understands its development has been challenging as Crystal Dynamics tried to push the franchise in the direction of an open-world experience. The studio announced the layoffs on LinkedIn: Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams. As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition. To our players – as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future. We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team’s amazing new work with the world in the future. It’s the third round of layoffs this year and comes only months after cuts that were made due to the Microsoft’s cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was doing the bulk of development on. The Xbox stealth action game was reportedly almost revived under a new publisher, but the deal felt apart over IP rights. The studio has been part of Embracer Group since it was sold by Square Enix as part of a $300 million package back in 2022. Its publishing partner for Tomb Raider, Amazon Games, recently underwent its own mass layoffs and announced it was taking a step back from certain internally developed AAA games.

Title: Corporate Executives Say Trump’s Economy Has Left U.S. Consumers “Under Pressure” and “Stressed”

A project of Common Dreams press@groundworkcollaborative.org Corporate executives are quietly acknowledging what millions of Americans already feel: Trump’s economy is squeezing lower- and middle-income families while corporations enjoy record profits and the wealthy continue to prosper. Consumer outlook indicators point in the same direction. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment declined across nearly every demographic group this November — by age, income, and political leaning — except for those with the largest stock portfolios, whose confidence jumped 11%. Similarly, consumer confidence data from the Conference Board showed that the confidence dropped among Americans earning under $75,000 and increased the most for those making more than $200,000 — a clear sign that everyday Americans are growing more worried about their finances, having to spend less just to stay afloat as the K-shaped economy deepens. Key Excerpts Food and Beverage Industry Scott Boatwright, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer and Director said during a Q3 2025 earnings call: “Earlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency across all income cohorts. Since then, the gap has widened, with low to middle-income guests further reducing frequency.” He continued to say, “The economists we have spoken to over the last several quarters, say, Q4, Q1 [are] likely to be the toughest for the consumer. Specifically the cohort under $100,000. A particularly challenged cohort is the 25- to 35-year-old age group [...] This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth.” Coca-Cola's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun stated during a Q3 2025 earnings call that “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups. The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there." Constellation Brands (Makers of Modello and Corona Beer) Chief Executive Officer William Newlands told attendees at the Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025 “The Hispanic consumer is very concerned at the moment. 80% are concerned about socioeconomic factors, 75% are concerned about their personal finances. It means that their shopping behavior has changed.” General Mills’ Group President of North America Retail & North America Pet Dana McNabb said during an Investor Day meeting that “the consumer is still adjusting to this once-in-a-lifetime inflationary period and trying to find their footing...they're stressed." General Mills’ CEO Jeffery Harmening followed up by noting that "the combination of the length of the inflation that we have seen and inflation is still running at or ahead of wage growth. And so consumers, if you're making $200,000 a year or less, you are really feeling that pinch even still today." Kraft-Heinz CEO and Director Carlos Abrams-Rivera laid it out on the Q3 2025 earning call saying that “fact that we have now one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades...it is a unique moment right now in which this is getting -- the consumer negativity and the sentiment is extending longer than we had originally expected." Jack Sinclair, CEO and director for grocery store chain Sprout's Farmers Market told shareholders on the Q3 2025 earnings Call that "from a consumer pressure perspective, I mean, I think that's building … a little bit more in the kind of lower and middle income is what you read about and what you hear. [...] middle-income trade areas, younger demographics … it's just a little more pronounced in those, but I think the pressure is there for everybody and everyone is trying to figure out how they manage through that in a dynamic environment.” Dirk Van de Put, the Chair and CEO of Mondelez (Makers of Oreo cookies, Halls cough drops, and Wheat Thins) said on a Q3 2025 earnings call that while their consumers are “very concerned in general about the economy, frustrated with the pricing they're seeing,” Mondelez’s seasonal products allow the company to charge higher prices because "the consumer is not that clear on what the right price point is and also is inclined to pay a little bit more." Travel Industry American Airlines' Chief Strategy Officer, Steve Johnson, said on a Q3 earnings call that “Nearly 50% of our ticket revenue comes from premium,” and as a result the airline is planning to add additional premium seats to its fleet. On an Q3 earnings call, Scott Kirby, United Airlines’ CEO described how economic stress causes demand to "bleed off on the lower end” making more seats available for brand loyal customers.

"He’s pretending he was always good with this vote—as he and his lackeys keep scheming to prevent it from going any further," said a former Republican congressman. President Donald Trump has spent months doing everything in his power to downplay and dismiss calls to release the government’s files about his former friend, the powerful sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. But as he faces a mutiny within his own party and a steady drip of new scandalous details about his relationship with the disgraced financier, Trump abruptly changed course on Sunday, calling for House Republicans to hold a vote on releasing the files. " House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "And it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party." "I wouldn’t even call it the Justice Department anymore. It’s become Trump’s personal law firm." Dozens of former US Department of Justice attorneys have now gone on record to describe the unprecedented corruption of federal law enforcement taking place during President Donald Trump's second term. In a lengthy story published on Sunday by the New York Times, the former DOJ attorneys described rampant politicization of prosecutions, directives to dig up evidence on Trump's political foes, and orders to drop investigations into potential terrorist plots and white-collar crimes. "The law is clear," said one advocacy group, "what's been missing is the political will to use it." The US Department of Justice shuttered an antitrust probe into the heavily consolidated meatpacking industry shortly before President Donald Trump announced that he had asked the department to investigate whether companies are unlawfully colluding to push up beef prices. Bloomberg reported late last week that Trump administration officials "formally notified companies recently that they were closing a probe into sharp price increases" during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The probe began during Trump's first term and continued through the Biden administration, which used executive action to target price gouging in the meatpacking industry.

Title: As Trump Drives Up Costs, Record Share of Subprime Auto Loans Overdue

"The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," said one finance professor. Last month's jobs report may never be released after being delayed during the federal government shutdown, but other figures demonstrate the havoc President Donald Trump is wreaking on the US economy, including new data for subprime borrowers behind on car payments. The share of US borrowers with low credit scores or limited credit histories who are at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest percentage since Fitch Ratings began tracking it in the early 1990s. "The vulnerable part of the economy is having an even tougher time making ends meet," Massachusetts Institute of Technology finance professor Christopher Palmer told Marketplace on Wednesday in response to the new data. As Bloomberg reported Wednesday: Fitch's findings on missed car payments notably follow two key disruptions in the auto lending space. "PrimaLend, which serves the 'buy-here-pay-here' auto financing market—where dealers sell and directly finance vehicles for customers with poor or limited credit—filed for bankruptcy protection last month," Reuters reported. "Tricolor, which sold cars and provided auto loans mostly to low-income Hispanic communities in the Southwestern United States, also filed for bankruptcy in September." In mid-October, the credit score model development company VantageScore released an analysis showing that auto loans "have now evolved from being one of the least risky consumer credit products to one of the loan types most prone to delinquencies," as consumers struggle with rising interest rates, financing costs, and prices of cars, insurance, and repairs. "Auto loans have not followed the trends of other credit products as delinquencies have been persistently trending up across all credit tiers and income groups over the past 15 years," said VantageScore's chief economist and strategy officer, Rikard Bandebo, in a statement. "Even after the industry tightened lending criteria three years ago, delinquencies have continued to rise." A few days before the VantageScore analysis, Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book announced that in September, the average transaction price (ATP) of a new vehicle in the US had soared above $50,000 for the first time. "It is important to remember that the new vehicle market is inflationary. Prices go up over time, and today's market is certainly reminding us of that," said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating last month. "The $20,000 vehicle is now mostly extinct, and many price-conscious buyers are sidelined or cruising in the used vehicle market. Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates, and are propping up the higher end of the market." "Tariffs have introduced new cost pressure to the business, but the pricing story in September was mostly driven by the healthy mix of EVs and higher-end vehicles pushing the new vehicle ATP into uncharted territory," she added. "We've been expecting to break through the $50,000 barrier. It was only a matter of time, especially when you consider the bestselling vehicle in America is a pickup truck from Ford that routinely costs north of $65,000. That's today's market, and it is ripe for disruption." Other recent findings that have shown the economic deterioration under Trump include a Thursday report from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which found that the average US family is spending around $700 more each month on basic items since Trump returned to office in January. "As families across the country spend more to pay their bills and put food on the table, Democrats and Republicans should be working together to lower costs," said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), the JEC’s ranking member. "Instead, President Trump is pushing ahead with reckless tariffs that continue to fuel inflation and drive prices up even higher." A closely watched University of Michigan survey revealed last week that since October, consumer sentiment has fallen over 6% to 50.3, the second-lowest level since 1978, and the "current economic conditions" index has dropped nearly 11% to an all-time low of 52.3. Earlier in November, the Washington Post reported on layoff data from corporate outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which documented 153,000 job cuts in October, bringing the total for this year to 1.1 million. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009," said the firm's CEO, John Challenger.

Title: Verizon layoffs: American telecommunications company to cut 15,000 jobs amid restructuring — Who will get affected?

Verizon layoffs: Verizon, the leading American telecommunications company, is set to reduce thousands of roles as part of a restructuring under its new CEO Dan Schulman, reported Reuters. The company is planning to cut about 15,000 jobs, 15% of its workforce, said the report, citing person familiar with the matter. However, a Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The new CEO's first commitment was to stop the bleeding from subscriber churn, which would require subsidizing expensive handsets for a huge number of Verizon's subscribers to keep them from leaving, Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, told Reuters. The layoffs are set to take place as soon as next week. The job cuts are aimed at Verizon's non-union management ranks and are expected to affect more than 20% of that workforce, a source told Reuters. He added that Verizon also plans to transition around 180 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations. As subscriber growth slows and cautious consumers are unwilling to buy premium wireless plans, Verizon is battling rising competition. The coompany is also facing mounting pressure from rivals AT&T and T-Mobile US. At the end of 2024, Verizon had about 1,00,000 US employees. Last year it announced a reduction of 4,800 employees through a voluntary program and took a nearly $2 billion charge. — Verizon spent $52 billion to acquire key wireless C-Band spectrum in a 2021 auction. — The telecommunication company struck a $20 billion deal to acquire Frontier Communications last year. — Verizon also spent $6 billion to acquire prepaid mobile phone provider TracFone Wireless. Amazon, TCS, Microsoft, IBM and several other companies have announced layoffs. Earlier this month, tech giant IBM said that it would cut thousands of roles amid focus on software growth. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” said the company's spokesperson. According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs — over 110,502 tech workers have been laid off across 226 tech companies in 2025 alone. Amazon has announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people. The total workforce of Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest IT services firm, reduced to 593,314 after the count dropped by 19,755, as of the second quarter of the financial year 2025-26.

Title: This is how MAGA falls
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4352278/posts
Time Published: 2025-11-13T13:30:32Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye As in his first term, Donald Trump now presides over a visibly sinking ship as his approval ratings slide. MAGA, a movement built around the personality of one man, never amounted to a coherent political force or even a workable coalition. Claims that Trump and his lieutenants won a mandate in 2024 and then ‘saved’ the country were always delusional. After all, his margin was thin, as was that of his party in Congress. Three forces are killing MAGA, perhaps even pushing the US in a distinctly socialist direction. The first are the internal divisions, which are growing ever-more pronounced and will only intensify as an aging Trump becomes an ever-lamer duck, particularly if Democrats romp to victory again in the 2026 midterms. The second, arguably more serious, weakness lies in the loss of the Latino vote – a growing political force in many states. Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President. Unfortunately, there's a good chance a Democrat President will be taking credit for those jobs. 1 posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye There isn’t going to be any 2026 Mid-term!

Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media.

There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media.

In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats.

Title: Don't Chase Google, Meta: IBM Chief Scientist Urges Graduates To Examine Sectors Outside Silicon Valley

IBM Chief Scientist Ruchir Puri urged tech graduates to explore avenues beyond chasing after the prestige of Silicon Valley tech giants such as Google, Meta or Microsoft. He encouraged them to instead look into those sectors and industries where they find potential for innovation, in light of the turbulence in the job market primarily stemming from AI. "Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after," Puri said, indicating that software engineers have niches they can thrive in beyond large tech companies. "Artificial intelligence is transforming every sector — from agriculture to retail — and meaningful work is happening everywhere," he said in an interview with Business Today. Puri used the example of agricultural manufacturing company John Deere which have used AI and automation to optimise its operations in innovative ways. The firm has pioneered ecofriendly and economical ways to engage in weeding, such as the 'spot and spray' method, where cameras and AI are used to find and target individual weeds, helping farmer cut costs and reduce damage to crops. “Graduates often overlook such enterprises while focusing narrowly on Silicon Valley,” Puri said. He asked freshers to see beyond "a narrow set of tech companies" and to look to the "massive enterprise landscape". His comments can also be contextualised with the increasing number of lay-offs and lower job demand in tech companies with the advent of AI automation. Job postings reduced 16% year-over-year, according to an August report from Handshake, at the same time, applications per posting went up 26% showing the gap between demand and supply. Tech conglomerates such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Amazon have announced waves of layoffs in 2025. IBM also stated earlier in the month that it would get rid of thousands of positions across the globe in the fourth quarter. However the firm also said that its planning to ramp up hiring young graduates for AI-centred positions, according statements chief executive officer Arvidn Krishna made to CNN in an interview. “People are talking about layoffs or hiring freezes, but I actually want to say we are the opposite,” Krishna said. “We expect to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in recent years," he added.

Title: As industry layoffs become the ‘new normal’, so does fear of AI’s impact on adland’s job market

Full Content:
Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Job cuts made at Brandtech group media agency Jellyfish may be the latest symptom of a contracting advertising and marketing job market. The company cut as many as 50 roles at the end of October, following a slowdown in client spending, Digiday has learned. “Our existing clients were spending less money, some of those were retracting the projects that they had planned, and that obviously led to a revenue hit,” said one exec whose role was cut in the layoffs and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jellyfish confirmed the cuts. “Like everyone in marketing, our business is dynamic and we are constantly making shifts in our resources, redesigning roles and structures,” said a spokesperson. “At 8% we have one of the lowest churn rates in the industry. Currently there is a very small number of roles affected in the U.S. and U.K.” Those let go face difficult circumstances. One ad-tech executive made redundant earlier this year, who exchanged candor for anonymity, told Digiday that 11 months on, they were still without a permanent position. Compared with previous job markets, they said new positions were thinner on the ground. “Back then I could walk out of a job and walk into five interviews the following day. Now, I can’t get the interview,” they said. “It’s a tough market.” Jellyfish’s cuts are small, compared with the job losses at holding company agencies in recent months. Forrester analysis suggests agency headcounts have fallen 8% in 2025. In August, Dentsu committed to eliminating 3,400 jobs worldwide, approximately 8% of its staff. WPP, meanwhile, cut 7,000 during the final months of Mark Read’s CEO tenure; 700 came from Ogilvy alone. Interpublic Group has laid off 3,200 employees this year, while its to-be acquirer Omnicom already cut its global headcount by 3,000 jobs in 2024 and has been working to reduce staff costs by 10% in the run-up to that merger’s completion. Once the deal is complete, it expects to find $750 million in cost savings — given labor costs always lead the balance sheet, that’s not great news for the thousands working under each umbrella. “Layoffs have become the new normal,” said the former Jellyfish exec. But industry job losses aren’t limited to agencies. In October, TikTok cut 400 jobs in the U.K. from its Trust and Safety Team, while Target cut 1,800 white-collar positions, and Amazon recently announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 roles. CPG giant Nestlé plans to cut 12,000 office staff. Between August and December 2024 (the most recent data), the American ad industry lost 4,600 roles overall according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And data from Britain’s Office for National Statistics showed job openings in the advertising and marketing industries had fallen 7.5% between 2022 and 2025. That’s set against rising unemployment in the U.S. (4.3% in August) and the U.K. (5% in September); U.S. firms, particularly retailers, announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some of the firms responsible have laid out their own justifications for reducing headcount. A historic merger here; long-term underperformance there; a restructuring ahead of a potential sale. Add them all together, and a pattern emerges. “What we’re seeing is layoffs as a result of restructuring and financial distress,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, who referenced an estimate by Madison & Wall that suggested the four largest holdcos averaged just 0.3% organic growth in Q3, the lowest for five years. “If you’ve got a category that is in effect growing less than 1% then yes, they’re shedding jobs, because jobs are the number one overhead,” he added. This year’s job cuts can be traced to restructuring and client cutbacks. But generative AI is the ghost at the leaving party. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” said Beth Galetti, svp of people experience and technology at Amazon, in an Oct. 28 blog post sent to Amazon employees. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Naveen Tewari, CEO of ad tech firm InMobi, warned in February that AI progress meant his software engineers “will not have jobs within two years.” Statements like Tewari’s are leaving marketing execs looking for their next role worried they’re going to be frozen out, experience be damned. The anonymous ad tech exec voiced fears that older workers could be disproportionately affected, and that a perception they’re less adept with gen AI tools could be used as cover for ageist discrimination. 40% of advertising staffers aged between 40 and 55 feel their age has limited their career, according to research by the IPA and the Advertising Association. “It does start to feel like ageism and a slight white male-ism,” they said. Pattisall suggested that while this year’s layoffs can be primarily traced to restructuring pushes, next year’s will be provoked by AI. Two years ago, Forrester predicted that AI, automation and efficiency initiatives would result in a net 7.5% reduction in the U.S. advertising workforce. Its most recent report upgraded that estimate to 15% by the end of next year. Again, this isn’t limited to ad agencies. Over a quarter of private-sector employers expect to cut staff as a result of AI, according to a survey of 2,000 firms by the Chartered Institue of Personnel and Development, the U.K. professional body for HR. 62% said they believed that admin and managerial roles were most at risk. “The technology was nascent when we developed that forecast in in mid-2023,” explained Pattisall. “We had not factored for agentic and agents. I think we’ll see a larger percentage of the advertising population that can be replaced by those tools.” — Jessica Davies contributed reporting to this story The platform has shared a plethora of incentives, to motivate sellers to spend more money.

by Michael Snyder | Nov 12, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second-lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: In America’s K-Shaped Economy, The Rich Are Getting Richer While Almost Everyone Else Is Getting The Sharp End Of The Stick

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Pundits have been talking a lot about America’s “K-shaped economy” lately, but most average people on the street have no idea what that means. Basically, it means that the wealthy are getting even wealthier while almost everyone else is getting monkey-hammered. Yesterday, I detailed 11 signs that economic conditions in the U.S. are the worst that they have been since the Great Recession, but if you have plenty of money you may feel like everything is just great right now. For those at the top of the economic pyramid, it could be argued that these are the best of times because the stock market has been soaring. But for many of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, it literally feels like we are in the midst of a horrifying economic crisis. At a time when the cost of living is crushing most of the population, debt levels are exploding, and mass layoffs are happening all over the nation, we continue to see “strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans”… Experts describe the current U.S. economy as “K-shaped,” a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the “K” represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans. By contrast, the letter’s lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs. The top 10 percent of all income earners have always spent more money than everyone else. But now the proportion of consumer spending that they are accounting for has reached the highest level ever recorded… These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi. “That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it’s ever been in the data,” he told CBS News. If you are thriving in this very difficult economic environment, that is a good thing. However, you should also be aware that most people are really struggling, and that is especially true for low-income Americans. In fact, the percentage of subprime borrowers that are “at least 60 days past due on their auto loans” just shot up to the highest level we have ever seen… More Americans than ever are falling behind on their car payments. The share of subprime borrowers at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest in data going back to 1994, according to Fitch Ratings. With ongoing inflation pressures and the return of student loan bills, millions of car owners are struggling to afford their monthly payments. It’s the latest sign of weakness in the US economy as the Federal Reserve considers the path of future rate cuts. We never even got a number this bad during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. As a result, vehicle repossessions are absolutely soaring. This is the economic reality that most of us are living in. According to one recent survey, 55 percent of American workers are concerned that they could soon lose their jobs… Some 55% of employed Americans say they’re concerned about losing their jobs, according to a recent Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That angst follows a drumbeat of layoff announcements by major employers, including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. calculated the most job cut announcements for any October in more than two decades. It comes layered on top of households’ exasperation over the cost of living. A 62% majority in the Oct. 23-25 poll said the cost of their everyday items had climbed over the last month and nearly half of those people said the increases have been difficult to afford. In previous recessions, low paid workers got laid off in very high numbers. This time around, it is highly paid workers that are getting hit particularly hard. Even highly successful tech companies such as Amazon are eliminating good paying jobs… Amazon is laying off almost 700 corporate workers based in New York City as part of the company’s nearly 14,000 corporate layoffs. The layoffs, which were first reported by Crain’s New York, were disclosed in a filing with the New York State Department of Labor. In total, 660 employees are being laid off by Amazon across nine offices in New York City. Among them, the largest layoffs affect Amazon’s Manhattan West office and its New York Tech Hub, also based in Manhattan. It appears that the employment market is really starting to deteriorate. And the most recent weekly report from ADP seems to confirm this… Recent announcements of large layoffs at a few prominent companies have raised concerns that the labor market could be weakening further, and today’s new weekly ADP employment report confirms that fear. The ADP weekly jobless report pointed to a deterioration in US labor momentum, stating that “for the four weeks ending Oct. 25, 2025, private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs a week, suggesting that the labor market struggled to produce jobs consistently during the second half of the month.” Added together that is 45,000 job losses in the month (not including government workers), which would be the largest monthly drop in jobs since March 2023… But if you have lots of cash in the bank and you are not concerned about the security of your job, you might be feeling pretty good right about now. As Peter Atwater has aptly noted, those that are sitting at the top are “spending like there’s no tomorrow”… Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts, said that the biggest division is America is not on the left and right, it’s up and down between those at the top and bottom of the US economy. For those at the top, the economy looks good and they are ‘spending like there’s no tomorrow.’ But Atwater says Americans on the bottom are already facing recession conditions, as people struggle with affordability. Of course the prosperity that high earners are currently experiencing is just temporary. Anyone that thinks that this stock market bubble is sustainable is simply not being rational. Key ratios were not even this out of whack during the most euphoric days of the Dotcom bubble. What goes up must come down. But for now the wealthy are living the high life while most of the rest of us really struggle to make ends meet from month to month.

Title: From Product Manager to Entrepreneur: The Grit, Grind, and Growth Behind the Title

Leaving a steady role at a company like American Express to start your own AI consulting firm sounds glamorous… until you realize just how much grit it takes to turn that vision into revenue. In a recent episode of Productside Stories, I sat down with Cooper Craig, a former product manager who traded enterprise decks for small-business deals and built a thriving AI agency from the ground up. His story (and his scars) reveal what it really takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur in 2025’s AI-charged economy. The timing isn’t accidental. 2025 has seen a wave of experienced product managers exploring entrepreneurship. Some are leaving big tech; others are launching AI automation consultancies, productized services, or indie SaaS tools. What’s driving the shift? Cooper’s journey from product manager to entrepreneur captures all three forces colliding at once. After being laid off from Amex in 2024, he found himself doing gig work to stay afloat — until he decided to build something of his own: Smartify AI, a consulting agency helping small and mid-sized businesses automate workflows and customer engagement with AI tools. What surprised Cooper most wasn’t the leap into entrepreneurship. It was how prepared he already was. “My product background is definitely my secret sauce,” he explained. “When a client comes to me saying, ‘I want AI to do this, this, and that,’ I can see through the noise. I know how to frame a problem, validate it, and build iteratively instead of over-engineering.” Every skill that makes PMs effective in organizations (discovery, prioritization, customer empathy, hypothesis testing) becomes an unfair advantage when building your own business. That combination is exactly what makes going from product manager to entrepreneur not just possible, but powerful. Cooper’s story isn’t a LinkedIn success reel. It’s a crash course in humility. When he was first laid off, he admits, “I felt like a failure. I’d been a PM for nearly 10 years and suddenly I was driving Uber to make ends meet.” That raw honesty resonated with product leaders everywhere. The truth is, the from product manager to entrepreneur journey almost always starts with uncertainty, not funding. Many PMs are wired for systems and predictability; entrepreneurship is the opposite. Cooper leaned on what PMs do best: structured learning. He spent a month immersing himself in no-code tools like Make.com and n8n, experimenting with automation workflows, voice agents, and AI assistants. Then, he landed his first client, a startup building the “GolfNow of pickleball.” From there, referrals snowballed. His key lesson? Momentum compounds faster than confidence. Build something small, ship it, and let outcomes rebuild belief. Ask any founder and they’ll tell you, getting clients is one thing, keeping up with them is another. Even after Smartify AI crossed $30K MRR, Cooper found himself trapped in the classic founder paradox: “I needed to hire help to grow, but I couldn’t hire until I grew.” The grind of going from product manager to entrepreneur often comes down to managing three overlapping systems: This is where experienced PMs have an edge. We know how to systematize, prioritize, and measure what matters. But make no mistake: founder life replaces Jira tickets with invoices, and stakeholder meetings with late-night problem-solving. Once you’ve survived the first year, something shifts. The same frameworks PMs use to guide product growth now guide business growth. Cooper uses his own version of a product roadmap to track his company’s milestones. Weekly sprints? Still there. Retrospectives? Absolutely. Only now, the “users” are clients, the “features” are services, and the “product” is the business itself. As AI consulting matures, he’s turning Smartify AI’s internal playbooks (like his VoiceMail Pro voice agent) into standalone products. That’s where the from product manager to entrepreneur evolution comes full circle: from managing someone else’s roadmap to owning your own. And for product leaders reading this, that’s the deeper takeaway: you already have the mindset, frameworks, and rigor of a founder. What you might lack is permission to start. If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur, Cooper’s advice is deceptively simple: Join our newsletter and stay up to date with all things current and Product Management related. © 2025 Productside.

AI continues to ripple through the corporate world, with bosses eager to boost productivity and workers equally eager for tools that make their jobs easier. But as many AI pilots flop, the demand for employees who can actually apply the technology effectively has never been higher. That’s why Cisco is leaning on its workforce rather than cutting it. Unlike peers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture—who have trimmed staff—Cisco is investing in skilling up the employees it already has. “I don’t want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,” CEO Chuck Robbins said to CNBC in August. “I don’t want to get rid of engineers. I just want our engineers we have today to innovate faster and be more productive.” In practice, that’s meant in part giving developers access to AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. Already, about 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log in to AI coding tools at least once a month, and nearly a quarter of the company’s code is AI-generated—up from just 4% a year ago, according to Fletcher Previn, Cisco’s chief information officer. Internally, Cisco leaders are expected to pursue AI learning, in part because employees whose managers use AI are twice as likely to adopt it themselves, Scott McGuckin, Cisco’s global head of talent acquisition, told Fortune. And for those who do embrace the technology, the benefits are obvious. “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company,” McGuckin said. “Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” While tech companies are expected to slow their hiring as AI makes existing roles more productive, McGuckin said the war for talent remains competitive—and AI adoption is a top market differentiator. “For technical hires today, we look for relevant coding and engineering skills, which vary. Some of our coveted AI skill sets lie in AI and machine learning foundations and data science. Having these hard skills are a baseline to most applied roles,” he added. When push comes to shove, what really moves the needle in the hiring process is showing knowledge of AI in context, like responsible AI, ethics in bias detection, and explainability, McGuckin said. But for entry-level talent, that doesn’t mean you even need a degree. Demonstrating skills through coursework, research, or independent projects is often enough. In fiscal year 2023, 30% of Cisco’s entry-level hires were degreeless—something the company plans to expand upon. Cisco’s efforts are part of an industrywide movement to upskill workers for the AI era. In a recent report from the AI Workforce Consortium—led by Cisco and joined by Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP—it was found that seven out of 10 of the fastest-growing information and communications technology jobs were AI-related. The group also published a catalog of nearly 250 learning recommendations and an AI skills glossary to help workers navigate how to stay competitive in their field. Still, AI’s arrival hasn’t been without headaches. The hiring process has been infiltrated by fake candidates, often tied to North Korea. One report found that the number of companies that hired North Korean software developers grew a staggering 220% in the past year. Broadly speaking, McGuckin said Cisco has made vigilance a priority, increasing verification steps during the hiring process, including enhanced background checks that may involve an in-person component. “We want to assure all our applicants that there’s nothing they need to do differently when applying through Cisco’s talent portal—they are not losing out to fake candidates,” he said. “We feel the onus is on us, or employers at large, to create a safe and trustworthy candidate experience.” For Cisco, the challenge is straightforward: keep pace with AI’s rapid acceleration while making sure the people building it are both skilled—and real.

IBM's chief scientist has advice for recent grads hoping to land a software engineering job: Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after. "Don't just go for the standard 'I'm going to go and work for Google, Microsoft, IBM,'" Ruchir Puri told Business Insider. Puri, who has spent over three decades at IBM, said that as AI reshapes every industry, software engineers are needed across all sectors — whether that's transportation, manufacturing, or retail. He said job seekers should widen their search "beyond a narrow set of technology companies" and also consider the "massive enterprise landscape." For example, a company like John Deere, the world's largest agricultural equipment manufacturer, may not be top of mind for a software engineer looking for a job. However, Puri said the company is a household name, making a measurable impact. Other similar companies are hiring software engineers to help drive industry transformation, and being a part of that work can feel fulfilling, he said. "You are impacting something that is fundamental to global economy — and it's not just about technology," Puri said. Puri's comments come as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said in a CNBC interview that the company planned to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. However, new graduates are generally entering a challenging market. An August Handshake report found that job postings on the platform decreased by over 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, competition soared, with the average number of applications per job up by 26% year-over-year. Software engineering in general has undergone a shake-up in recent years. A saturated talent pool paired with rapid AI adoption has created an environment of uncertainty in hiring. While the tech industry is investing heavily in AI development, companies in the sector have also conducted consistent layoffs over the past few years. Giants like Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon all made cuts in 2025. Earlier this month, IBM announced it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter, impacting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce," a spokesperson told Business Insider. Krishna said in the CNBC interview that the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. Puri said that now is a good time for entry-level candidates to expand their view when it comes to finding meaningful work. "The world is your oyster," Puri said. "There are lots of companies in the world. All of them are looking to transform themselves with AI." Are you struggling to find a software engineering job? We want to hear from you.

Oracle stock crashes 25% in a month, wiping out billions in market value as investors panic over rising AI costs, shrinking margins, and slower cloud growth. Shares have slid to around $236, one of tech’s steepest monthly drops. Reports of a $100 million Nvidia chip rental loss and heavy data center spending have fueled fears of profit erosion. Bloomberg and Stocktwits both confirmed that Oracle’s AI-focused cloud push, while growing fast, has been far less profitable than expected. Once racing toward the $1 trillion club, Oracle now faces a harsh reality check — prove AI growth can pay off or risk deeper losses.

Title: The difficulty of tracking and interpreting AI usage labels

by Tom Johnson on Nov 12, 2025 comments categories: ai Tracking and communicating AI usage in docs turns out to be not only challenging technically, but also potentially full of interpretive pitfalls. There seems to be a double-edged sword at work. On the one hand, we want to track the degree to which AI is being used in doc work so we can quantify, measure, and evaluate the impact of AI. On the other hand, if a tech writer calls out that they used AI for a documentation changelist, it might falsely create the impression that AI did all the work, reducing the value of including the human at all. In this post, I'll explore these dilemmas. Reasons to track AI usage Identifying AI-written content improves the review Problems with identifying AI usage AI fluency is an underrated skill Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail Conclusion Works Cited Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. Reasons to track AI usage First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. Identifying AI-written content improves the review There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Problems with identifying AI usage Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: Because this changelist has an AI-generated label, I assume AI created the content. If AI is creating this content, why am I paying a tech writer here? I should instead be buying more AI chips. Conclusion: Let’s reroute the money to AI chips instead of tech writer salaries. This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. AI fluency is an underrated skill Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Conclusion Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.

I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.
