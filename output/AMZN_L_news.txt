By Dade Hayes Business Editor In addition to its main purpose as a showcase for the latest gadgets, CES has long been a meeting ground for entertainment players. This year’s edition, getting under way Monday in Las Vegas, will be no exception and is unfolding amid an elevated sense of urgency for traditional media companies to get right with the lords of technology. With theatrical box office and linear television in decline and layoffs continuing to thin the industry’s ranks, tech provides in some ways a welcome source of optimism despite its many complications and a culture still distinct from Hollywood’s. Related Stories News E! News Viewership Up 50% Across Digital & Social Platforms In 2024 News 2024 U.S. Box Office Finals At $8.7 Billion: How The Studios Stand On top of CES mainstays like Sony, Panasonic and other hardware firms holding court again with massive booths, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and SAG-AFTRA are among those with a presence. NBCUniversal, Amazon, Roku and Fox Corp. are among many making announcements and having execs on panels. Two of the confab’s handful of keynote speeches are by the CEOs of SiriusXM and Nvidia. The latter company, which has had a meteoric rise to a $3.5 trillion market cap, is more than 30 years old but until recent years hasn’t been thought of as particularly connected with Hollywood. Its AI chips and technology are now central to animation, special effects and many other parts of the industry. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who took one of history’s biggest swings at CES by unveiling the venture-funded (and ultimately short-lived) streaming startup Quibi there in 2020, is returning to help kick off OpenAP’s Audience Summit. The industry consortium’s half-day event will feature high-level execs (Amazon’s Krishan Bhatia, Fox Corp.’s Jeff Collins and TelevisaUnivision’s Donna Speciale among them) discussing the challenges and opportunities of streaming. Michael Kassan, former head of MediaLink, will once again preside as a panel moderator and connector via his new company, 3C Ventures. The exec had a bitter and public breakup with UTA, which acquired MediaLink and then fell out with Kassan. The two have exchanged lawsuits. UTA and MediaLink, for their part, are also making the scene in Las Vegas, hosting a party with a musical performance by Meghan Trainor. Advertising has become a key theme at CES as dollars continue to shift from traditional buckets into digital and streaming. “It’s like a kickoff to the upfronts,” NBCU head of advertising and partnerships Mark Marshall told Deadline in an interview. “We really start our upfront conversations at CES, so it has been a priority for us.” NBCU is looking to build interest across a number of major tentpoles heading toward the company’s 100th anniversary in fall 2026. “We’re really looking at ’25 and ’26 as one thing,” Marshall said. A new edition of BravoCon, golf’s Ryder Cup, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, the 60th Super Bowl, the NBA’s return; the FIFA World Cup on Telemundo – “All of those things were not on NBC in this upfront,” he noted, meaning the next one “will be a massive one for us.” Disney, similarly, has positioned its prelude to the upfronts, the Global Tech + Data Showcase, as an annual live CES presentation, delivered by livestream to those not in Las Vegas. “We have really invested, over the last decade, in technology that differentiates us from all of our traditional competitors,” Disney President of Global Advertising Rita Ferro explained in a recent in-house interview. “We can also compete with any of the new technology platforms, and what sets us apart across all of those is truly our scale. The ability to have the amount of content that we have across sports, which is a hugely popular marketplace right now in terms of advertisers and where they’re spending their dollars, is also a differentiator.” WBD, meanwhile, has also been ramping up its brand efforts on Max, deploying sponsor integrations and targeted advertising. The third season of HBO’s White Lotus, which will premiere in mid-February, is the focus of a “Taste of Thailand” party at CES, complete with a synergistic cooking demonstration by a Food Network chef preparing the cuisine of this season’s setting. Analysts looking at the intersection of entertainment and technology continue to see upside for the companies that manage to make the most of shifting consumer habit. Tim Nollen of Macquarie last month took note of a study by the Association of National Advertisers showing year-over-year improvements in the ad value chain. “Ad tech is becoming more efficient,” Nollen wrote, with figures in the report that “seem to point to an ad tech market that is growing up, with scaled players accruing benefits.” Technology has undeniable allure, but it is also a complex force for creative stakeholders in film, TV and streaming. SAG-AFTRA, which seized on AI as a key issue in its 2023 strike against studios and streamers, is back at CES for its annual LIT Conference, short for “labor innovation and technology.” Duncan Crabtree, SAG-AFTRA’s National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, will speak at the event, as will DGA National Executive Director Russell Hollander and senior officials from the WGA, IATSE and other guilds.

Title: Here's what to expect for raises, promotions, and job-seeking in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-05T09:16:01Z

Getting a job was tough for many Americans in 2024. If a career shift is your New Year's resolution for 2025, you might still find it challenging. Job growth has slowed, unemployment has been historically low but rising, and unemployed Americans are staying jobless for longer. "Heading into 2025, it is going to be a little harder for job seekers across the board," Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in December. "We've seen that just about every category on Indeed has come down year over year in terms of the number of job postings. So that suggests that employer demand has cooled." Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, described the labor market in 2024 as unusually stable and quiet. She pointed to steadily low layoffs and a drop in voluntary turnover amid cooler hiring. "The stasis is rather abnormal, and I think it's going to make it tough for workers who are looking for new opportunities to find them," Richardson said. Here's what economists expect when it comes to job searches, wages and promotions, and other aspects of work life in 2025. One reason it would be hard for job searchers to land a job is that employers may want to see which policies Donald Trump pursues early in his second term. "While business sentiment has picked up somewhat since the election, there is still a lot of uncertainty about future policy changes that will likely make businesses hesitant to ramp up hiring, particularly in the first half of 2025," Dante DeAntonio, a labor economist with Moody's Analytics, said in a written statement. A crackdown on immigration could affect industries with higher shares of immigrant workers, like the construction sector. DeAntonio said those industries "may find themselves scrambling for workers if material changes to immigration policy are enacted." DeAntonio identified the leisure and hospitality industry and agriculture as two others that have historically depended on immigrant labor and could be affected by changes. The new administration could also affect government workers and job seekers. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is figuring out suggestions for cutting federal spending and regulations. "A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy," Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed article published by The Wall Street Journal. Employment growth in the federal government has cooled. From November 2022 to November 2023 the federal government added 77,000 jobs, but it added just 49,000 over the following year. "Depending on how things go with the new administration, we may see a lot of government workers either losing their jobs or quitting," said Brian Rose, a senior US economist for UBS's chief investment office. "This could be an opportunity for private-sector companies to pick up some skilled workers." Richardson said white-collar job seekers, like those searching for tech roles, should be ready to network and wait longer to get a job. "It's not that these jobs don't exist, and it's not that there's not opportunities out there, but the opportunities that people had gotten used to prior to 2024 have slowed," Richardson said. "This economy coming out of the pandemic really thrived on tech jobs." DeAntonio said white-collar industries were "likely to remain at the top of the list as difficult for job seekers to enter, as those firms have been some of the most cautious in terms of hiring." Stahle said lots of jobs were still available in construction and manufacturing, even if opportunities have slowed from a year or two ago. But Stahle said jobs in software development, marketing, and other knowledge work were "hit much harder" by the job-market slowdown. "I think it's going to continue to be kind of a divergence in the labor market where some job seekers will have an easy time next year, albeit a little harder than last year, and then some are going to have a harder time than they've had in a few years," Stahle said in an interview in 2024. Rose said the difficulty of landing work depended on a person's job experience and field of work. While hiring might be rough in finance and tech, construction is one industry that needs workers. Rose said construction and skilled workers for smaller companies were in high demand. He said he also thinks lower-paying jobs are in demand. "If you're in healthcare or the skilled trades, you're in the right place," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said. "If you're anywhere else, you might want to reevaluate your career choices and look into reskilling and broadening your search." Healthcare has had large job growth relative to other industries and has largely maintained its growth rate even as broader hiring has slowed. Richardson sees a hopeful outlook for the interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, as the Federal Reserve has cut rates in its past few meetings. "As we're seeing the Fed continue to try to draw down rates, manufacturing might benefit from that, and new sources of technology and tech advancement, that leads to more hiring in the sector," Richardson said. In December, AT&T said it wanted its office workers fully back to the workplace. Amazon also told employees they needed to fully work from the office, but it has delayed the January 2 deadline for some. "We are likely to see a continuation of the mixed bag of workplace policy changes that occurred this year," DeAntonio said. "Some firms will undoubtedly make a stronger return-to-office push, especially now as workers seem less inclined to switch jobs as they have in recent years." Despite those moves, the share of white-collar employees working outside the office has risen. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 46% of workers in management, business, and financial-operations occupations worked remotely at least part of the time in November, up from 41% a year earlier. Stahle described the outlook for raises, compensation, and promotions as promising. But he added that "we don't want to see wages necessarily pick up to a point where they could fuel inflation." Stahle argued that hiring needed to pick up, particularly for roles that haven't had robust growth, to have a soft landing, where inflation slows to the Fed's 2% target while unemployment and layoffs stay steady. "We want to see people continuing to have decent wage growth, especially wage growth that keeps their purchasing power up and above inflation," Stahle said. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings was 4% in November, down from the growth rate in 2022 and the roughly 4.4% increase at the start of the year, though it has outpaced cooling inflation since mid-2023. Rose said he thought wage growth would most likely moderate further. "There's just better balance in the labor market so less need for companies to raise their wages to attract workers," Rose said. But DeAntonio said immigration policy changes could make the labor market even tighter, which would "increase leverage for employees in seeking bigger pay increases." Stahle said the job market could be challenging for young people. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates — people who are 22 to 27 — has been ticking up, but it falls short of the rate for those without a degree in this age group. Rose said he thought that "recent college grads who went to some private college and spent a lot of money and looking for a high-paying, entry-level job to justify that investment" were having a tough time in the job market.

Title: How My 2024 Predictions Went – And Some Predictions for 2025

EditorEconomy Kurt Schlichter, The Burning Platform Guest Post by Kurt Schlichter The Burning Platform In my January 1, 2024, column entitled “Top Twenty Terrible Predictions for 2024,” I noted that, “Every year, I offer you my predictions for the coming trip around the Sun, and every year, I’m mostly wrong.” Back then, I predicted that “I think [2024] will be a disaster.” Shows what I know. Personally, I had two houses flood from broken plumbing and practically became a general contractor. That sucked. But in the macro, it was a pretty good year for America. I predicted that “Trump is not going to be subject to any federal trials this year…. The state cases might, but they are idiotic too.” I also predicted that “the 14th Amendment nonsense is going to get shot down. I thought Hunter would plead out. As expected, Joe Biden was “not held accountable for his crimes.” Then there was this: “I really like Ron DeSantis, but there’s a significant chance that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee.” Oh, but then I ruined it by predicting that “if he is the nominee, he picks Nikki Haley and, for reasons I will set out in an upcoming Townhall column, that’s a good idea…from his perspective.” Boy, did that column stir the pot! I also correctly predicted that “she’ll continue to spew consultant-generated corporate-friendly cliches and hack talking points as she seeks to turn back the clock on Republicanism twenty years.” I predicted that “Israel is going to rout Hamas,” but also that “there will be some sort of talks to resolve the Ukraine open wound.” I was right that “the Houthis will continue to humiliate America and will be on the receiving end of a few puny airstrikes.” At home, I foresaw leftist riots. Those did not happen. I predicted that “the border crisis will continue unabated,” and Biden pretended to abate it a little bit. I also correctly saw that “the GOP squish caucus will enter into a compromise to solve it.” Senator Jim Amnesty Lankford makes an appearance in my “Biggest Idiots of 2024” column. I was right that we would win the Senate but wrong when I predicted that “we will lose the House because we are Republicans and Republicans are stupid.” In fact, we won it, barely, because Republicans are stupid. I was wrong when I predicted a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled by “a pinko BIPOC differently-abled nonbinary two-spirit of heft.” I was right when I predicted that wokeness would peak and begin to decline. I was right that “the women’s Olympic medals will all be won by men, proving that men are better than women at everything, including being women.” I was also right that “the Regime Media will suffer more layoffs and bankruptcies, and there will be much rejoicing.” I expected the football guy to dump Taylor Swift. I don’t know whether that happened or not. I was doing pretty well until I got here: “Joe Biden is not going to be replaced, and he will be on the ballot in November. I’m not sure if he’ll know it, though. Man, picking Kamala Harris was the greatest insurance policy anybody ever took out.” I further opined that “the Democrats will win in November.” In my defense, I said that hoping “my track record of being wrong about my predictions holds up.” It held up, thankfully. Here’s what I think will happen in 2025: Once again, see you in 12 months, assuming these idiots have not caused a nuclear and/or civil war in the meantime so that I can give you some more inevitably wrong predictions for 2026.

Title: The End Of Management? Gen Z Faces New Challenges In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/01/03/the-end-of-management-gen-z-faces-new-challenges-in-2025/

Gen Z faces the disappearance of management jobs in 2025. In 2025, it’s predicted that 1 in 10 management roles will be filled by Gen Z. But that’s a complicated statistic, when management jobs are going the way of the milk man and the fax machine. Forbes highlights the stark reality of white-collar job cuts, with middle-management positions being systematically eliminated at organizations like Google, Meta, UPS and others. Indeed, middle management positions accounted for nearly a third of layoffs in 2023, according to reports from Live Data Technologies. That’s bad news for Gen Z workers seeking guidance, mentoring and oversight. Or a white-collar job in management. Is management a disappearing career? CNBC reports that Amazon is shifting to an individual-contributor model - a type of unbossing that could foster the elimination of as many as 14,000 management roles. Other companies are making similar moves on a smaller scale, cutting into the middle to improve the bottom line. What’s really at work here? Is AI making middle management positions redundant? “Digital transformation plays a significant role,” according to Joseph Roh, a professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University who commented on the unbossing trend on CNBC. “Automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software.” While management is disappearing, employee engagement is suffering. Gallup notes that the connection between employees and managers is a driving force behind performance and employee wellbeing, stating that “the role of the manager has never been more important”. But is it really? The crisis for Gen Z isn’t that thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. The key takeaway here is that these jobs don’t really exist anymore. Is it any wonder that employee engagement is in the ditch, and Forbes reports that 52% of Gen Z workers don’t want to be middle managers? Self-leadership is the direction for Gen Z, but navigating without guidance might be the real challenge. In a Harris poll, 82% of managers said that Gen Z new hires need more training in soft skills. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of Gen Z employees say that these highly-desired soft skills can’t be taught, and can only be developed by watching more seasoned employees over time. A Catch-22 is the result of these mutually conflicting conditions. It’s the classic chicken and the egg paradox: how do you gain valuable experience without the opportunity to gain valuable experience? Or be managed by those who can share it? The Harris Poll revealed that over half of Gen Z employees feel underprepared for professional roles, citing a lack of soft-skill training during their formative years (read: COVID). How do you demonstrate what you have not observed, learned or experienced? Over half of Gen Z employees say that a lack of interpersonal training makes them afraid of “asking dumb questions”. According to the survey, nearly 60% of Gen Z employees don’t know who to turn to for help with their soft skills. Perhaps because their manager was recently fired? Linda Jingfang Cai, VP of talent development at LinkedIn, told Fortune that soft skills are “the currency of the future workplace”. She said that any company helmed by people who don’t prioritize empathy and connection will lose out on this vital currency. As AI further integrates itself into business operations, soft skills are becoming more significant in 2025. Think judgment, teamwork, and articulating a vision—even a vision for the next phase of AI. Coaching can augment unknowns, accelerate experience and provide a safe space for “dumb questions”. Here are three actionable ways coaching can help: For Gen Z, the workplace of 2025 is a crucible of opportunity and challenge - with more of the latter inhibiting the former. If engagement and performance are going to be a part of the future of work, individuals and organizations have to access new skills, now. Self-leadership has never been more important than it is now. That trend is only going to continue in the age of AI. Through a commitment to coaching and skill-building, Gen Z and employers can bridge the management gap - and be better prepared for the future of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Rivian stock surges to start the year on better-than-expected EV deliveries

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year. Rivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. After its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive. Even with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier. Rivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.” Rivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.

Title: Secret Level asked Microsoft about an awesome Halo and Doom crossover — "Crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood," but Microsoft said: "Nah."

An interview with the creators of Secret Level revealed how crossover episode pitches to id Software and Microsoft fell flat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I still remember when I first heard about Xbox making a Halo TV show. I'm not reminiscing about when the Paramount TV show was announced, but when they first mentioned that Steven Spielberg would be directing it in 2013. An entire decade before. It was around the time of the Xbox One announcement and launch. The Halo TV show was part of the whole "all your entertainment in a single box" push. It was meant to usher in a new age at Microsoft, one that focused on programming and content for the customer. After years of hearing, "Don't worry, the Halo show is still coming," we were finally blinded by Master Cheeks. Halo fans around the globe held their gaming controllers, hoping for a cinematic Master Piece. What they received was a show that not only missed the spirit of the franchise but somehow failed to even make a decent sci-fi series.Once I heard the helmet was coming off, it was like I heard the sounds of distant Plasma Grenades echoing across the city. Lore was ignored or replaced, and we ended up with a weird romance being pitched between Master Chief and someone who wasn't Cortana. It's one of the easiest things to get right. I guess that's what made the following news all the more confusing to me. In an interview with Collider, Tim Miller and Dave Wilson, the men behind the new TV show Secret Level, revealed a few interesting tidbits that definitely caused some sore necks from the massive head turn we all did. For those unaware, Secret Level is an animated anthology series that covers the worlds of 15 different video games. Led in production by Blur Studios and Amazon MGM Studios, the series saw Pac-Man, Warhammer, Sifu, and more make the cut in the first season. It's what didn't show up that people found rather baffling. When asked whether the showrunners went after certain games, Tim Miller responded with, "I get a little chafed when I read online, and they're like, 'Hold on, these assholes took Spelunky when they could have taken Halo?' Or something like that. I'm like, 'Man, you think that we didn't talk to Halo or something?'" Dave Wilson continued later, "The creative director at ID [Software] is a good friend of ours, and so are folks at Microsoft, so we made a big plea because one of the things both Tim and I would love to do is do something that isn't currently available in the games, like crossovers. We wanted to make a Master Chief/Doom Slayer crossover episode, and I spent a whole weekend crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood. And it's exactly what Tim said; they were like, 'Nah.'" Excuse me? Microsoft said what? You had showrunners who were absolutely enthralled with the world of Halo and Doom and wanted to make something extraordinary, and you said no? Not to mention, with Blur Studios leading development, a studio that has already worked on multiple Halo games, you could have had the easiest Stick of your life. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Okay, I get it. You just released your Halo show you've been grinding to get done for almost a decade, and it bombed to the point of cancellation. Maybe you're a little Battle Rifle shy at the moment, but would it really have been any worse than what we got? Off the heels of the Halo TV show and layoffs at 343 Industries, Halo desperately needs a W. Even if a potential Halo and Doom crossover episode finds mixed reviews, it would already be infinitely better than what Paramount produced, but maybe that's the issue. Can Microsoft allow someone else to make a Halo TV show at the moment? After Paramounts failure, a successful spinoff like Secret Level could ruin the relationship between the two companies. While Halo failed, Microsoft has found success with Amazon and its award-winning take on Fallout. Netflix is also currently working on multiple Gears of War projects; there are plenty of IPs Microsoft has yet to explore. It's never a good idea to burn any bridges with a potential future partner on a project down the road. Even though Master Sheets didn't do so well with audiences, that doesn't mean Paramount is empty of video game-adapting talent. You only need to look at Sonic's success to see that (Don't look at the early trailers). Respect the source material, and it's pretty damn easy to find success. Gamers aren't a mystery. Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over sillier things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise that was worldly beloved? Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over more childish things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise, which was a box-office record-setter? At the end of the day, the fans of the series still deserve better. How freaking awesome would it be to see the Doom Slayer and Master Chief ripping apart flood-infested demons to save the human race? You could do it with minimal dialogue, too, where Chief calls out, "I need a weapon," and Doomguy tosses him a BFG with a nod. This writes itself, people! After slaying the demon race and protecting humanity once more, Chief reports back to base for a briefing, and Doomguy goes into cryo while stealing Chief's line, "Wake me when you need me." I didn't even realize how sad this whole thing was until I started writing this fanfic. Is it too late to petition Microsoft to say yes for the second season? At least the Halo Infinite storyline is pretty decent. What do you think? Let us know below or on social media. I'll be checking out the replies and conversing with anyone that wants to. If you're like me, you'll also daydream up some astonishing moments with cliche dialogue that seels the entire thing.

The deal expands Stagwell’s Code and Theory Network’s presence in the Middle East. Stagwell has entered an agreement to acquire Dubai-based strategic digital communications agency Create Group. The agreement between the two firms was made on December 23. The deal would add Create Group to Stagwell’s Code and Theory Network, the holding company’s technology-first group designed to navigate changing consumer behaviors, emerging technologies and AI, according to Stagwell. The network includes flagship agency Code and Theory, as well as creative and marketing shops Instrument, Kettle, Left Field Labs, TrueLogic, Rhythm and Mediacurrent. The addition of Create Group aligns with Stagwell’s continued expansion in the Middle East and North Africa following the recent acquisitions of government advisory consultancy Consulum and influencer agency Leaders in July. Create Group CEO and founder Tom Otton will continue to lead the agency, which will be integrated into Stagwell’s Code and Theory Network. The agency will retain its name and branding once the acquisition is completed, according to Stagwell. The combined entity will comprise 2,000 team members worldwide under the leadership of Code and Theory Network founder and executive chairman Dan Gardner and CEO Michael Treff. No layoffs occurred as a result of the acquisition. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Create Group marks the 11th acquisition for Stagwell and its subsidiary of agencies this year. In addition to the Code and Theory Network, the holding company houses PR firms Allison, KWT Global, SKDK, PRophet, Sloane & Company and Veritas. Earlier this month, Stagwell added global media monitoring analytics platform Unicepta to Stagwell Marketing Cloud’s PRophet comms tech suite. This year, Stagwell added predictive brand technology platform Bera to its advisory firm, The Harris Poll, as well as Business Traveller to travel media company Ink. The holding company also acquired Montreal-based Luxine Relations Publiques, joining the company’s subsidiary Veritas Communications, as well as Brazil-based Pros Agency and U.K. agency collective Sidekick, both added to Allison’s portfolio. Other additions include creative agency Team Epiphany, added to Constellation’s network of agencies, followed by France-based shop What’s Next Partners. Create Group is headquartered in the United Arab Emirates with additional offices in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The agency offers expertise in digital strategy, products, content and innovation. Clients include the Department of Culture & Tourism in Abu Dhabi, Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, Sony Pictures, Volkswagen Middle East, COP29, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Neom. Stagwell acquired a majority stake in Code and Theory in 2016. Code and Theory Network’s portfolio of clients include Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, MSNBC, NFL, Pfizer and Zappos, among others.
