In February 2017, for the first time in its long history, the Washington Post adopted an official slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” The motto was a little bit much. Pompous and self-important, it sounded as if the newspaper was really trying to say Without the Washington Post, we’re all screwed. At the time, plenty of rival news outlets—including Slate—ribbed the Post for its portentousness. Democracy Dies in Darkness. OK, guys. Thank God we’ve got George Will to keep the lamps lit for us. And yet, in the years that followed, the Post more or less lived up to the slogan’s implied mandate: to shine a bright light on an ethically bankrupt president and his clown-car administration. Under the editorial leadership of ex–Boston Globe chief Marty Baron and the financial stewardship of its owner, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, the Post excelled during the first Trump administration, buoyed by a tide of subscribers eager to have Donald Trump’s feet held to the fire. From 2016 through 2021, the newspaper turned out lots of great journalism that illuminated the depths of Trump’s self-dealing. From David Fahrenthold’s coverage of Trump’s alleged charitable giving to the paper’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the Post rose to its own challenge and generated what was arguably the newspaper’s best body of work since the Watergate era. The Post’s keen focus on Trump and his many lickspittles wasn’t just a case of “Trump derangement syndrome.” It was an editorial strategy that was required by a historic moment. The president’s unfitness for office was the era’s most important story, and as D.C.’s hometown newspaper, the Post was obliged to cover it from every possible angle. For Bezos, it surely didn’t hurt that this editorial strategy also made good business sense: In 2019, CNN reported that “the Post went from hemorrhaging advertising revenue to becoming a profitable business in 2016, and continuing to be profitable not just in 2017, but also in 2018.” Trump left town in disgrace in January 2021, seemingly bound for an ignominious retirement. In his inauguration speech, Trump’s successor, “Amtrak” Joe Biden, announced that “democracy had prevailed.” It had, albeit briefly—and by shining its light so vividly for so long on Trump and his cronies, the Post deserved a small share of the credit. Times have changed. It is now 2025, Trump is back in office, and Washington Post readers are learning to their horror that darkness isn’t the only condition under which democracy can die. Sometimes, it also dies at the hands of people like Jeff Bezos: pragmatic oligarchs with diversified business portfolios who ultimately care less about defending democracy than about not losing money by doing so. For the past year or so, and certainly ever since it became clear that the Democrats were waging an uphill battle in the 2024 presidential election, Bezos has been conspicuously remaking the Post into an entity that seems primarily focused on not antagonizing Donald Trump. In the process, he has hollowed out the editorial staff and squandered the journalistic legacy that makes the Washington Post worth owning and operating in the first place. On Wednesday, various outlets reported that Bezos had informed Post staffers that the newspaper’s opinion section would thenceforth be focusing on “personal liberty and free markets.” Claiming that the internet had obviated the daily newspaper’s previous responsibility to offer “a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,” Bezos argued that “free markets and personal liberties are right for America,” and that he was excited for Post Opinion to focus on those topics going forward—as opposed to, you know, the jackbooted horrors of the second Trump administration. (“Bravo, @JeffBezos!” wrote Elon Musk on the website formerly known as Twitter.) The announcement was just the latest humiliating turn in the newspaper’s depressing recent narrative of ownership-driven decline. In 2023, amid a reported $77 million loss, the paper shed hundreds of jobs through a combination of layoffs and buyouts, which may have saved Bezos some money, but which also inevitably affected the paper’s ability to produce the sort of wide-ranging, high-quality journalism that made it worth reading in the first place. In 2024, to help turn the paper’s financial tide, Bezos installed some nitwit from Great Britain as publisher, who buzzed in with a bunch of stupid ideas about newsroom reorganization; drove off the paper’s relatively new editor in chief, Sally Buzbee; and attempted to stop the Post from covering his own alleged involvement in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. In October of last year, under Bezos’ direct instructions, the Post editorial board refrained from endorsing a presidential candidate, a cowardly decision that led a quarter-million Post readers to cancel their subscriptions. In January, the New York Times reported that the Post had internally debuted a new motto, one that was much less strident than its public-facing slogan: “Riveting Storytelling for All of America.” The All in that motto tells the tale, with its tacit implication that the newspaper’s previous focus on carefully reported and argued stories and columns that reflected poorly on Donald Trump was only for part of America—the liberal part. Bezos’ unilateral remaking of the Post’s opinion section this week—the section’s editor, David Shipley, resigned upon receiving the mandate, and he really had no other choice—is of a piece with all these other moves. Taken together, it starts to seem clear that, for Bezos, the Post has become a pawn in a much larger game. I don’t think that Bezos is neutering the Post because he’s suddenly gone full MAGA, or because he honestly believes that the newspaper’s ideal editorial strategy involves driving away its best reporters and columnists while mimicking the worst parts of CNN and the Wall Street Journal. I think he’s making moves with an eye toward mollifying an intensely vindictive president and thus improving the near-term fate of his other, much more prominent business ventures. If the Post had a different, less flush owner, maybe you could be swayed by any of the woe-is-us C-suite wailing about the newspaper’s plummeting revenue, subscription, and traffic numbers. But Bezos has long been on the short list of the wealthiest people in human history, and he could afford to underwrite an optimal version of the Post in perpetuity and never notice a dent in his $220 billion personal fortune. He could, right now, choose to run the Post the way that Steve Cohen chooses to run the New York Mets: by throwing so much money at top talent that they can’t afford to not work there. (I myself do not fall into the “top editorial talent” category, but I would nevertheless gladly accept utility infielder money to step in and write occasional columns when the good reporters need days off.) This sort of benevolent stewardship was what lots of people hoped for when Bezos bought the Post from the storied Graham family in 2013, and by now it is unfortunately clear that Bezos has other ambitions. (The Graham Holdings Company owns Slate.) Given how his recent meddling has sunk the Post’s financial position even deeper, it’s hard to believe Bezos’ goal is really to get the Post to pay for itself. The Post doesn’t need to pay for itself as long as Bezos is around to pay for it; and even if it did, it’s hard to see how alienating existing customers while pandering to the sorts of people who hate the Washington Post is a viable long-term strategy. I think it’s more that Bezos is bent on ensuring that the Post’s political coverage does not endanger the profit potential of any of his other businesses. The Washington Post is a minor, minor component of Bezos’ business portfolio. Much more central to the billionaire’s past, present, and future fortune are the world-devouring Amazon.com and his spaceflight startup, Blue Origin. Trump’s return to office alongside the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Bezos and his other businesses. As Trump and Musk hollow out the federal government, they are leaving behind a massive void that will inevitably be filled by private industry. Services once provided by humans will start to be provided by A.I., a field in which Amazon has already invested billions. If the U.S. Postal Service is gutted, it will create additional opportunities for companies like Amazon with worldwide logistics infrastructures; if NASA and the Pentagon shrink, there’ll be more money to funnel to private contractors such as Blue Origin. The cuts that Musk and the Trump Cabinet are making represent a potential windfall for Bezos and his businesses—assuming, of course, that he’s able to stay on Trump’s good side. Robustly covering the many terrible things happening in the second Trump administration is a great way to get and stay on Trump’s bad side, though, and in order to understand why Bezos seems to be deliberately ruining the Washington Post, you need to view the changes he’s making there through that transactional lens. If Bezos plays nice with Trump by refocusing the Post’s coverage away from his administration, then maybe Trump’s Federal Trade Commission might even wind down its antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. If the Post were to double down on its prior hard coverage of the Trump administration, though, Bezos might end up frozen out of the private-industry gold rush that’s soon to come, and might have to keep dealing with antitrust suits for years. There’s a world of difference between the first Trump administration and the second, as we’re all now aware. Eight years ago, normal people were mostly shocked and angry that America elected such a narcissistic, incompetent boob to the presidency—and most of America’s business leaders chose to cater to this righteous anger. The Trump administration felt like a historical aberration, and thus there was no real business reason to normalize or collaborate with it. Today, though, the “resistance” is tapped out, the boobs are in ascendance, and Trumpism is no longer an aberration. Instead, it’s an opportunity space for Bezos, and Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg, and all the other craven big-money chickenshits to whom democracy only ever mattered as part of a marketing slogan. They will gladly help set the world on fire as long as they can bid on the contract to clear the debris. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: He quit his government job after 5 months for a higher-paying tech role. Here's how he marketed himself for the switch.

When Kunal Sonalkar graduated from the University of Florida in 2017 with a master's degree in computer science, his career aspiration was to be a data scientist at a Big Tech company. But he soon found out it wasn't going to be easy to reach his goal. "Data science was a growing field then, and there weren't many entry-level roles for data scientists or machine learning engineers," Sonalkar told Business Insider. "I almost got no interview callbacks from the bigger firms." During a career fair, he met some recruiters from a state government agency focused on water resources, landed an interview, and was hired as an entry-level data analyst. While Sonalkar found his government job "super interesting" and appreciated the chance to work with brilliant environmental scientists, he felt constrained by the scale of his work. "I wanted to work on big data systems and large-scale projects, and I wasn't getting a chance to work on that," he said. Sonalkar also felt that despite his employer's desire to leverage technology, budget constraints often limited the government sector's ability to invest in new technologies and software. The compensation was also much lower than that of the private sector, which included company stocks and RSUs. After just five months in his government role, at age 26, Sonalkar decided to pivot to a private-sector job as a data science analyst at a retail healthcare company. His new role also came with a significant pay hike, and within one-and-a-half years, his salary was nearly 50% higher than that of his government job. After about two-and-a-half years at the healthcare company, he landed a data analytics and machine learning role at a supermarket chain. Today, the 32-year-old is a data scientist at Nordstrom. Sonalkar translated his government-sector accomplishments into measurable results that demonstrated his impact on efficiency, cost savings, and process improvements. For example, he worked on several initiatives that improved workflow processes at his government agency, saving his team many manual hours. "I quantified this project — how much manual effort did we reduce, what were the cost savings associated with this project, how did we use automation tools to improve the existing process — and showcased it in my résumé," he explained. His strategy was to search "[company name] + role + LinkedIn" to find people who were working or who had worked in the companies and roles he was interested in. After sending initial invites to these professionals, he set up a coffee chat and told them about his experiences and what exactly he was looking for in a new role. "You can build a strong network just by doing this," Sonalkar said. When working in the government agency, Sonalkar developed a complete module to automate the agency's reporting system. "When you highlight these large-scale projects, explaining how you navigated through them and what the tradeoffs and challenges were, it goes a long way with the hiring manager," he said. "These skills are highly valued in the private sector." There were also some things Sonalkar wished he had known before transitioning out of a government job. Sonalkar didn't realize that private sector jobs move much faster than government jobs, with a greater emphasis on quick decision-making and rapid implementation of new technologies. "On the government front, we used to experience this occasionally if there were floods or water issues in a county, but for the most part, it was smooth sailing," he said. "We used to have timelines for our deliverables, but nothing too crazy." Sonalkar quickly discovered that tech jobs require always remaining a student, constantly learning and upskilling yourself — something he personally enjoys and participates in. "I've been constantly enrolling myself in new courses," Sonalkar said, something his manager has been very supportive of. For example, Sonalkar learned Tableau and enrolled himself in certifications from Amazon Web Services, which taught him how to train and host AI models on their cloud platform. He's also recently taken courses on building generative AI applications, finetuning open-source AI models, and deploying these models into production environments. In the government sector, if Sonalkar's team wanted to try out a new technology, they had to make a very detailed case about why they needed that investment. He found this not to be the case in his non-government jobs. "The private sector is liberal, and you'll have room to try out new methods — fail faster and succeed sooner," he said. Sonalkar said he no longer struggles with the problems that government jobs often come with, like limited compensation and salary growth, slow decision-making processes, and inertia to change. However, he also acknowledged drawbacks of the private sector, such as shaky job security due to ongoing Big Tech layoffs and potentially longer working hours with stricter timelines, whereas government jobs traditionally have offered better work-life balance and a sense of public service. Sonalkar's aspirations to become a data scientist at a Big Tech company have evolved over time, thanks to his work with AI and machine learning methods at Nordstrom. "I feel retail — especially e-commerce — has a ton of applications to leverage some of the recent developments happening in AI," Sonalkar said. "Rather than focusing on where I work, I plan to prioritize the kind of work I'm doing." Sonalkar plans to remain in the private sector for the foreseeable future, but he doesn't view this as a permanent departure from public service. "AI can be a game-changer for government efficiency and service delivery," he said, pointing to uses such as optimizing resource allocation and improving citizen engagement. "Its successful implementation often requires the expertise and resources of the private sector," he said, adding that it's a public-private collaboration he'd be interested in helping facilitate.

Title: There Are No More Redlines
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/jeff-bezos-great-emboldening/681886/

Welcome to the Great Emboldening. When Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post almost 12 years ago, he went out of his way to assuage fears that he would turn the paper into his personal mouthpiece. “The values of The Post do not need changing,” he wrote at the time. “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.” For much of his tenure, Bezos kept that promise. On Wednesday, he betrayed it. In a statement posted on X, Bezos announced an overhaul of the Post’s opinion section, expressly limiting the ideology of the department and its writers: “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” In response, the Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, resigned. This is the second time in the past six months that Bezos has meddled in the editorial processes of the paper—and specifically its opinion page. In October, Bezos intervened to shut down the Post’s presidential-endorsement process, suggesting that the ritual was meaningless and would only create the perception of bias. Many criticized his decision as a capitulation to Donald Trump, though Bezos denied those claims. Several editorial-board members resigned in protest, and more than 250,000 people canceled their subscription to the paper in the immediate aftermath. Some interpreted this week’s announcement similarly, saying that the Amazon founder is bending the knee to the current administration; the Post’s former editor in chief, Marty Baron, told The Daily Beast that “there is no doubt in my mind that he is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests.” Bezos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chuck Todd: Jeff Bezos is blaming the victim Whatever Bezos’s personal reasons are, equally important is the fact that he is emboldened to interfere so brazenly. And he’s not alone. A broader change has been under way among the tech and political elite over the past year or so. Whether it’s Bezos remaking a major national paper in his image or Elon Musk tearing out the guts of the federal government with DOGE, bosses of all stripes are publicly and unapologetically disposing of societal norms and seizing control of institutions to orient the world around themselves. Welcome to the Great Emboldening, where ideas and actions that might have been unthinkable, objectionable, or reputationally risky in the past are now on the table. This dynamic has echoes of the first Trump administration. Trump’s political rise offered a salient lesson that shamelessness can be a superpower in a political era when attention is often the most precious resource. Trump demonstrated that distorting the truth and generating outrage results in a lot of attentional value: When caught in a lie, he doubled down, denied, and went on the offensive. As a result, he made the job of demanding accountability much harder. Scandals that might otherwise have been ruinous—the Access Hollywood tape, for example—were spun as baseless attacks from enemies. Trump commandeered the phrase fake news from the media and then turned it against journalists when they reported on his lies. These tactics were successful enough that they spawned a generation of copycats: Unscrupulous politicians and business leaders in places such as Silicon Valley now had a playbook to use against their critics and, following Trump’s election, a movement to back it. Wittingly or not, nobody embodied this behavior better than Musk, who has spent the past decade operating with a healthy contempt for institutions, any semblance of decorum, and the law. Read: The flattening machine Trump’s first term was chaotic and run like a reality-television show; as a policy maker, he was largely ineffectual, instead governing via late-night tweets, outlandish press conferences, and a revolving door of hirings, fallings-out, and firings. But it wasn’t until the 2020 election and the events leading up to January 6 that Trump truly attempted to subvert American democracy to retain power. Although he was briefly exiled from major social-media channels, Trump got away with it: The narrative around January 6 was warped by Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters, and he continued to lead the Republican Party. This, along with the success of Trump’s 2024 campaign—which was rooted in the promise of exercising extreme executive authority—was a signal to powerful individuals, including many technology executives and investors, that they could act however they pleased. Read: The internet is worse than a brainwashing machine Trump winning the popular vote in November only amplified this dynamic. CEOs including Mark Zuckerberg pledged to roll back past content-moderation reforms and corporate-inclusivity initiatives, viewed now as excesses of the coronavirus-pandemic emergency and an outdated regime of overreach. Bosses in Silicon Valley, who saw the social-justice initiatives and worker solidarity of the COVID crisis as a kind of mutiny, felt emboldened and sought to regain control over their workforce, including by requiring people to return to the office. Tech executives professed that they were no longer afraid to speak their mind. On X, the Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia (who now works for Musk’s DOGE initiative) described the late 2010s and the Joe Biden era as “a time of silence, shaming, and fear.” That people like Gebbia—former liberals who used to fall in line with the politics of their peers—are now supporting Trump, the entrepreneur wrote, is part of a broader “woke-up call.” The Great Emboldening has taken many forms. At the Los Angeles Times, the billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong paved the way for Bezos, spiking a Kamala Harris endorsement and pledging to restore ideological balance to the paper by hiring right-wing columnists and experimenting with building a “bias meter” to measure opinions in the paper’s news stories. For some far-right influencers, this supposed MAGA cultural shift offers little more than the ability to offend with no consequences. “It’s okay to say retard again. And that’s great,” one right-wing X personality posted in December. Musk and others, including Steve Bannon, have taken this a step further, making what appear to be Nazi salutes while mocking anyone in the media who calls them out. The DOGE incursion into the federal government is the single best example of the emboldening at work—a premeditated plan to remake the federal government by seizing control of its information and terrorizing its workforce with firings and bureaucratic confusion. It is a barely veiled show of strength that revolves largely around the threat of mass layoffs. Some of DOGE’s exploits, as with a few of Trump’s executive orders, may not be legal, and some have been stopped by federal judges. As my colleagues and I have reported, some DOGE staffers have entered offices and accessed sensitive government data without the proper clearances and background checks, and have bypassed security protocols without concern. But the second Trump administration operates as though it is unconcerned with abiding by the standards and practices of the federal government. Bezos’s long-term plans for the Post beyond overhauling its opinion section aren’t yet known. But the timing of his decision to change the direction of its op-ed coverage tracks with the behavior of his peers, many of whom are adhering to the tenets of the Elon Musk school of management. When Bezos acquired The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013, its value to the tech baron was largely reputational. The purchase solidified Bezos as a mogul and, perhaps just as important, as a steward and benefactor of an important institution. Not meddling in the paper’s editorial affairs wasn’t just a strategy born out of the goodness of his heart; it was a way to exercise power through benevolence. Bezos could be seen as one of the good guys, shepherding an institution through the perils of an internet age that he profited handsomely from. Even if he stewed privately at the paper’s “Democracy dies in darkness” pivot in the first Trump administration, stepping in to influence coverage likely would have felt like too big a risk—an untenable mixing of Church and state. But the DOGE era offers a permission structure. In a moment of deep institutional distrust, Trump 2.0 has tried to make the case that anything goes and that previously unthinkable uses of executive power—such as, say, dismantling USAID—may be possible, if executed with enough shamelessness and bravado. Bezos may or may not be turning the Post’s opinion section into a state-media apparatus for Trump and his oligarch class. Either way, the pivot is a direct product of the second Trump era and mirrors the president’s own trajectory with the United States government. Become the figurehead of an institution. Try to control it by the old rules. When that doesn’t work, take it by force, break it down, and rebuild it in your image.

Title: Why are CEOs having second thoughts about Trump?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Tariff threats and economic warning signs create corporate uncertainty America's CEOs and billionaires climbed on the Trump bandwagon during the 2024 presidential campaign. A month after the inauguration, some of them are looking to climb off. "CEO optimism is fading" as trade restrictions and mass government layoffs threaten the economy, said Semafor. The stock market has dropped since President Donald Trump took office, while both consumer confidence and consumer spending dropped in January. Trump's on-again-off-again tariff threats have made it impossible for business leaders to make plans. "You can't move a factory overnight," said ON Semiconductor CEO Hassane El-Khoury. That's why American business leaders are "turning on Trump — fast," said Semafor. It took just a month for the new administration to "cool the enthusiasm of chief executives and dealmakers," said The Wall Street Journal. The uncertain environment is making corporate leaders hesitant to pull the trigger on big deals. For that to turn around, "CEOs will need to find more comfort than they have today."

"There's a pretty clear sentiment in America's corporate world these days: anxiety," said Emily Stewart at Business Insider. Trump's reputation as a "loose cannon" may give him an advantage in some negotiations, but businesses find it "challenging to navigate." Businesses are "benefiting from plenty of Trump's actions" — the president halted enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials. But overall, corporate leaders are finding the new administration a "chaotic time," said Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy to Insider. There are "so many surprises that are happening on a weekly basis." "Don't expect corporations to save us from Trump," said Robert Kuttner at The American Prospect. It's only been a few weeks since Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Toyota, Apple's Tim Cook, and OpenAI chief Sam Altman all "donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration." Rebuilding democracy will require the efforts of regular people, not corporations, and the effort "requires containing both Trumpism and predatory capitalism." Not everybody is nervous. One measure of CEO confidence has "soared to its highest level in three years," said Newsweek. The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence "rose significantly" in 2025's first quarter. That's because executives "anticipate business-friendly policies from the new administration, including regulatory and tax changes." Brian Marks, executive director of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program at the University of New Haven, said the reading may be "premature." This early in the new administration is "too soon to fully assess the situation." Others are more downbeat. "There's more uncertainty than I think is widely appreciated," said Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute to The New York Times. The chaos unleashed by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is creating a "chilling effect on investment plans and expansion plans," Strain said. Even the president's allies are cautious. The economy is showing signs of "slower growth and higher inflation," said Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, a business adviser during the first Trump administration. "Not good."

Title: Could tighter budgets lead to more creativity? | Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux interview | The DeanBeat

Founded in 2004, Virtuos has grown into a big company when it comes to the production of games. As an external developer, Virtuos‘ team has crossed 4,200 professional game devs who can supplement the teams at game studios and publishers as they finish their games. The Singapore-based company can finish smaller games with a big shot of staffing at the end or engage in long-term co-development with game publishers as they start the games. Virtuos has a big presence in Asia, and it has worked with nearly all of the top 25 entertainment companies in the world, with either work on video or game content. I’ve caught up with Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux multiple times in recent years — including last February 2024 and in October 2024 — to get access to his bird’s-eye view on the global picture of making games. I saw him briefly at the Dice Summit in Las Vegas and caught up with him in an online conversation this week. Once again, we talked about everything from the state of the game jobs market to the use of AI in making games. His company started in China in 2004 with a studio in Shanghai. It expanded to other cities like Chengdu and Xian. Then it acquired Sparx in 2011 and moved out of China to relocate its headquarters to Singapore in 2018. Langourieux’s company has worked on well over 1,000 projects for the top digital entertainment companies across the world. Recently, the company worked on DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and more. He’s excited to see games coming like Marvel 1943, Judas, Gears of War, Mafia, Doom and more. In our conversation, we touched on how tight budgets could lead to more creativity, the contraction of gaming, the need to be global, the shift to the big game engines like Unreal vs proprietary engines, the need to rejuvenate older IPs, Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. GamesBeat: How was DICE Summit? I saw you there briefly. Gilles Langourieux: I enjoyed it, but I spent too much time in meetings. It’s strange. Usually I spend more time at DICE on the floor and listening. For some reason I had too many meetings this time. Maybe because there’s so much reorganization going on. GamesBeat: It’s the same for me. I had to schedule lots of back to back meetings. I ran out of time to just go find people and say hello. Langourieux: But thanks to you–for example, I read through the transcript of the conversation between Neil Druckmann and his counterpart Cory Barlog at Santa Monica, about creativity. That’s one I would have liked to attend in person. GamesBeat: It was interesting, the mature way they had of looking at the clash between business and creativity. You can create forever and iterate over and over again, but finally, when someone gives you a schedule, that’s when you have to deliver. Langourieux: If you apply that to what’s going on at the more global business level, the same is probably true. With more budget constraints, we might end up with renewed creativity. Just like the deadlines are forcing Neil’s team to come up with the best that they have, tighter budgets might also arrive at a similar result. We’ve made this big move to invest in three development studios in the west. We felt this was necessary on two fronts. First, to demonstrate clearly to the industry that we are game developers. We have full game development capabilities. Second, to make it easier for our teams to engage with clients during pre-production. If you want to do co-dev right, you need to start early. To start early, you need to build trust during pre-production. It’s easier to build trust during pre-production if you have teams in the same culture and the same time zone. What Pipeworks on the west coast, Umanaïa in Montreal, and Abstraction in central Europe bring to us is that proximity in time zones and culture. They’ve been doing co-development for many years. They’re good at embedding themselves with clients early. We bring the ability to scale. They’ve maybe had more limitations there. More than ever, we believe in our model of bringing flexibility to game development studios. We think studios face, with budget constraints–they have to rely on leaner, more agile internal teams. Our part of the industry is to bring that flexibility to them by making it easy. In the past, in our history, we started in China. Our teams were far away, offshore teams, different cultures, different time zones. We’ve been successful with that model, but it was time for us to get closer to our clients, so we can start work earlier and deeper. Then we can get everyone working together when there’s a need to scale up. GamesBeat: There’s an interesting contrast happening. I wouldn’t ask you to comment on them specifically, but Netease seems to be going the opposite direction. They’ve looked at the quality of the triple-A content like Black Myth: Wukong and decided that the teams in China are ready to do a lot of triple-A games. They want to double down on those. The consequence for them is that they just finished investing a lot of money into western studios that they now look at as too expensive. They may not need those people anymore. They might retreat from all of that. Langourieux: They’re a publisher. We’re a development studio specializing in co-development. How we need to be set up is quite different. It’s very important for us to have global teams working with clients in every region. We have business relationships in North America, Europe, and Asia. The easier it is for them to work with us, the better our business. By definition, we have to be global. This has nothing to do with the strategy of this publisher or that publisher. We have to be global. The point we can agree on is that yes, there is great development talent in every region, including China. Black Myth: Wukong has demonstrated that in a stellar way. We’re trying to have studios in every talent pool that matters and take the best of that talent pool and make them work together. What’s unique about the Virtuos setup is that all our studios are good at working together. Depending on the needs of this game or that client, we can find the right talent in the right place and make them work together to create a solution. We call that the “glocalized” approach. It’s global and local at the same time. I don’t think many publishers have that same approach, or need that same approach. GamesBeat: How many studios do you still need to invest in? Is that clear to you yet? Langourieux: Our strategy is not a roll-up strategy. We’re not trying to acquire many studios. What’s important for us is to have one studio in every geography where great games are made. We’re still missing a couple of geographies. We’re trying to complete the puzzle so that we cover all the important geographies where games are made. We cover all the important talent pools and we cover all the important platforms. But once we have a studio like Pipeworks, we don’t plan to add two or three competitors to Pipeworks in the same area. We just plan to help them grow as much as they’re able and willing to grow. Black Shamrock was a studio we acquired in Ireland in 2017. There were 15 people at the time. Today it’s 200 people and one of the biggest in Ireland. We have a track of growing the studios we acquire, not stockpiling more and more studios that end up competing with each other. GamesBeat: How many people do you have altogether now? Still in the 4,000 range or so? Langourieux: We broke 4,000 with these three acquisitions. We’re now at 4,200 across 25 different offices. I want to insist again, these are all studios working on the same platform, so they can all work together and form solutions together to serve the production needs of our clients. GamesBeat: How does some of the outlook break down for you in 2025 and beyond? Langourieux: There’s good and bad. On the plus side, we’re very happy to start the year with the release of DLC 2.2 for Cyberpunk, which illustrates how we can help a client expand their IP while continuing to develop other games. They can satisfy an existing audience while continuing to develop other games by relying on some of our creative teams. We were very excited to see Metal Gear Solid get a release date. That’s going to be a great showcase of our high-end Unreal 5 co-development capabilities. We’re excited to see the Switch 2 get announced. We had a great run on the first Switch with more than 10 titles developed for the platform. We think the next one is going to be very interesting. That’s all the positive. At the same time, the environment is still a bumpy one. We see cancellations. We see the overinvestment bubble of 2021 and 2022 continuing to deflate. We have to keep all our teams on their toes and use our global organization to mitigate these kinds of issues. We continue to see cancellations. GamesBeat: There are still some unhealthy companies among the big ones, or companies that are not quite finished with their unraveling process. Langourieux: On that note, I like to compare it to 2008, when we saw the disappearance of Midway and THQ almost in the same year. That left some unpaid invoices for quite a few developers. I’m not seeing that right now. I’m not saying that won’t happen, but it doesn’t look like any of the major publishers, at least, are going out of business. There’s some reorganization happening for sure. GamesBeat: How are you spread across not just geographies, but capabilities as well? Things like Unreal versus Unity shops and other kinds of specialization across the organization. Langourieux: Five years ago, more than 60% of the work that we were doing was done in proprietary engines. Today I think it’s the other way around. More than 60% of the work we do is done in middleware engines like Unreal and Unity. We do more work on bigger games, and bigger games tend to be made more with Unreal. When you hear Epic claim more than 50% market share, it’s consistent with what we’re seeing on our end. There is a positive element to that. Skill sets transfer more easily than before from one project to another. For example, when we have a large cancellation happening, it’s easier for us to reorganize and have teams work on other projects. Their Unreal skills are useful on other Unreal projects. In the past, when we had a big cancellation on a proprietary engine, if the same client on the same engine didn’t have more work for us, there was a delay in terms of retraining the team to do co-development work in a different pipeline. GamesBeat: I asked Tim Sweeney about this once. One consequence of having a lot of shifts toward Unreal might be that a lot of games start looking the same. He said that might have been true around the Unreal 2 or 3 stage, but now there’s much more customization possible within the engine. Langourieux: I completely agree. In fact, we started something we call the Virtuos Labs, which are small studios purely focused on engineering. One of the larger labs we have now is Abstraction Games. They have 100 people, an engineering studio. Some of the work they do is exactly that. They customize pipelines based on Unreal to make certain kinds of games that have their own specific flavor, their own specific gameplay because of that customization effort. We do see that happening. GamesBeat: Do you see a clear calculation on–if a company changes to a more standard game engine instead of a proprietary one, does that save a certain amount of production costs? Langourieux: What I’ve seen and heard the most is around the ease of finding and training talent. If you have a standard pipeline, it becomes easier to recruit and faster to onboard talent compared to proprietary engines, which create a barrier to inception of talent, and also, in a way, a barrier to inception of co-development partners. One size doesn’t fit all. We’ll continue to need proprietary engines and work with them, because in many instances they allow the creators to get more out of the hardware, to optimize for certain types of gameplay and certain types of rendering. But having one standard makes it easier at the HR level. GamesBeat: Are the macroeconomic factors looking any different today than six months ago? We still have inflation in the United States. We’re not seeing a big growth wave. We still seem to have a slow-growing economy. Langourieux: If I look continent by continent, China and southeast Asia seem to be the most dynamic right now, followed by Korea. Japan is a mixed bag. You have two kinds of actors there. Some are still restructuring. Others are very bullish about making products for the global market to compensate for the slower local market. Europe and North America are both still working through a new approach to game development with safer bets on products made by smaller teams. I read the articles worrying about employment in the west. Once the model has been rebalanced, there’s no reason for employment not to take off again. It may be in a different way, with more reliance on freelancing and external development than before. Leaner internal studios as well. But there’s no reason for growth not to pick up again. There’s an appetite, for example, that we see across the board for rejuvenating IPs. IPs that were left on the sideline because we were only funding huge bets on big games as a service. Now there’s a renewed appetite for looking back on older IPs that could make for smaller, more creative titles. GamesBeat: I’m starting to see more formation of new publishers. That’s different from the trend I saw around many of them closing in the last couple of years. Our job market counter, Amir Satvat, thinks we had an interesting crossover month in January, where there was finally more hiring than firing in the month. On a six-week trailing basis, this is the first time he thinks that’s happened in 30 months or so. Do you see any matching data on your side suggesting that the layoff wave might be balancing out with more hiring? Langourieux: I don’t have data that’s as good as his, but what I see on our end is that we’re able to continue growing our headcount. We’re tapping into different global markets, which are operating at slightly different rhythms. When one market is facing a cancellation, we look to another market to compensate. GamesBeat: What else do you notice about the structure of the external development industry? I’m curious about what it’s like to operate in a market where there’s one company that’s much bigger than you, at least in terms of how many staff they have. Langourieux: It’s exciting. We have teams that have the opportunity to work on fantastic brands. Just think about a few upcoming titles. Marvel 1943, Judas, Gears of War, Mafia, DOOM. There’s so much going on. When you’re operating in a company at our scale, you can focus on the positives and make sure you associate your teams with the most likely winners of tomorrow. There are still a lot of winners. You go to DICE and you meet people. Not everyone is unhappy about cancellations and layoffs. You have a smaller number of companies that are delivering successful titles. They’re happy and positive about the future. We try to focus on helping these companies. Our people get to work on these kinds of promising games. We also try to dodge the bullets. I think that’s a fair way of describing what it’s like to operate at our size. GamesBeat: What is your process for finding those partners and projects like? You get out to a lot of events. Langourieux: I do. It’s an interesting part of my job. We have, I guess, two parallel ways. Our studios have existing relationships with other studios that they maintain. Some of the relationships we have are as old as the company. Some of the initial clients we started working with when we formed the company are still clients today. Our studio leadership maintains these relationships around IPs or brands that we’re familiar with. One example is the Final Fantasy brand. We’ve been working on that nonstop for more than 15 years. Then we have a global team around business development. They speak to studios during events to demonstrate the beauty of co-development done well. There’s a true beauty and comfort when you have co-development partnerships established early on in your production cycles, that are giving you more options and more flexibility as you progress through the development of a game. Our teams are there to demonstrate how we help clients design, develop, and deliver. That third D, delivering, is often the critical piece. Being able to deliver something at quality and on time. That’s the Virtuos way. We have evangelists around what good co-dev looks like. They’re able to explain how important it is to start early, how important it is to have the ability to scale gradually, how important it is to put in place the same systems on both sides that give transparency. Early, scalability, transparency. They show what good looks like for co-dev. That’s how we’re gradually adding more and more clients to our business, through these evangelists. I don’t know if you’ve met Lindsay Gupton, the head of Pipeworks. He’s been doing this for 26 years now. They’re so good at it. I’m lucky to have such a master of co-development join the group and help us show our American clients how it can be done even better today with the addition of Pipeworks. GamesBeat: Are you running into working with multiple co-development companies at the same time? Langourieux: I don’t recommend to our clients that they put all their eggs in one basket. It’s perfectly doable to have multiple co-development studios side by side. I do advocate that they change from the old model of having dozens of siloed smaller studios. It’s difficult to coordinate them, to keep them aligned on the same vision. Very often you have to do the integration and polish yourself in that older model. We recommend going toward a simplified model, where you rely on a smaller number of bigger co-development partners who will handle the coordination, who will handle the integration for you. The model where you’re working with many different smaller external vendors doesn’t scale very well. It leads to a lot of closing issues toward the end of production. GamesBeat: Unity had their problems around price increases. They brought in a new CEO. It seems like they’re in a more stable situation. Things are a bit more predictable. They’re not at war with their customers anymore. I imagine that’s a good thing for companies like yours. Langourieux: All I can say is that even though there was a lot of noise around this, we haven’t noticed a complete change in who is using what engine. It’s difficult to change a pipeline. There may have been a couple of instances where these changes were made, but the state of who is using what hasn’t completely changed as far as we can see. I think it’s good for the industry if they have an organization and pricing structure that makes their clients happier. It’s good that they managed to correct course. GamesBeat: I was going into an interview recently with AWS about cloud game development. What do you think about the state of that right now? Langourieux: It’s very important. Initial efforts are on the way from many different parties. You mentioned Amazon. You can see what Microsoft is doing with their own cloud solution. The players in China are also very active. Alibaba, Tencent, they have a number of cloud initiatives. It was also interesting to hear how Asia is the fastest-growing market for Xbox, because of players experiencing Xbox through the cloud. The devices they use in lower-income countries are less powerful, but that’s compensated for by the fact that they access games through the cloud. That should continue. We’re happy to see these new technologies. We’re looking forward to seeing this new infrastructure combining with AI to lead to new types of games. At GDC we plan to showcase, with Inworld, new types of games that can be created thanks to AI. I expect we’ll be only one of many similar initiatives. It’s required. We aren’t going to grow the industry by simply rejuvenating old IPs or making smaller games. We also need to bring completely new types of gameplay. GamesBeat: Have you seen AI tools arriving yet that are living up to some of the hype? Langourieux: I wouldn’t point to a single tool. I think we should point at a combination of tools that when assembled together, one after the other, allow you to transform a traditional workflow into something that moves twice as fast. The first wave of AI use seems to be more structured this way, rather than a killer app. I haven’t seen fantastic games made through a single prompt yet. Maybe others have. But I have seen entire workflows accelerated. I’ve seen new types of gameplay becoming possible because of the endless possibilities that AI now offers. GamesBeat: We still maybe have a lot of impact ahead of us. Langourieux: I’m convinced of that, absolutely. GamesBeat: Do you expect new consoles on a certain timetable after Nintendo? Are there any particular indications? Langourieux: No, I have no indications. What I’m most excited about is to see how we’re going to tap into the next bucket of potential gamers, people who can’t buy an expensive platform, but are playing through either a lower-end mobile device or lower-end PC. We’re able to access them through a combination of cloud infrastructure and adapting content to suit when they like to play, what they like to play, and what they can afford. If you look at the lower-income economies in Asia, in Africa, in South America, there are still a lot of new players to go after. GamesBeat: Do you see trends like metaverse and blockchain coming or going? Langourieux: Nothing new on that front. It’s still a minority of work for us, not the majority. The move that is continuing is IPs that are strong in one region trying to develop their player base in other regions, or trying to expand to suit new demographics. That’s probably where we see the most movement. Besides the change in model that we already discuss, from bigger studios to smaller studios, bigger titles to leaner titles at launch. GamesBeat: I talked to a consulting firm that was focused on IP generation. They had an interesting point of view around the usual behavior of game studios. They iterated forever on gameplay, with a fresh build every day or every week, and tested that exhaustively. But one of the results of that was that they often thought about the IP behind the game in perhaps the last three months. Things like world-building and character design were more of an afterthought. They spend so much time on gameplay that you don’t get the kind of strong IP that comes out of something like The Last of Us. Langourieux: I grew up with that kind of approach, where you’re looking for a game design and technology breakthrough before you construct the rest of your game around it. I’m not certain that it’s a unique recipe. To paraphrase Neil from his DICE conversation, there is no unique way to arrive at a successful game. Certain teams have this method. Other teams prefer to build a universe first and figure out the game design down the road. We see both. Something that’s more recent in PC and console gaming, though, is what you could call consumer publishing, where you have teams that are focused on creating and aligning a community with a game at the same time the game is being built. Different teams have different ways of doing it, but the common theme there is that you want to have gamers that are strong representatives of the audience associated with your development from early on. Then gradually, as they help you nail down the content of your game, you snowball them into something that’s going to be your community. When the game is ready to go out in the open, they rally the troops, the core gamers, around the game. This approach to making games in co-creation with a community wasn’t mainstream for PC and console five or 10 years ago. It’s becoming more and more frequent, though. GamesBeat: Matthew Ball pointed out that one of the big challenges is that so many people play older games for such a long time now. Call of Duty Warzone stops me from having lots of time to play brand new games. Langourieux: But is today’s Call of Duty Warzone the same as it was a year or two ago? The work that goes into it–it keeps changing. There’s so much new content. I don’t fully understand that argument. Yes, it’s the same name, but there is a lot of work going into adding, adjusting, expanding the content. It becomes a new experience month after month. In return, there is additional revenue coming in from the players in different ways. I don’t think that’s unhealthy at all. I don’t see how it’s different from 20 years ago, when people played a game and then bought the sequel. GamesBeat: The point that Matthew and some others have made is that the window of time for people to try out a brand new IP that they’ve never heard of before is smaller. Live service games consume a lot of their time. They’ll try out a new game, but they won’t do it every month, perhaps. Langourieux: That’s absolutely true. You don’t have that period of time where you’ve finished a boxed product you loved and you’re waiting for the next box to ship. Discovery is more difficult as a result. Stay in the know!

Title: Nvidia’s fine! Besides, who else is going to power all these new AI models?

UPDATED 10:53 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Nvidia came through on earnings this week, with little sign of slowing growth, but investors apparently didn’t like the lower gross margin and knocked shares down more than 8% Thursday. It almost counts as a win given the sky-high expectations. It was a mixed bag for other enterprise tech providers too, as whatever AI-driven boost they’re getting, enterprise customers are not yet spending enough to swing the needle. Snowflake, Workday and Nutanix surged, but not so much Dell, NetApp, HP, Pure Storage and Salesforce (which said its highly touted Agentforce services won’t contribute much to earnings until 2026). As theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and George Gibert have noted, a better data stack needs to arrive before agents can take off. AI uh-oh? Microsoft scrapped some data center leases, though it seems far from a stampede away from AI infra spending just yet, especially with Apple and Alibaba doubling down. Meta, in fact, is looking at spending $200 billion on a single AI data center. Plus, the demanding new AI models keep on coming, this week alone from OpenAI, Tencent, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Anthropic and more. Indeed, IBM is getting busier with AI, buying DataStax and debuting new Granite AI models. On the cloud front, it also just closed its $6.4 billion HashiCorp acquisition. No wonder CEO Arvind Krishna was bullish last month. Amazon finally upped the ante on AI with Alexa+, to pretty good reviews. Dell aims to help telecom providers finally move to the cloud and its shares got a one-day boost as a result. DOGE looks more and more like ransomware, says security expert Bruce Schneier. Except we can’t pay it to stop. Speaking of Elon Musk, how much more obvious does corruption need to be before anyone who can do something about it … does something about it? Quantum computing is drawing more attention from investors as the picks and shovels of Quantum Machines get a $170 million boost. And Amazon also introduced its first quantum chip, or at least the possibility of one. Next week is MWC, where theCUBE will be onsite in Barcelona for interviews and analysis. And there will be earnings from more enterprise bellwethers such as Broadcom, Marvell Semi, HPE, MongoDB, Okta, Box and CrowdStrike. This week’s OMG news (I thought this was a Onion article at first): Gayle King, Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry to lead Blue Origin all-women crewed mission. DEI may be dead on Earth, but I guess it’s OK in space? Here’s all the news from this week, and you can hear more about this and more in John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube: IBM buys DataStax to boost its watsonx data platform for AI applications Microsoft scraps some data center leases as Apple, Alibaba double down on AI Salesforce strikes multibillion-dollar deal to bring its AI agents to Google Cloud MongoDB acquires embedding model provider Voyage AI AI observability startup Arize AI raises $70M Series C round Exclusive: former Snowflake execs raise $5M for agentic AI that simplifies data operations AI-native accounting startup Quanta Financial raises $4.7M to automate bookkeeping in real time Exclusive: ClarityQ raises $3.7M to apply AI to digital product usage analysis WilsonAI raises $1.7M in pre-seed funding for ‘AI paralegal’ OpenAI expands LLM lineup with new general-purpose GPT-4.5 model IBM releases new Granite 3.2 family of models that include reasoning when you want it and some deeper analysis by Dave Vellante: IBM Granite 3.2 Ups the Ante on Open, Efficient, and Trusted Enterprise AI Amazon debuts LLM-powered Alexa+ with expanded automation features Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model can think for as long as you want Microsoft releases new Phi models optimized for multimodal processing, efficiency Tencent releases new AI model it says is faster than DeepSeek-R1 Meta reportedly planning to launch standalone Meta AI app ChatGPT Plus gets a huge deep research upgrade Perplexity AI is building a web browser for ‘agentic search’ Google launches free Gemini Code Assist tier for individuals Cisco expands partnership with Nvidia to drive enterprise AI adoption IDC debuts AI-fueled software procurement analysis service Alibaba makes AI video generation model free to use globally Olas launches decentralized AI marketplace where AI agents can hire each other Couchbase enables more nimble agentic AI development with Nvidia’s NIM Pinecone updates its vector database for “knowledgeable AI apps” CalypsoAI launches cybersecurity leaderboard for AI models StudyFetch’s new conversational AI-powered tutor is a ChatGPT for students Akool unleashes enhancements to its AI human 3D avatars connected to LLMs Strange: Researchers puzzled by AI that praises Nazis after training on insecure code There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Interesting piece by Ben Thompson of Stratechery: AI Promise and Chip Precariousness But his prescriptions ultimately seem unlikely to happen and not all of them, especially re: Intel, seem like a good idea.

Hollywood Life Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News NewsExpand Menu EntertainmentExpand Menu BeautyExpand Menu FashionExpand Menu ShoppingExpand Menu TrendingExpand Menu Celebrity BiosExpand Menu A grassroots group called for a nationwide boycott of shopping at major retail chains. Learn how to participate here. Find Out A new movement is sweeping the nation on February 28, 2025, calling for a mass boycott of shopping at major retailers. The day — known online as “Blackout Friday” or the “economic blackout” — encourages Americans to avoid buying anything nonessential, such as fast food. In order to participate, people can purchase items from local and small businesses. Learn more about the February 28 economic blackout and how to participate below. The nationwide blackout is a movement that Americans can choose to participate in; it’s not a formal holiday nor an order by anyone in the government. Contrary to what critics assumed, the grassroots group known as The People’s Union USA clarified that the blackout is not associated with any political party. According to The People’s Union USA’s website, the group is “dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.” “We are NOT a political party, we are a movement for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, religion, or political affiliation,” the website indicates. “Our goal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) Behind The People’s Union USA is its founder, John Schwarz. According to its site, the group emphasizes that it stands “firmly for equality and freedom for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, background, or identity.” “The idea that companies and institutions should abandon diversity and inclusivity is regressive and unacceptable,” the group notes on its site, referring to the removal of DEI programs by major companies after Donald Trump‘s layoffs of federal DEI workers. “Every American deserves an equal chance at success, and we will not support policies that encourage discrimination or exclusion.” The People’s Union USA also indicates that it is not fighting against “one person,” such as Trump or Elon Musk. “This movement] is about the system as a whole,” the group emphasizes. “Both political parties, both past and current leaders, and billionaires have manipulated the economy and profited off the working class. We will hold them all accountable. Our focus is systemic change, not political drama.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) The February 28, 2025, economic blackout calls for consumers to avoid buying gas, fast food and/or buying anything online or in stores at the biggest retail chains. You can participate in the blackout — which is only the first of several others that The People’s Union USA has planned — by avoiding purchases at major corporations and retailers, such as Target and Amazon. If participants do need to make purchases, though, they are encouraged to only shop at local and small businesses. Items needed for medical purposes or emergencies can still be purchased. The February 28, 2025, economic blackout will end at midnight on March 1, 2025. The next blackout is scheduled to take place on March 28, 2025, and the third is set for April 18, 2025, according to The People’s Union USA. In March, there is a planned week-long blackout against Amazon; there is also one in April against Walmart. Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect

Title: Big Tech wants everyone to use AI, just not when applying for jobs

Happy Friday! What do Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King have in common? They are part of the first all-women space crew since 1963. Sánchez is leading the six-person crew on an 11-minute journey on one of her fiancé Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rockets. In today's big story, Amazon's love affair with AI doesn't extend to job candidates using it during interviews. What's on deck Markets: Goldman Sachs pulls back on DEI language in its annual report. It says it's just following the law. Tech: Internal xAI documents show how workers are instructed to suss out "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in Elon Musk's chatbot. Business: Netflix isn't losing sleep over your canceled subscription. In fact, you'll probably be back. But first, AI for me, but not for interviewees. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tech companies love AI. Just don't try to use it to get a job at one. Amazon created guidelines for its internal recruiters to sniff out job candidates who might be using AI during the hiring process, writes Business Insider's Eugene Kim. The tech giant's stance is that AI tools give candidates an "unfair advantage" that doesn't allow Amazon to evaluate their "authentic" skills, according to guidelines Eugene obtained. As a reminder, this is the same Amazon pouring billions of dollars into AI development in the hopes that AI tools become a key part of people's personal and professional lives. The same Amazon encouraging employees to use its AI chatbot at work. The same Amazon that would love to have its AI-powered Alexa+ in homes across America. With all that AI encouragement, it's not surprising candidates would turn to these tools to give themselves the best chance possible, especially when the market for tech jobs is so tough. Dealing with AI-powered interviewees isn't just an Amazon problem. For about as long as AI chatbots have been around, people have been figuring out how to use them to cheat get an advantage. BI's Rob Price has covered the topic extensively, writing about the "magic teleprompter" apps that feed candidates answers. Sometimes, using AI is just about passing a technical test to get a raise or to land a job. Other times, the tools are shadow stand-ins for people, doing some, if not all, of their actual work. While the latter might sound egregious, using AI tools to get a job that'll require you to use AI tools doesn't seem that out of line. Imagine if you had to try out for a track team but weren't allowed to wear running shoes. Why ban someone from using something they'll eventually need to succeed? I put that question to a tech recruiter. They said the problem is candidates solely relying on AI tools instead of having their own logic and general knowledge. It's a big issue, particularly with younger candidates fresh out of college, they added. Still, it's not like candidates haven't been trying to get an edge on interviews for years. The recruiter mentioned the 2008 book "Cracking the Coding Interview," which includes programming questions commonly asked during interviews. Sometimes, the recruiter has to stay a step ahead, like asking follow-up questions the chatbots might have trouble managing. And if all else fails, maybe AI can help with the AI problem. 1. Meet the fund manager who beats the S&P 500 again and again. Michael Cuggino's Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500, returning 28% versus the index's 17% on a trailing 12-month basis. Cuggino's fund also had a higher average annual gain than the S&P 500 over the past decade. The secret? The fund doesn't invest along themes or focus too much on specific indexes, instead prioritizing quality growth firms. 2. Nvidia still has something to prove. Despite strong earnings, one subject came up a bunch during Nvidia's Wednesday call: gross margins. CFO Colette Kress said expectations are in the "low 70s" for the current quarter as the company ramps up Blackwell chip production. Still, she thinks the gross margins will bounce back after. Even once Nvidia isn't as stressed over speeding up Blackwell, one analyst doesn't think the chip titan will be out of the woods. 3. Goldman wants to play by the rules as it drops DEI references. The bank toned down DEI language in its annual report, mentioning diversity much less than in previous years. The bank also said its "aspirational hiring goals" will expire this year without clarifying if new ones will be implemented. Goldman CEO David Solomon said the bank made the adjustments "to reflect developments in the law in the US." 1. xAI is training Grok in anti-wokeness. BI reviewed internal xAI documents outlining how AI tutors should "spot bias" and look out for "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in its chatbot Grok's responses. Tutors are told to consider the company's "guiding principles," which include "do not moralize, preach, or judge." Some workers said they felt the training methods prioritize right-wing beliefs, while a researcher said he believes Grok's approach can differentiate it from other chatbots. Check out some of the sample prompts and responses tutors were shown. 2. Googlers are using a Google Doc to track Google's layoffs. The tech giant cut jobs across its Cloud, ads, and Trust & Safety teams this week. It follows smaller, surgical cuts across the company over the past few months, employees said. In an effort to track the layoffs, current employees have circulated a crowdsourced Google Doc reviewed by BI. 3. An origin story for Amazon's robots revolutionalizing e-commerce. In 2015, Amazon hosted a competition challenging researchers to build robots that could identify and pick up specific warehouse items. A decade later, those ideas have helped launch a flock of advanced robots that could help the e-commerce giant save as much as $10 billion a year. 1. Rise of the Gen Z realtors. The share of realtors under 30 quadrupled in 2024, data shows, as the profession attracts more young people. Three Gen Z brokers told BI the profession helped them experience financial freedom and avoid slogging away at a typical desk job — even if their baby faces made it hard to get off the ground initially. 2. I just can't quit you, Netflix. The streaming giant isn't worried if you cancel your subscription — data from the analytics company Antenna suggests it'll probably win you back quickly. In 2023, 61% of subscribers who canceled were back on the platform within a year. That win-back rate far surpasses Netflix's streaming rivals' average of 45%. 3. These healthcare startups are ready for acquisitions this year. It's been a slow few years for company combinations in the healthcare startup industry. Nearly a dozen investors and bankers told BI few large companies seem willing to make big deals. The right buyers might be their peers — and seven healthcare startups appear ready to move.

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Sources familiar with the matter stated that Logically, the British fact-checking company, has laid off approximately 8-10 individuals from its India team as part of its company-wide efforts.Â This is part of a larger global restructuring, with dozens of employees laid off as part of cost-cutting measures. Logically Indiaâs spokesperson confirmed the development. In a statement to MediaNama, they stated: âAt Logically, we continuously assess our business to ensure we are best positioned for long-term success in delivering on our mission to combat threats online. With recent new additions to our C-Suite and a transition to being a more product-led business, we have reflected on our company strategy, needs, and organisational structure and made the decision to streamline our operations globally across multiple areas of the business.âÂ The statement added that this decision does not relate to any editorial realignment. âThis decision was not taken lightly, and we are deeply grateful for the contributions of our departing colleagues,â it added.Â The company has operations in the UK, the US, and India and announced layoffs earlier this month, which impacted around 40 employees.Â The fact-checker’s investors include the Amazon Alexa Fund and Vitruvian Partners. The company also secured multi-million-pound government contracts to counter conspiracy theories and false health information online. This follows Metaâs new policy, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in January, which loosened restrictions on political speech and moved away from third-party fact-checking. Specifically, the platform intended to weaken restrictions on sensitive topics like immigration, gender, and gender identity, lift limits on political content, and adopt a community-driven fact-checking system similar to X (formerly Twitter). In India, the crowdsourced âCommunity Notesâ system has also raised concerns among local fact-checkers about their future, despite assurances that international partnerships will remain intact for now.

Title: Google just had layoffs, and Googlers are using a Google Doc to track who got cut

Google this week cut employees across several of its units, including Cloud, ad sales, and Trust & Safety. Google staffers have circulated an internal Google doc tracking company job cuts, crowdsourced from internal memos and employee testimonies. Employees say Google has been making rolling cuts over the past few months, though many were much smaller and more surgical than the large cuts Google made in January 2023. Across the tech industry, companies such as Amazon and Microsoft that conducted sweeping layoffs a few years ago have been making recurring smaller reductions. A Google spokesperson said fewer than 200 roles were affected across the teams mentioned in the document. "Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long-term success," the spokesperson said. "This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead." The crowdsourced document, reviewed by Business Insider, said that several teams were informed of cuts this week, including an unknown number of employees in Google's ad sales team for the Americas Large Customer Sales group, which serves the company's bigger advertising clients. The document cited a memo announcing that the cuts were made to streamline and reduce layers. The document also said that at least 25 people were cut from the Bard EngProd team, an engineering team for the Bard AI product, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. It said an unknown number of employees were cut from the Trust & Safety group, citing a memo describing some jobs as being "redeployed." A spokesperson said the company intended to grow the Trust & Safety team despite the latest eliminations. For most teams, the specific number of employees cut is unknown. Several teams within Google's Cloud unit also had job cuts this week, including the Threat Intelligence Group, Scaled Customer Engineering, Google Cloud Platform Support, Go-To-Market, and Looker groups, the document said. Bloomberg earlier reported some details of the Cloud layoffs. Within Google, employees have often crowdsourced documents to share information such as which teams got hit with job cuts or how much money employees of different levels and locations make. Employees at other tech companies, such as Amazon, have circulated similar crowdsourced documents to share information about job cuts. Last month, Google offered voluntary buyouts for staff in its Pixel hardware and Android division, BI previously reported. Have a tip?

Title: A new public policy agenda has a vision for “local news for the people”
URL: https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/02/a-new-public-policy-agenda-has-a-vision-for-local-news-for-the-people/
Time Published: 2025-02-27T14:42:15Z
Full Content:
What would a local media system that prioritizes working and middle classes over corporate profits and the interests of billionaires look like? A new public policy agenda released this week has some ideas. The Media Power Collaborative, which released its policy framework on Tuesday, describes itself as an organizing space for media workers and their allies in research, activism, and education. The collaborative grew out of a peer networking group — now known as the News Futures collective — and is part of the media reform group Free Press. If you remember the much-discussed Roadmap for Local News that argued that the future of local news is “civic information,” this is the same crowd. The local news industry, as Nieman Lab readers well know, has been devastated by ad revenue losses, layoffs, and profit-driven corporate ownership over the past couple of decades. Over that time, local newspapers have shrunk faster than a new crop of local news sites and nonprofit newsrooms have been able to grow. Through the policy agenda, policy tracker, and a new network of regional coalitions, the Media Power Collaborative wants to push the public policy conversation toward support for some of the more community-minded local media that’s emerged to fill that gap. RELATED ARTICLEThe future of local news is “civic information,” not “declining legacy systems,” says new reportLaura Hazard OwenFebruary 2, 2023There’s a lot of overlap between the Media Power Collaborative and organizations like Rebuild Local News, which has its own policy menu and legislation tracker, and other media industry groups. But unlike, say, the News Media Alliance — which replaced the Newspaper Association of America and primarily represents commercial news publishers — the Media Power Collaborative and its aligned groups are orientated around meeting local information needs. In some communities, that could mean supporting a local nonprofit newsroom or an independent civic-minded daily newspaper. In others, it might mean supporting someone who might not even call themselves a journalist but regularly covers school board meetings or local immigration raids. The Media Power Collaborative is more likely, in other words, to focus on local media ownership, civic information hubs, and public schools or libraries than returning legacy newspapers to 2005 staffing levels. Free Press often hears from local journalists and organizers who’ve been asked to support a specific bill or initiative being considered in their state or city. Mike Rispoli, senior director of journalism and civic information at Free Press, said local practitioners often want to engage in policy issues, but aren’t always confident in their ability to determine if their newsroom or civic media initiative stands to benefit. Rispoli also described the Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda as an attempt at longer-term thinking. “While I think things like tax credits can be important, we also know that’s a bridge proposal at best. I think what the MPC policy agenda is [asking] is, ‘What should we be building a bridge to? What is the actual thing that we want?'” Rispoli explained. “The end goal of these policies should be more informed communities, more engaged communities, and — as a byproduct of that — supporting news and its production.” The Media Power Collaborative agenda highlights local news and information as a public good that deserves “robust public funding” whether it comes from a legacy newsroom or not. From the report: Just like safe roads and strong public-education systems, public-service journalism and civic information are public goods that benefit entire communities. Unfortunately, the market is critically underproducing these public goods: Estimates of what it would cost annually to bridge current community-information gaps range from $1 billion to $10 billion or more. Even with promising new philanthropic investments in local news and civic media, public funding is essential to addressing a deficit of this magnitude and building toward a community-centered local-news system. The agenda also reflects a widespread frustration with public policy proposals that would benefit legacy newspaper chain owners such as Alden Global Capital. This has been a consistent theme for civic information advocates though by no means limited to them. “Corporate media and hedge funds and broadcasters — these are folks who have the ears of lawmakers. They have resources to lobby. And so every starting place in the conversations about media policy is something that protects their interests,” Rispoli said. “A bit of it is saying this [civic media] part of the field deserves a seat at the table. But a bit of it is saying we should be the ones setting the table.” RELATED ARTICLEThe scale of local news destruction in Gannett’s markets is astonishingJoshua BentonMarch 9, 2023Some of these corporate owners have gutted local newsrooms, Rispoli noted, and yet they’re “the ones at the front of the line with their hand out, saying, ‘we should be getting money from the government.'” The agenda attempts to address some of the biggest questions in local news policy, including how to protect editorial independence; which local news orgs should qualify for assistance; and, given finite public funding, which communities should be prioritized. Limiting public funds to legacy news organizations does not address their history of underserving communities of color as well as rural and low-income groups. It seems more likely to reinforce existing news deserts and information gaps. Candice Fortman, a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford and former executive director of Outlier Media, was one of the 10 members that met over the course of 2024 to craft the public policy agenda. “Many minds are working to build the agenda for the future of local news and how we will protect and fund reporting,” Fortman said. “This initiative, however, is about more than just saving local news; it’s about rebuilding it in a way that is equitable, sustainable, and deeply rooted in community needs.” The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda calls for “a transformed media system” that is “backed by robust public funding with sturdy firewalls in place to preserve editorial independence.” Some of the specific proposals include: The full agenda is here. No one is saying any of this will be easy. Those estimates for closing the local news gap are enormous and it’s unlikely public funding alone is the answer. There are also important and fair questions about editorial independence and giving anyone — never mind the government — the power to decide which journalists and news organizations will receive taxpayer dollars. Perhaps more pressingly, though, is that although majorities of both Democrats and Republicans approve of local media, the political polarization and harsh rhetoric at the national level has trickled down to state and local policy conversations. Funding for public media — already lower in the U.S. than in many other democracies — is under threat. Even paid news subscriptions for government workers have been criticized and exploited for political purposes in recent weeks. Federal legislation seems off the table for now, and we’ll have to see how many states and cities will see proposals to support local news become law. I noted one other ominous sign. The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda mentions that research tells us low-income communities, communities of color, immigrant communities, and rural communities are the most underserved by our current local media system. The report includes a link to research published by the FCC. The report, which was live in late December, now shows a “page not found” error message.

Title: Musk, DOGE, and the AI-fueled Plot to Fire Everybody

What is DOGE? Officially, it’s the “Department of Government Efficiency,” intended to find and eliminate government fraud and waste; officially, it’s also a joke, named after an old meme. DOGE doesn’t just emit mixed signals — the incoherent messaging is right there in the name. It’s part of the plan and, for supporters, part of the fun. When necessary, the government argues that what DOGE is doing is just common sense, that Elon Musk is spearheading a “comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,” and that the administration has a “commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce.” Nearly as often, though, the mask slips or gets pulled off and thrown on the ground: This isn’t true, not that we’re engaged in any meaningful sort of collective debate over facts here: According to polling, a majority of Americans think that Musk has too much power in government and share a negative view of DOGE. It’s not pure MAGA polarization, either — the public views Musk less favorably than it views President Trump. You may grant, if you insist, a genuine desire to find and eliminate inefficiencies in the federal government, but Musk and his supporters are barely trying to hide other animating impulses here. The immense contempt they have for federal workers; the immense contempt they feel for the courts or anyone else who might slow their efforts to fire said federal workers; the zealous energy they bring to cutting as many people as possible; and the willingness to make things up, or to refuse to correct falsehoods, in pursuit of a nakedly ideological project and of power more generally. Musk, who is arguably the second-most-powerful person in government, and the most successful capitalist in America, officially has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” according to White House lawyers, but his constant (and constantly heeded) posts betray both his functional position and the minimum bound of his ambitions. Specifically, he wants to fire as many people as possible. Punishing workers is a cause and a purpose unto itself, inseparable from a grandiose conflation of personal desires and successes with the fate of humanity. It’s an ecstatic project with an accelerationist character. “I am become meme,” he declares, as his team of private-sector loyalists harasses federal employees with spiteful emails threatening to get rid of them. The message from the largest employer in the country to its disfavored employees could not be much clearer: You are waste, you are fraud. We want to make a spectacle of your misfortune. We cannot wait to fire you. DOGE is certainly helping to achieve — to quote the words of Project 2025 author and new director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought — the goal of putting federal workers “in trauma” and casting them as “the villains.” But Musk is more than a willing mercenary for someone else’s project, and his stature and influence within and outside the government imbues his slash-and-burn campaign with greater significance. Within the scope of DOGE, Musk is playing the role of government auditor and contractor, which is conflict enough. But he’s also a singular industrialist with multiple companies devoted to automation, a history of executing brutal and punitive firings, and a proudly hostile stance toward organized labor and regulation. Most relevant, however, is his longtime obsession with what he sees as the mother of all technologies. He’s an AI guy. This might explain why DOGE’s flamboyant and unprecedented performance feels both familiar and unsettling beyond the government workforce. We’re committing all of our time and resources to eliminating your job, and by the way, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. We’re chasing inconceivable power, and you might end up as collateral damage. We’re making a new world, and this is our only chance to get it right. We’re trying to fire you. This is how MAGA Republicans talk about the political moment. It’s also how America’s premier industry sounds when it’s talking about AI. Most other tech executives aren’t openly fantasizing about detaching employee “parasites” from their hosts, but some get closer than others. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg recently announced layoffs explicitly targeting “low performers,” which many at the company saw as a pointed and unnecessarily damaging way to cut costs, adding insult to injury and damaging prospects for former employees. The layoffs came in the context of a larger attempt at an ideological pivot for the company, marked by Zuckerberg’s interview with Joe Rogan (and following Musk’s mass-layoff trial run at Twitter, about which Zuckerberg, and other corporate leaders, had publicly expressed envy). They also came in the context of the company’s massive planned investment in AI, which Zuckerberg talked about on the show. “Probably, in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” he told Rogan. (He softened the implication by suggesting that AI would simply free people up to work on more interesting problems, but the comments reverberated, as intended, through the tech industry.) More commonly, AI executives talk about work and labor in general. In a recent blog post, OpenAI founder Sam Altman made his case for mass automation. “Imagine AI as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual co-worker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work,” he wrote. He suggested, with an optimistic gloss, that “huge” changes are coming: “We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today.” In AI, we’re getting some mixed messages too — the people working on this stuff are excited but worried. Founders and CEOs talk about glorious abundance with the public and tease concentrated returns to investors. They muse about automation and the future of work, raise alarms, fund alignment research, and talk about existential risk. Altman, for his part, has commissioned research into the plausibility and effects of UBI for a post-AI world. A bit like DOGE, however, OpenAI’s conflicted identity is embodied in its name and concept. The company was a nonprofit with the mission to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” By 2019, it was teaming up with Microsoft to raise tens of billions of dollars. Now, it’s in the process of converting into a for-profit company. Just as DOGE is pursuing something more than simple increases in efficiency, AI firms are pitching something more than simple increases in productivity. The gap between the industry’s coy, delicate rhetoric around automation in some contexts — oh, maybe we’ll need UBI, ha-ha, er, well, it’ll be a lot of change very fast, but it’ll work out maybe, eh, maybe regulate us? — and its far less conflicted pitch to investors is not lost on people whose jobs might be defined as “knowledge work,” nor is its fervor as expressed in sheer dollar amounts. “Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft intend to spend as much as $320 billion combined on AI technologies and data-center build-outs in 2025,” reports CNBC, a level of investment for which observers have struggled to find comparison (although here’s one from The Information: “Big Tech’s Capex Gusher Tops Last Oil Spree,” a.k.a. the shale boom). Many of the largest and most visible companies in the economy, in other words, are working toward the same goal, collectively marshaling a level of resources otherwise associated with national infrastructure projects or wars. You can characterize their goals and corresponding long-term outcomes in a wide range of ways, but if you live anywhere downstream from their project, the message, again, is pretty clear, albeit with a few more apologies and caveats appended as necessary, delivered with polite contrition rather than foaming zeal: We’re sorry, but we have no choice but to do everything in our power to replace you with machines. New polling from Pew suggests that this message is being heard, and the Zuckerbergian appeals to the history of automation — that maybe it will create more, better jobs in the long term, after periods of transitional pain — aren’t resonating. According to a Pew survey of American workers, 52 percent are “worried about the future impact of AI use in the workplace,” while 32 percent “think it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run.” Though 36 percent “feel hopeful” about how AI might be used at work, 33 percent are “overwhelmed,” while just 6 percent believe it will lead to more job opportunities in the long run. The parallels between DOGE’s all-or-nothing bet that it can purge the federal government and the AI industry’s promise to purge humans from wide swaths of the existing private workforce are united in the figure of Musk, a former partner in OpenAI who now runs his own AI firms; to him, the projects are clearly connected, synergistic, and mutually necessary. He’s making this fairly explicit! DOGE is claiming, with few details, to use AI to further its missions, however you might interpret them: AI to replace government work; AI to arbitrarily fire people with a sheen of analysis; “AI” wielded as a broader demoralizing force or conveniently summoned threat to workers. There are intentional and unintentional aspects of his leadership at DOGE that, if nothing else, clarify the beliefs he’s enacting and seem to hold. Perhaps most of the government shouldn’t exist, and someone like Musk should run what’s left of it. Perhaps most jobs shouldn’t exist, or at least inevitably won’t, so why wait around? Perhaps employees who wish to have jobs should be reminded to do as they’re told. It can be hard to call a moment or define an era without the benefit of hindsight, and tipping points tend to reveal themselves in retrospect. As top-down attempts to impose and manifest a different world go, though, this is almost parodically blunt stuff. The president is a guy who rose to national fame firing people from fake jobs on a TV show. His publicly unhinged billionaire quasi-co-president is a man who appears to believe that most government jobs are fake, and who has been deputized to eliminate as many of them as possible. Like many of his peers in private industry, this same guy talks in urgent and increasingly dire terms about winning the race to build human-level and maybe superhuman AI, a project into which the tech giants are sinking the hundreds of billions of dollars in cash they’ve harvested from their users over the last decade. Whatever you think of its chances of succeeding, and whatever you think would come out of the other side in the long term, their fundraising resembles a bet on, at minimum, short-to-medium-term mass displacement in segments of the economy that were until recently understood as relatively safe. In fuller expression, it’s not just a post-worker vision, it verges on post-human. To anyone who isn’t invested in these outcomes, either literally or ideologically, it’s an unsettling wager. In Trump, Musk, and Silicon Valley’s speculative CEOs — whose musings and strategies are certainly being heard and nervously interpreted by leaders across various potentially disruptable industries — America is living under a nightmare boss trifecta, each potentially familiar to different workers in their own way. There’s the one who wants to fire you for disloyalty, the one who wants to fire you because he thinks you’re undeserving and less than, and the one who grimaces through the PIPs and the RIFs but lights up during the earnings calls. The news can, at times, resemble a Zoom call from hell, with Americans on mute as management talks through plans for getting rid of them. It’s layoff morning in America. These parallels also extend into an unknown future. It’s increasingly clear that Musk and Trump have ambitions for DOGE that extend beyond cuts and into meta-governmental control. It represents, in other words, an all-or-nothing bet on remaking, destroying, or perhaps controlling the government, with a massive potential upside for those involved and correspondingly large risk if they fail. Big tech’s push into AI is similarly high stakes, with firms both excited about possible returns but also fearful of getting stuck on the wrong side of a massive reallocation of power. A superpower freed of its opposition and a superintelligence freed of its labor force are versions of the same fantasy in which absolute power is seized, or obtained, through different means. These expressions of absolute self-belief shouldn’t be confused with inevitability, of course, nor, should they come up short of counterrevolution and post-human superintelligence, respectively, will their almost unbelievable nakedness be forgotten. (A pressing question about both is whether they’re accelerating toward a lasting new status quo, ramping like a manic episode, or a little bit of each. Either way, they have the potential to be widely galvanizing.) Given overlapping once-in-a-generation opportunities, America’s most empowered and resentful bosses have converged on the same simple plan: laying everyone off.

Choose your location By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Steve Bannon, former adviser to President Donald Trump, has cautioned the Trump administration against implementing cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that a significant portion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) base relies on this program.

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s billionaire buddy turned commerce secretary, has confirmed that the administration was simply lying to MAGA supporters about not touching Social Security and Medicare. “Back in October … I flew down to Texas, got Elon Musk to [set up DOGE], and here was our agreement: that Elon was gonna cut a trillion dollars of waste fraud and abuse,” Lutnick told Jesse Waters of Fox News Wednesday night. “We have almost $4 trillion of entitlements, and no one’s ever looked at it before.

That puts Trump on track to deport about 450,000 undocumented immigrations per year—or about 1.8 million over the course of his term—despite the president and his “border czar” Tom Homan promising 10 million to 12 million deportations.

Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it’s done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Although Salesforce swabbed mention of its diversity targets in its 2023 10-K filing, it still released a 2024 “equality update.” In that update, the company reiterated its commitment to diverse representation and how much more it still needs to achieve. In a conversation with Axios recently, CEO Marc Benioff said he would stand by his employees amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI orders. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Mountain View By Adam Nichols, Amid Elon Musk’s whirlwind campaign to cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in government services in the name of efficiency, a bombshell report Wednesday revealed a staggering amount of taxpayer cash that goes directly to him. The richest man in the world is one of the biggest earners paid from public money, the Washington Post found . A deep dive into government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits found the South African billionaire has reaped $38 billion dollars of government cash. Want more breaking political news? Click for the latest headlines at Raw Story. The Post reported the payments started more than 20 years ago, as Musk secured a low-interest loan from the Energy Department as CEO of the then-struggling Tesla. That department is one of many now hit by mass layoffs and cuts led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The Post spoke to unnamed sources from inside the government to back up its story. Almost two-thirds of the cash came in the past five years, according to the report. Just last year, at least $6.3 billion was committed to Musk’s companies. They included cash to build a Tesla factory and NASA contracts to his company SpaceX to aid the moon program. ALSO READ: Elon Musk's DOGE boys think this is a video game as Trump plots his 2nd coup “The total amount is probably larger: This analysis includes only publicly available contracts , omitting classified defense and intelligence work for the federal government,” the Post reported. It went on, “The Post found nearly a dozen other local grants, reimbursements and tax credits where the specific amount of money is not public.” The report also found 52 contracts with seven government agencies that are set to pay another $111.8 billion over the next few years. All seven agencies have come under DOGE's microscope. While Musk is not a paid government employee, he was a massive funder of now-President Donald Trump’s election campaign and is now a central part of his advisory team. He also heads DOGE, which he claims will slash trillions of dollars in government waste. Musks’s part in the Trump administration has raised many red flags among onlookers about major conflicts of interest. “Not every entrepreneur at this scale has been this dependent on federal money — certainly not Nvidia, not Microsoft, nor Amazon, nor Meta,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — who unofficially leads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — may be playing video games at work, according to a new report. Gaming publication Kotaku reported Friday that the South African centibillionaire who recently ordered federal employees to send him an email justifying their jobs now has a sleek gaming computer in his DOGE office. Musk was previously working out of the West Wing of the White House, but the New York Times reported that he called it a "hovel" and relocated his office to the Secretary of War Suite at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The Obama White House archives describes the Secretary of War Suite as "ten rooms designed by Stephen Decatur Hatch, a prominent New York architect of the late 19th-century" that was "occupied by 18 Secretaries of War until July 1939." While President Donald Trump has given his blessing to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's effort to slash federal budgets and fire federal workers, the South African centibillionaire's initiative is now reportedly clashing with a key Trump administration policy. Politico reported Friday that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE... A new report from Rolling Stone claims that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is taking a wrecking ball to the Social Security Administration, which could seriously hurt beneficiaries' ability to collect the money they are owed. According to the report, DOGE has already "shuttered at least 10 Social Security field offices in as many states" and "has eliminated the SSA’s Office of Transformation, a department whose work included making it easier for Americans to apply for and access benefits online — the exact service many people will need now that offices are being closed across ... A senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development was placed on leave this weekend after releasing a letter in which he states that the number of deaths from Donald Trump's policies is "not known." The career official, Nick Enrich, outlined what he called the U.S. government’s “failure” to provide life-saving aid around the world because of Trump's political appointees, according to a Sunday report from the Washington Post.

Steve Bannon, former adviser to President Donald Trump, has cautioned the Trump administration against implementing cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that a significant portion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) base relies on this program. In a recent episode of his "War Room" podcast, Bannon stated, "Get into Medicaid. Medicaid, you got to be here because a lot of MAGAs on Medicaid.

The Trump administration has indicated it may target the food stamp program, also known as SNAP, for deep budget cuts. It also may strengthen the work requirement for SNAP. Many SNAP recipients are already required to work, especially those who are able bodied and under the age of 54. “If you are age 16 to 54 and able to work, you will probably need to meet the general work requirements to get SNAP benefits,” according to the SNAP website. “The general work requirements include registering for work, participating in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by your state SNAP agency, taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing your work hours below 30 a week without a good reason.” Addressing comments made by billionaire Elon Musk about his staffers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), MSNBC host Michael Steele bluntly stated, "He's full of crap."

Mountain View By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Steve Bannon, former adviser to President Donald Trump, has cautioned the Trump administration against implementing cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing that a significant portion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) base relies on this program. In a recent episode of his "War Room" podcast, Bannon stated, "Get into Medicaid. Medicaid, you got to be here because a lot of MAGAs on Medicaid.

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s billionaire buddy turned commerce secretary, has confirmed that the administration was simply lying to MAGA supporters about not touching Social Security and Medicare. “Back in October … I flew down to Texas, got Elon Musk to [set up DOGE], and here was our agreement: that Elon was gonna cut a trillion dollars of waste fraud and abuse,” Lutnick told Jesse Waters of Fox News Wednesday night. “We have almost $4 trillion of entitlements, and no one’s ever looked at it before.

Melly Barajas is known as the “queen of tequila.” The 60-year-old founder and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico was an aspiring fashion designer when her father planted the idea of owning a tequila brand in her head. As she started learning everything she could about making tequila, she was often the only woman in the room. In the 25 years since Leyenda’s founding as one of the first female-owned tequila companies, it has expanded to produce 20,000 liters of tequila daily. Barajas, who was recently named to the Forbes 50 Over 50: Global list, runs an all-female operation. “I really think this industry needed the female touch,” she told Forbes’ Maria Gracia Santillana Linares. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The House approved a budget resolution Tuesday that lays the framework for President Donald Trump's agenda, the first major test of the new Congress. The plan calls for $2 trillion in overall spending cuts over the next decade, extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosts defense spending. Trump told reporters Tuesday his administration plans to sell a “gold card” for $5 million that will provide wealthy non-citizens U.S. residency and a route to citizenship, an announcement that comes as he spearheads a mass deportation initiative. He said the card will give buyers the same privileges as green card holders, who have permanent residency and work authorizations in the U.S. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Tesla’s share price fell more than 8% Tuesday following reports that the company’s sales across Europe dropped by about 45% over the last month—despite rival electric-vehicle companies seeing increased demand. The losses caused CEO Elon Musk’s net worth to plummet by almost $15 billion, as his role in the Trump Administration weighs on shares, according to one analyst. Investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s Wednesday’s earnings report, which will provide early indications of how it will emerge following the release of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China. Ahead of the report, the AI giant’s stock fell 2.8% Tuesday, amid a broader pullback of tech stocks. At least 21 former staffers of the U.S. Digital Service, which was renamed the Department of Government Efficiency in a takeover by President Donald Trump, resigned Tuesday. The anonymous staffers wrote in a letter that they would not “use our skills as technologists” to “compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” Donald Trump Jr. made $813,000 in 2024 as a director of Trump Media & Technology Group—roughly a quarter of the company’s annual revenue—despite attending just two of the board’s five meetings, according to an SEC filing. Trump Jr. controls 52% of the outstanding shares of the parent company of Truth Social, as the sole trustee of his father’s revocable trust. AFP/Getty Images Ukraine reportedly agreed Tuesday to partner with the U.S. on a mineral development deal, possibly mending a contentious relationship between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Trump seeks a ceasefire with Russia. The deal involves Ukraine and the U.S. jointly developing Ukrainian minerals, oil and gas, according to Bloomberg, which noted the agreement does not include security guarantees for Ukraine. A growing coalition of Republicans are starting to speak out against DOGE and its mass layoffs across the federal workforce, including Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, and Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick. Several Republicans have been confronted by constituents about DOGE at recent town halls, though President Donald Trump has insisted Americans “like the job that Elon is doing.” MORE: White House officials confirmed that Amy Gleason, a longtime healthcare technology executive, is now the acting administrator of DOGE, following weeks of speculation over whether Elon Musk was officially in charge. Gleason previously worked in the U.S. Digital Service during Trump’s first term. BondIt cofounders Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor TOPLINE For decades, taking big swings on ambitious independent film projects has been a seductive and highly risky investment strategy in Hollywood. Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony will celebrate the best of these success stories, but each year there are many more fortunes lost than trophies won. BondIt has differentiated itself since its founding in 2013 by lowering the risk, attracting institutional money and providing more dependable returns with its low stakes, high volume approach on movies that will never score millions at the box office or contend for Oscars. The company does have one nomination, but the vast majority of the 500-plus films BondIt has financed are the types of low-budget genre flicks that skip theatres and go straight to streaming services and TV networks across the world. The company builds its loans against predictable, projectable returns, such as the money a production receives back in tax credits for filming in a certain state or country, or its pre-sales in international markets. Other factors are less black-and-white, like a filmmakers’ ability to deliver a movie on time, the quality of the project’s sales team and how much equity capital has already been raised. BondIt movies might be less glamorous, but they deliver consistent returns. In any given 12-month window, BondIt invests in 50 or more films and turns over more than $100 million in capital—a metric the company measures as its revenue—writing off less than 1% in bad loans and delivering 15-20% returns. WHY IT MATTERS “In a time where movie studios and streamers are contracting and looking to cut costs, it would seem like there's a place in the entertainment industry for more independents to break through,” says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. “The only problem—independent movies are historically a very risky business. If BondIt can prove otherwise, it may be able to attract big institutional money to the space, and fund the kinds of movies that the studios no longer make.” MORE Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television Starbucks has had its ups and downs, but lately, it’s been mostly downs, as the company reported basically flat 2024 revenues and announced 1,100 corporate job cuts Monday. The company’s brand reputation is also declining, data shows: 4%: Starbucks’ decline in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2025 No. 45: The coffee chain’s ranking in a recent Brand Finance report of the most valuable global brands, plunging from No. 15 in 2024 57.7: The number of points Starbucks’ reputation had on a 100-point index, declining from 71.5 points in 2021, according to Reptrak If you’re networking but still not landing job offers, that could be because you’re not meeting with the right people. While it’s important to network with employees at all levels, be sure to focus on the gatekeepers who influence or make hiring decisions. Smart networking is also a numbers game: Companies aren’t always hiring, so try to keep in touch with hiring managers and you’ll be top of mind when an opportunity opens up. A consumer activist group is launching a grassroots campaign to boycott online and in-store spending Friday in an attempt to “take back control of our economy, government and future of our country.” It’s also planning specific protests against which of the following retailers? A. Nestlé B. Amazon C. Walmart D. All of the above Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

Wednesday, 26 Feb 2025 A demonstrator holds a poster displaying a prohibited traffic sign reading 'Musk DOGE' during a rally to protest President Trump's policies on Presidents Day on Feb 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. — AP WASHINGTON: More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Feb 25 from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk – not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernise Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardise Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,“ they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimise DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer – an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,“ Kamens said. US Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalised. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the US Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. – AP Thank you for your report!
