Longtime entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash on where the tech industry has been and where it may be going 2:00 PM PST on January 14, 2026 Tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash. Photo: Anil Dash Advertisement opens in a new tab. These are tough times for tech workers. Half-a-million tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as their companies continued to invest, insatiably, in AI and deploy products that have caused psychosis in their own investors, seamlessly produced and proliferated child sex abuse material, and encouraged teenagers to kill themselves. So-called “hard tech” is in: Jobs in defense and surveillance are the hottest roles on the market. Working 9-9-6 (that’s 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) is the new answer to work-life balance. And for anyone still holding onto the progressive, pro-immigrant, “democratizing” dreams of the tech industry of the 2010s, Big Tech leaders (and some of their partners, including a distracting Lauren Sánchez) made their new political alignment clear as day just under a year ago, when they joined Donald Trump at his second inauguration. Anil Dash is not surprised by the dark turn the industry has taken. As a seasoned entrepreneur, prolific early blogger, and proponent for civil liberties in the digital world (he sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), Dash has kept a close eye on tech leaders and chronicled the impacts on the workforce in his blog, including a recent post with the howling headline How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?. To usher our tech-minded (and anti-tech-minded) readers into 2026, Gazetteer SF got Dash on the phone for a chat about AI, labor, why the MAGA ethos has taken hold of the industry, and a grand VC conspiracy. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You said this moment in tech is “grim” and “about as bad as you’ve seen.” What are the forces that have brought us to this moment? A great one, that is going somewhat underreported, is just the numbers. ChatGPT came out in late 2022, a little over three years ago, and since then there have been over half-a-million layoffs across the tech sector. Just that one signal — put all the other things aside — that’s decimation. That’s twice as much as the DOGE guys cut in the federal government. This would be devastating if it was the auto industry. It’s ten times as many people as work in the entirety of coal mining. It’s shocking to think about that many jobs gone. This industry’s been gutted. In any normal time, people would say, “Oh, this is a recession.” But because those same companies [who are doing layoffs] are doing this financial sleight-of-hand where they’re doing deals with each other — like, “We’ll buy machines from you and you buy AI from us,” — they make it look like the share prices are going up, so it doesn’t look like a recession. That’s part one. Part two is what we’re seeing at the top, which trickles down to tech workers and creates this really grim outlook. What I mean is we’re seeing this new technique of the leaders of these companies — the investors, owners, CEOs — are now able to make money even if the companies never make money. That’s new. It started a little over ten years ago, and I’ll give you Uber as an example. Before they went public, Uber had only ever lost money. Billions and billions of dollars. And yet, their investors were still able to make billions of billions of dollars in profit by making this thing public and recouping that money on IPO day. That is different than everything else in the prior history of the industry. What they figured out was if you tell a great story, and, importantly, if you get a legal monopoly, which Uber and Lyft basically did, you can print money kind of without regard to whether it ever makes sense as a business or not. So that’s been a pattern with everything that’s followed, whether it’s crypto or AI. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that's not venture capital. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that’s not venture capital. If you wouldn’t call this venture capitalism, what would you call it? It’s pure crony capitalism. Corruption capitalism. These days, when you go to raise, the VCs are explicit about how they’re all talking to each other about what your business is, what your economics are, what they think of your company, what they each think they might offer you. That is collusion. They’re not competitors. It is essentially one company with different divisions, openly sharing information against entrepreneurs. If you get to even a Series B, you will have to take money from either Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund or Ron Conway, and it’s straight-up Godfather shit. They’ll say, “You’re gonna need help some day, and we can help you. We know PR. If you get stuck, we know someone in the White House.” Let’s talk about the tech and White House. When we think of the tech industry of the 2010s, we think of progressive, optimistic ideals. Now, we’re seeing the hard tech era and tech leaders cutting DEI and supporting Trump. For those of us who weren’t there, was the tech industry of the 2010s just marketed differently, or did it really operate differently? For workers, it was genuinely really different. It was peak Obama optimism era, and it was 100 percent sincere. The creature comforts were really good, the benefits were great, the holiday parties were huge. And structurally, tech companies were genuinely providing upward mobility for people. They were genuine advocates for H-1B visas. People now are at this point where they're so beaten down they're kind of like, “Was it all a lie?” But I had enough visibility and access, like I’ve had dinner with Jeff Bezos, I’ve been in the room, and I can say they were different. They have changed, and been changed by intentional political actors like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. And now they’ve pickled each others’ brains. Do you think today’s founders have to move in this more libertarian direction to survive in this industry? They don’t even have to move. I talk to young founders these days and for them, there’s no other world than the Trump world. I ask them what inspired them to go into tech and they say they read Marc Andreessen’s manifesto, they read Peter Thiel’s books, and I think, “Oh, your brain’s cooked.” They come in pre-pickled. But everyone else who could have told an alternate narrative has been hounded out of the industry. In terms of the libertarian bent, those intentional political actors like Peter Thiel were very intentional about it. They created their own media ecosystem. They created Substack — they, meaning Andreessen Horowitz is a big investor — and paid to have content on there that would drive users to their own media. They took over culture. On the topic of VC media ecosystems, I saw the Thread you posted a few days ago about common things VCs believe. One was “Platforms need Nazis on them.” What do you mean by that? Well, it’s inciting. These guys like Thiel and [White House AI czar David] Sacks have been fixated for 30 years on trying to normalize and re-assert the public use of slurs. One of the examples they use [in their 1998 polemic The Diversity Myth] is the r-slur, which had just fallen out of favor in the early ‘90s. And they were explicitly saying not being able to use these slurs reflects growing political power from these groups, and that's why we need to bring them back. I have these notes that I’ve written, and I need to wait until I can like spend my entire waking hours defending the onslaught of shit I’ll get for writing it, but I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. That is dark. I can’t even contain my reaction to that. That is scary. I want to be wrong. But, yeah, they want to make sure [marginalized groups] don’t have power, and that’s signified by having Nazis on a platform. On that note of power, with all the layoffs and the bleakness among the workforce, do you think we’re going to see any sort of labor power movement in the tech industry? I’m hopeful. There was a moment in 2018, 2019, 2020, early COVID, when I thought there was going to be a moment. That’s when you had Amazon workers unionize in Staten Island [in 2022] and the first Google union [in 2021]. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the next 18 months after that they put $10 billion into teaching tools how to code. Like, ChatGPT comes at the end of 2022, right? It’s not entirely because of that, but it’s not not because of that. Also, like I said, [tech workers’] brains are pre-pickled. They don’t know the first thing about labor, and they’re trepidatious about learning because it’s coded “other.” Like, solidarity with the people serving meals in their workplaces is terrifying, because those people are completely disposable. None of those people have equity, none of those people have any job security. To somebody graduating college in 2026, would you recommend a career in tech? I think it’s hard. But compared to what? Compared to being a prison guard? Yes. But I do think tech is going to be the industry that is most changed by AI. Right now, ChatGPT can write a memo for you, write code for you. But the tools they’re building now, it’ll be more like one tool will replace an entire team of software engineers. For someone entering college in 2026, would you recommend studying computer science? It puts a pit in my stomach to say it, but no. I think [coding] should be part of people’s lives, for sure. But should you go into it as a career? I feel the same way about it when somebody says to me, “I’m going to learn an instrument for a living.” I’m like, “Well, hold on.” If you’re going to be the best in the world at that instrument, okay, go ahead. But if you’re not going to be the best in the world, it’s going to be a hard road for you. Last year, we heard so much about the AI bubble. Do you think we’ll see a crash in 2026? They’ve sort of economically engineered themselves out of crashing, and this is sort of similar to the de-risking of venture capital. When there's no risk, you don’t have crashes and you don’t have bailouts. And this is sort of, again, a feature of fascism versus capitalism. It was trendy in the last couple of years to call where we’re at “late-stage capitalism.” Would you call this fascism? Yeah, we’re there. Okay, the million dollar question: Do you still feel optimistic about the tech industry? Well, I have to believe. Part of the reason why is that I’ve seen it change people’s lives for the better. I think you can still build a thing that does connect the world and enables people to be part of the lives of people they love using technology. People can do it again. I think people are starting to understand the stakes. People understand that Elon Musk made a machine that makes child abuse material. I think it has to get pretty dire before people will make a change. But I think it can happen again. Do you see anybody leading that charge? There are some small projects, but I don’t want to blow anybody up yet. They’re fragile. Advertisement opens in a new tab.

Title: Ubisoft Cuts 55 more jobs in Sweden after Halifax studio closure and unionization vote

Toward the beginning of the new year, Ubisoft announced its second round of terminations amid an organizational restructuring that could affect an estimated 55 positions across its Swedish studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment. This follows a call for a voluntary leave program in the fall of 2025. Ubisoft informed its employees about these changes on January 13 and explained that they came after the completion of the voluntary program, concluding a long-term roadmap and evaluating the structure required to operate effectively. In a statement to IGN, Ubisoft said, “Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructuring that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.” The company further explained: This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clear visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainability over time. Ubisoft stressed that these layoffs were not tied to individual employee performance or recent game releases, but to structural requirements. One of the affected studios, Massive Entertainment, has been known for its work on The Division series, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It has been one of Ubisoft’s key contributors since the studio’s acquisition in 2008. Ubisoft Stockholm, on the other hand, had opened recently, collaborated on the Avatar project, and was reported to be working on an unannounced project. Ubisoft reassured the studios that these restructuring shifts would not affect their long-term roadmaps and that projects currently in development, such as The Division 3, would not be affected. To put things in perspective, this is the second wave of job cuts under Ubisoft's helm in 2026. Earlier, on January 6, Ubisoft announced the shuttering of its Halifax studio, resulting in the termination of 71 employees. Strangely, this shutdown happened right after the studio voted in favor of unionization. However, Ubisoft insists that this decision was made in tandem with the company’s efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and cut costs. The Halifax team has worked on mobile titles like Assassin’s Creed Rebellion. Buy Assassin's Creed Shadows on Amazon here IGN

Title: New World Finds its Destiny Revealed – A Shut Down Date of January 31, 2027

We knew the end was coming. We have known it was going to happen since late October when Amazon announced that they were purging their gaming studios, preferring to pursue a future built on an AI driven Snoop Dogg path than anything approximating a world. Dreams of Middle-earth crumbled and when it came to New World… well, this is what I wrote at the time. Then there is New World. That title is a dead man walking if ever there was one. We all know it. It is just a question of how much longer it will last. I won’t claim to be a clairvoyant in having predicted the obvious. As it turns out, I wasn’t even pessimistic enough. In my new year’s predictions I allowed that Amazon would announce the game’s closure, but that it might last through the end of 2026. In a surprise, especially to myself, I may have hit that one on the nose. Welcome to a New World… please exit through the gift shop Yesterday Amazon made an announcement that New World would shut down on January 31, 2027. The text of the announcement, since the support site will go away as soon as the game is gone, reads as follows: A few months ago we shared with you, our valued community, that no additional content would come to New World: Aeternum after the Nighthaven seasonal update. We also said more details on what’s happening next, alongside other essential information, would soon follow. Today, we’re here to share updates and provide transparency on where the game goes from here. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027. On January 15, 2026, the title will be delisted and no longer available for purchase. Players will still be able to play New World: Aeternum on their purchased platform, and we are extending the Nighthaven season until the servers are taken offline on January 31, 2027. We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community. It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us. I am a bit surprised Amazon kept their promise. Back in October they said they would give at least six months notice on the fate of New World. I would not have been at all surprised if they had decided to ignore that and plead special circumstances requiring an early shuttering of the game. So if you still want to play some more of New World, you have time. If you have never played it… well, the opportunity has passed for you. As noted in the quoted section above, the game was delisted and made unavailable for purchase yesterday. There was also a short FAQ appended to the announcement, which reiterates some of the points. So it will be around and they’ll keep it running. You can finish out your completionist needs, but there won’t be anything new. As for the history of the game as we enter into its final chapter… well, it was a strange ride. Amazon announced a business model of “buy the box” with a cosmetic cash shop, which was enough to move a million units pretty quickly when it launched at the end of September 2021. In the first week Steam showed it putting up big numbers, beating out the perennial favorites of the time, CS:GO and Dota 2. SteamDB numbers at 19:04 UTC on Sunday Oct 3rd That led to some amazing server queues. Server queues on Tuesday of launch week 25,001 queued up for a server… that is a hell of a queue for a server that was set to hold something like 2,000 players back at launch. But Amazon had a plan for that! They had their special sauce server technology that let them spin up new servers. There were issues, but no less than Bezos himself was talking to the press about having a hit game on his hands. And then it started going wrong. Not enough planning? Too much success? There was the launch in late September and by early December Josh Strife Hayes has a whole what went wrong video chronicling the problems and missteps of the team. By May of 2022 it was the subject of a Death of a Game video, another run through the litany of mistakes. But it didn’t go away. The team worked on the problems, released updates, and kept on going. Nothing could get that day one mojo back however. The Steam numbers declined and never bounced back anywhere close to their peak. Our group kept at it until February, then jumped over to Lost Ark. I kept an eye on the game, but every time I went back to poke my nose in, my old server had gone MIA and I had to pick a new one. But the team was still able to get a rise out of their audience… but not in a good way when they tried to rename, rebrand, re-genre the whole thing for the console launch. Old World, New Name They were clearly trying to distance themselves from the PC title and the initial announcement made people wonder if this was a new game, something different that what was out there, something only for consoles that would leave PC players behind. It was confusing in the moment. I summed up my reaction in meme form. Re-enactment of my moment of discovery… On Steam, the core remaining audience felt betrayed and the review bombing commenced. That had to sting… The team had to go into damage control mode, having realized that they had screwed up badly. Not for the first time. So the PC players felt alienated and the console customers were not enough to make up the difference. The team kept on working, but there was nothing for it. The reputation had been set. It was yesterday’s new with nothing splashy and new enough to revive its fortune. From the right angle one might be surprised that it lasted as long as it did. And who knows how the financials looked. Amazon is big enough that they can hide anything in their quarterly results. But the ongoing downturn in the industry post-Covid did for it in the end. Amazon didn’t just dump New World, it bailed on anything like deep or serious titles when the layoffs came. I will likely put together a more detailed timeline of my own views and involvement with the game when the end comes. I have a year to dwell on that. Our group dug into it for a while, and it did have its charms. It remains in my top ten most played titles on Steam, ahead of Lost Ark, if that is any consolation. We shall see how things play out over the next 12 months. Maybe somebody will buy it. Related: Never played it, but I remember around its launch hoping it was something decent. Of course also around that time I still had some faith in Amazon as a company overall. How quickly all these things change. LikeLike It definitely had things going for it and could have survived on a vibe of being sufficiently different from WoW. But the team also ignored many of the lessons of the past 20 years of online games and ended up making so many mistakes. They didn’t even have a test server until months later, so would just push patches to prod, breaking things in ways that players spotted within minutes. Had nearly a million concurrent players, and blew it. We’ve heard that story before. LikeLike I didn’t buy it and now I’m a tad regretful about that, because it might be fun to join as a tourist during the final year. The console experiment is especially sad because one recurring lesson in this space is: never give up your core audience. Whatever market you have identified to replace them almost never materializes – at a minimum it is a risk in the “foolhardy” range. Looking at you, Star Wars: Galaxies… LikeLike Yes, I am always irate when people suggest that a game could get a bazillion new players if only they would completely betray and abandon their current users to suit the tastes of that one individual. Changing horses mid-stream is complicated and has an extremely low success rate. I can think of a couple, but they mostly prove that the original idea was wrong. LikeLike I was going to do a post on it but you’ve covered everything. I’ll probably do one at some point before it closes for good but there’s no rush now. A year’s notice is plenty of time to get anything done that’s still left to do, I guess. It would be great if Amazon would sell it but they won’t, of course. It would make an excellent purchase for a smaller company with a focus on running online games, even if they only ran it in maintenance mode like Gamigo runs Rift. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t need the kind of small change a company like that would be willing to pay. Or indeed any amount of money from anyone. Maybe someone will put an emulator together. A year is a good length of time to gather all the data they’d need. LikeLike I am a bit surprised they won’t let anyone buy in this far out. I have the impression that the window is usually closer to a few months than a year, but I have zero data points to back that up and really don’t care to research it right now for a random comment, so I may be mistaken. I hope that the Rust developer (a) is serious and (b) Amazong goes for it. It seems like 25 million would be better than 0 million, but there may be a tax write off or something else behind the scense they feel is worth more. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Rust Exec Reacts To Amazon Killing New World: ‘Games Should Never Die’

Amazon Game StudiosNew WorldRust New World was once the crown jewel in Amazon’s rising gaming ambitions. Developed in-house, the MMO initially exploded in popularity on Steam and seemed to have decent legs in the notoriously competitive genre. Less than five years later, it’s officially being killed. Servers will go offline in January 2027. The news has prompted a reaction from many who are tired of big games vanishing so quickly after launch, including an executive at Rust maker Facepunch Studios. “25m, final offer Amazon Games,” the London-based company’s COO, Alistair McFarlane, wrote in response to the news on X. “Games should never die,” he added, before going on to juxtapose Amazon’s approach to online games with Facepunch’s. “As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community.” when someone asked what the Rust maker buying New World would look like. “Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.” The writing for New World has been on the wall since last fall. Despite recently releasing new updates and seasonal content changes appearing to come and go as planned, Amazon announced in late October that the game would be going on life support with no meaningful additions planned in the future. The servers would remain open and operating âthrough 2026â to allow the community âtime to continue their adventures in Aeternum.â Games should never die. — Alistair McFarlane (@Alistair_McF) January 15, 2026 While Amazon is technically holding up that end of the bargain, remaining fans probably weren’t expecting the tech giant to kick the new year off with a full-blown death sentence. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you,” an unattributed blog post that went up on the game’s website this week reads. “Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, weâre honored that we were able to share so much with the community.” New World is no longer for sale but anyone who already owns it can still re-download the game and play until January 31, 2027. Will there be any refunds? Of course not. Can you still buy premium in-game currency for real money? Strangely, yes. “Beginning July 20, 2026, players will no longer be able to purchase Marks of Fortune or anything else in game,” reads the new FAQ. Why not unlock everything and make all cash transactions in the game free? No idea. All of this stems from Amazon’s wider pivot away from internal game development, with mass layoffs last fall that included not only the end of New World but seeming cuts to other projects including a Lord of the Rings MMO. The company hasn’t confirmed if that project is dead or still being shopped around to other outside development partners.

Title: Amazon's once-hailed fantasy MMO New World will vanish from servers in a year's time

You can no longer buy it, as of this week Amazon’s colonial fantasy MMO New World (latterly rebranded New World: Aeternum) is no longer available for purchase as of yesterday, and will be taken offline for good from 31st January 2027, the publishers have announced. The news follows the release of the game’s final major update back in October, amid mass layoffs at Amazon. Alongside the similarly ill-fated Crucible and Breakaway, New World was once a key plank of Amazon’s push to become a big mover in the games industry - amplifying its existing success as a provider of software and web services, and luring yet more innocent souls into the toxic swamp of the Amazon Prime subscription business. Announced in 2016, it underwent several delays amid reports of corporate dysfunction in Amazon's embryonic studio empire, eventually launching out of beta in 2021, with a storyline conclusion landing in 2022. Alice Bee (RPS in peace) was mildly enthused by New World at launch, calling the game “a fresh, swashbuckling MMO that's still very grindy early on”. Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) liked the emphasis on crafting. It had over 700,000 players on Steam on release day. But then it proceeded to lose over 90% of its players in a matter of months. I never played New World myself, mostly because I try to avoid anything associated with Amazon, but it never struck me as particularly fascinating from afar – familiar combat and quest mechanics with some convoluted magic settler politics. Still, I’m sorry for any New World developers who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this latest “sunsetting”. In general, I'll take a lacklustre MMO over Jeff Bezos's desire to move humans into giant, Amazon-run space stations. The game’s live service will continue to operate before the servers are pulled, with recurring world bosses and bonus weeks. The devs will also keep an eye out for bugs and performance issues. But there will be no more content additions or server merges. You’ll be able to buy in-game currencies such as Marks of Fortune until July 20, 2026 – beware that Amazon are not offering refunds for such purchases. “We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” the devs write on their official site. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." Any New World veterans reading?

It didn't take long for Amazon to decide when New World would be taken offline. As you might remember, the gaming division of the giant corporation announced that no more content would be made for the game just three months ago, while also quietly canceling the in-development The Lord of the Rings MMO project. Yesterday, Amazon revealed that New World had been delisted from stores, making it unavailable for new purchases, and clarified the date the servers will go offline forever: January 31, 2027. While that's over a year away, having a definitive shutdown date is a particularly sad occurrence for any MMO. Unlike regular games, MMOs are actual virtual worlds inhabited by thousands of players on each server, creating permanent communities and social structures such as guilds. For some players, losing access is a bit like losing connection to places and people you've come to appreciate. That's why communities often fight to keep them alive one way or another. That sentiment is indeed very strong for New World, which was doing better with the latest updates released by the developers and was actually trending upward in player counts - just not as much as Amazon desired. The game's community has discussed ways to keep the game alive; there's precedent for it, chiefly with City of Heroes, the superhero-themed MMORPG created by Cryptic Studios and later acquired by NCSoft. When NCSoft shut down the game in 2012, fans spun up a private server, and the server code leak in April 2019 led to multiple private servers. One in particular, called Homecoming, eventually emerged above all others, and NCSoft granted Homecoming an official license to host the game in 2024. That was about the best outcome New World fans could hope for. However, in a veritable twist, Alistair McFarlane, COO and Company Director at Facepunch (the British developer behind Rust and Garry's Mod), tweeted a $25 million 'offer' to purchase the game from Amazon, adding that 'games should never die'. Needless to say, having an actual professional game studio pick up the game would be far better. Amazon also demonstrated they are not actually averse to the idea; as part of their mass gaming layoffs, they sold the upcoming MOBA, March of Giants, to Ubisoft. The difference is that in that case, they sold the game alongside the development team based in Montréal, Canada, whereas most of the New World team is likely already gone. This would make it hard for a game like New World to sustain itself over time. Unlike sandbox games like Rust or Garry's Mod, the MMO is mostly themepark-based, meaning it sustains itself on developer-made content rather than user-generated content. Even if it acquired the license, Facepunch would still have to build a small team to keep it going and add new content every once in a while. We've reached out to Facepunch to ask whether McFarlane's offer was genuine in the first place and will update this story if and when they respond.

Title: Scrutinizing the Retail Sector, Feel-good Mood Prevails at NRF Big Show

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily After a holiday season of decent gains, retailers expect more of the same in 2026 with most facets of the economy seen holding up. Considering the world is in turmoil, economic uncertainties persist, and Saks Global has gone bankrupt, this week’s NRF Big Show at Manhattan’s Javits Center was a surprisingly reassuring place to be. Resilient consumer spending, the rise of AI, waning fear over tariffs, and expectations for retail gains in the year ahead following a decent 2025 holiday season set a promising tone at the convention/trade show, considered the industry’s biggest. Adding to the upbeat atmosphere were the keynoters recounting personal and professional success stories and the record turnout — 40,000-plus retailers, vendors, suppliers, media, industry analysts and consultants — creating crowds at the doughnut and coffee stands and competition for seats close to the speaker stages. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Vans, Timberland and The North Face Leaders on What It Takes to Reignite Brand Energy Beauty Features Ulta Beauty's Kecia Steelman on AI, Cultural Relevance, International and More Still, concerns were not in short supply. They centered on inflation persisting; lower-income families struggling to get by amid high grocery, housing and health costs, and the potential impact of AI on the labor force. You May Also Like “It was a good holiday season overall, up 4.7 percent from October through December. It looked to us that people shopped early, were picky and selective. The wealth effect is a huge part of the story, kind of masking the weakness in lower incomes,” said David Tinsley, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, during a economic outlook session. “You can have a relatively weak lower-income consumer but still have a robust outcome. There’s a tenuous relationship between consumer sentiment and what people actually do. I suspect you have pretty depressed consumers along with pretty robust consumption.” For 2026, “It’s not all pessimism for the lower-income consumer,” Tinsley said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill could be quite significant, with an increase in tax refunds between $60 billion and $80 billion. We could see quite large increases in spending on discretionary goods, travel and leisure, but it’s hard to know how it falls out in terms of who will benefit. There is some hope this K-shape economy narrows a bit. One area that gives me concern is the housing market. You need housing transactions to generate demand for all sorts of goods and services.” Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said, “The stock market was a powerful stimulus in the back half of the year. The overall economy is growing strongly. We forecast that to continue this year.” Though he’s concerned about slow job growth, on the positive side, “The impact of tariffs will be fading in 2026 in terms of change. There’s support coming from fiscal policy, interest rate cuts, lowering mortgage rates, and add in tailwinds from AI,” for productivity gains. He also said the bigger tax cuts will be going to higher income households, but with that, he sees wage growth and inflation falling back. “it’s the worst labor market in over a decade, layoffs remain low and that should continue this year,” said Pearce. “If you are employed you are still seeing wage gains and the risk of a layoff is relatively low. But young people of all ages are struggling in this slow labor market. If you are out of the labor market, it’s difficult to get back in.” On AI, Pearce said, “We are still in the relative early stages of this AI boom. The adoption rate across the economy continues to pick up. It’s mostly being financed out of earnings rather than using debt.” “What my father started 60 years ago was a brand based on his own philosophy of design — that products were created and designed with an idea of timelessness, things that get better with age,” said David Lauren, who focused on Ask Ralph, the virtual shopping and styling assistant on the Ralph Lauren app. Lauren, the son of Ralph Lauren and the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, said, “Technology has been the most incredible tool for us to take that philosophy and make it relevant for a new generation. The idea that clothes could be worn and passed down from generation to generation has to be shared with the new generation in a way that comes in their language.” Lauren said that Ralph Lauren was the first luxury fashion brand to sell on the internet. “No one had ever sold a $500 cashmere sweater online. No one had ever sold a suit online. We just thought this would be an interesting way to tell our story.” The company turned to Microsoft to bring the experience of the Ralph Lauren flagship on 72nd Street to the internet. Microsoft staffers spent three hours immersing themselves in the store to understand the culture, to create Ask Ralph. “Nobody needs a tie. Nobody needs a flannel shirt. Nobody needs another pair of jeans,” he said. But that can change when customers are “enveloped in the magic of Ralph Lauren. We feel that the technology helps us to fulfill that.” Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president, worldwide industry solutions for Microsoft, said that the Ask Ralph technology is “like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket advising you.” Lauren agreed, adding: “When a customer starts to feel confident about putting a look together, that’s a win.” Although the tool is only available for the Polo brand right now, Lauren said he expects it will be expanded to the company’s other offerings in the future. “As we expand it globally and bring our other brands to it, I think we’re going to get a much richer read on it.” In a “future proofing retail in 2028” session, Ashley Kechter, global president of athletic apparel brand Vuori, said “Integration between retail and digital is imperative” and stressed the importance of the customer experience. Vuori’s Regent Street store in London, which opened last year, is different from its L.A. store, Kechter said, because the company evaluates what’s right for the local customer and builds an experience unique to that store site. Dayna Quanbeck, president of shoe brand Rothy’s, stressed “the balance of both and how you build that model” of digital and physical stores is where the focus should be. Another focus for Rothy’s is on “testing and learning” to spot trends and determine “green shoots” for growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rothy’s launched bags and men’s shoes, but ultimately decided to keep its focus on innovating in women’s footwear. She said the company saw a huge opportunity in bags and men’s shoes, but it wasn’t the right time. For Rothy’s, the non-negotiable is sustainability — last fall the brand innovated a more sustainable way to manufacture velvet — while the biggest challenge is intellectual property. “We have a roster of patents that are often knocked off,” she said. Erin Chaney, senior vice president of e-commerce, Adidas NA, and Peter Larsen, vice president of multichannel commerce and fulfillment at Amazon, discussed their collaboration and how it’s setting new fulfillment standards for the footwear industry. “We’re getting faster every single year,” Larsen said of the marketplace platform’s delivery improvements. The collaboration with Adidas meant Amazon had to think differently about the supply chain because “Adidas has many products that turn over frequently,” Larsen said. Chaney said one challenge involved supply and how the two had to “synchronize” their respective inventory feeds. Some early marketplace orders saw cancellations because the German athletic brand wasn’t as fast on their end with inventory information and what was available for shipment. Once that was figured out, Adidas began seeing the revenue uplift it had expected and higher conversion rates. Chaney also said a pain point was callers to customer service asking where packages were and when they would be delivered. But with the collaboration, Amazon Prime-enabled deliveries are now within two to three days. The reduction of those service calls were a “big win” for Adidas, Chaney said. For LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, incorporating AI isn’t about removing the human touch in luxury — from handcrafted handbags and hand-sewn couture to white-glove customer service. It’s about heightening personal experiences and helping the company deliver on its “human values,” namely creativity and innovation, excellence and entrepreneurship. That message came from Gonzague de Pirey, chief omnichannel and data officer at LVMH, who said, “Human is a core value of luxury, and if we want to successfully develop technology, it needs to be everywhere, but visible nowhere.” He said the company calls this concept “quiet tech.” Many companies use AI as a means toward efficiency, but for LVMH, the goal was primarily business development and supporting the group’s values. After piloting and scaling a few use cases over the last couple years, LVMH embarked on a group-wide AI transformation plan. Recognizing that each of its more than 75 houses is unique, the conglomerate is enabling each business unit to develop its own plan that fits its DNA. Although brand specific, these strategies address a few common priorities: commerce, marketing and operations. Within Louis Vuitton, AI investments are focused on four key areas: enhancing creativity, reaching the right clients, elevating the customer experience and operational efficiencies, such as demand planning. “It’s a way to dream boldly, execute, invest on the topics and initiatives that really prove we can move the needle impacting our business and our client experience,” said Soumia Hadjali, Louis Vuitton’s global senior vice president, client development and digital. Using AI for creative purposes comes with risks, so LVMH is testing the combination of AI and creativity at some houses. For instance, at Louis Vuitton, AI is being used to help designers visualize materials and colors faster, providing more time to focus on craftsmanship and the narrative behind the products. AI is also being leveraged to generate e-commerce assets. In customer engagement, the use of AI is about “augmentation, not automation,” providing client advisers with consumer insights to support engagement, explained Hadjali. “AI really opened the capabilities, and the signature remains really human and distinctive,” she said. Louis Vuitton’s use of agentic commerce goes beyond the transactional. Hadjali described it as “orchestrating that entire ecosystem around one client,” creating a personalized experience and journey based on insights about the customer. With millions of clients, AI is about delivering experience and relevance at the right time, at scale. “It’s mainly about anticipating, understanding, integrating, responding to our clients’ intents, and building at the same time, trust, legitimacy,” she said. Two years into the future of AI at LVMH, de Pirey said a marker of success would be to involve everyone in the company with a culture very open to AI. “That would translate into, of course, greater business, greater market share, greater performance, greater financial performance. If we are able to, thanks to AI, increase the desire for our brands, that would be the absolute key for success.” Emma Grede, cofounder of the Good American and Skims brand, and Ben Francis, CEO and founder of Gymshark, outlined what made their companies successful and how agentic AI is part of it. Grede said that because customers are already exploring AI, it behooved her businesses to do the same. “We’re in the midst of a really seismic change,” she said. “To be where our customer is, we have no other choice than to be in it.” She views AI as a “second executive brain” that can take on tasks done by staffers. “We built these incredible businesses based on what the data is telling us, by being obsessed with our customer and obsessed with the product. But there’s a whole other side of what we do — market research and obsessing over the competition that, quite frankly, AI can do at a speed no human would ever find manageable. So for me, it’s not about taking anything human out of what we do, it’s actually leaving ourselves the time to do the stuff only we can do.” Francis said that when he founded Gymshark in 2012, it was strictly online. Gymshark has since opened stores, though digital still represents the bulk of the business. But his goal remains the same: “to build the greatest gym apparel brand in the world, in a market that is so saturated by sports, athleisure and fashion.” Although tempted, he’s resisted expanding the offering beyond his core product to boost sales, and it’s paid off. “We found that as we narrowed our product base, we’ve narrowed our focus…And the business has grown far more quickly than when we were trying to appeal to everyone,” he said. Gymshark has built a $1 billion business with just eight physical stores and a big online business. With brick-and-mortar, “It’s so easy to over-expand and alienate that core customer, but the second [you] do that, it’s very difficult to recover.” When Good American launched a decade ago, it offered product up to size 15, breaking the conventional rules of fashion. But because she was an “outsider,” Grede said she didn’t feel compelled to follow the rules. “You can no sooner launch a cosmetics brand with 10 shades of foundation than you can launch a clothing brand with this very narrow idea of what size people’s butts should be.” She followed the same playbook with Skims, which also paid dividends. “For me, it was just about taking out all of the preconceived notions…We’re not very referential. I think that’s our superpower. We don’t forecast trend, we create trend.” Stefani Fleurant, executive vice president of lifestyle marketing at Authentic Brands Group, said among the brand management and entertainment platform’s biggest hits have been Lucky Brand’s back-to-school campaign with Addison Rae, Aeropostale’s collaboration with Demetra Dias, and Reebok’s deal with WNBA star Angel Reece. These breakthrough consumer moments are part of Authentic’s mission to “acquire, protect and grow” its 50-plus brands through a “digital-first strategy.” Fleurant said the company early on worked with creatives to get its message out. But in recent years, consumers have gotten more selective. “Product has to earn its place,” she said. Creators have to “drive credibility,” she said, and help develop storytelling for each brand. Fleurant said Aeropostale actually brought Diaz on board as an intern last summer, where she co-created her collection with the company. When it dropped, Aeropostale skyrocketed to number three on the shopping section of the app store for that weekend. While JD Sports Fashion plc is an early adopter of agentic commerce evolution, it’s not losing sight of a fundamental point of retail: delivering on promises across channels. “As a retailer, the main goal is to serve your clients in the best way in every single place they want to be served,” said Olivier Nachba, deputy chief technology officer at JD Sports, in a conversation with Fluent Commerce’s chief strategy officer Nicola Kinsella. Around 20 percent of JD Group’s sales come from online channels; 80 percent is stores. Roughly 50 percent of its customer base is young, including teenagers who are early tech adopters. Nachba sees agentic commerce as another channel and opportunity for JD Sports to reach customers. Preparing for agentic commerce, JD Sports is getting its communications ready with generative engine optimization. Like search engine optimization before it, GEO is about sharing product data in a way that enables information to be gleaned by large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini. Through GEO, JD Sports is gearing up for a global presence across every LLM. And to populate GEO, the company needs good data and content. “Our challenge is how we are going to be able to generate enough valid content targeted for our customer at scale level,” said Nachba. “We are leveraging a lot of AI to give superpower to our teams.” With agentic commerce, much like online searches linking to e-commerce sites, there is the risk that comes with being on the same platform as competitors. Nachba pointed to delivery as a competitive asset, and this is where order management systems come into play. “Order management system is a backbone of your operation (and) how you are going to serve your clients, and it’s a backbone of your delivery promise of your customer and your stock optimization,” said Nachba. “But what is really important is to understand how you are going to make people work around the order management system.” Without cross-organization alignment, Nachba explained a company’s brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce department could have competing priorities for order fulfillment, since they each want to move inventory out of their channel to protect their bottom lines. Order management systems like Fluent Commerce start with what the consumer wants to order and use rules — such as choosing the fulfillment method with the least emissions or the option that provides the best margins — to determine how to get the customer their desired product. The OMS also allows retailers to show customers expected delivery timelines. Given the significant portion of company sales that are via brick-and-mortar locations, Nachba said the in-store experience needs to provide the “best service.” This includes arming associates with training and tools so they can get product to the customer even if it is not in stock at that particular door. JD Group has linked up with CommerceTools and Stripe, becoming the first retailer to use their agentic commerce suite. This will enable it to sell on platforms like ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot in the U.S., a market that accounts for roughly 40 percent of the group’s $15 billion global business. “You need to have a clean house,” he said. “You can’t build something if the ground floor is not solid, so we are doing the job with all the team to have a structured data, an exposition of our data, the…source of truth of every single aspect of our business, to be sure that we will be able to leverage it.” Marco Benasedo, chief information officer at Boggi, the Milan menswear brand that hosted a breakfast at its store on Columbus Circle with tech partner Hekanize, cautioned that while Boggi is open to using AI, it is not at the expense of humans. He stressed that any action centered around creativity is still being performed by people since the human touch cannot be underestimated. By embracing technology, cumbersome tasks previously handled by headquarters and store staff can be reallocated, including inventory control and connecting frontline workers with back-office details needed to do jobs effectively. Brooklinen CEO Billy May and Steve Madden direct-to-consumer president Josh Krepon hammered down on today’s retail realities. Krepon acknowledged the impact AI is having on the world but he believes the retail industry will move a bit slower to adopt the technology. “I don’t have a lot of concern for jobs on the brand side,” Krepon said. “We’re still on the augment phase, and I do think AI will actually create new jobs over the next 10 to 20 years.” May concurred, saying, “If it’s a rote process that can certainly be automated, then that individual can move elsewhere in the company. Is there going to be mass layoffs? No. Will it be a redistribution of talent, 100 percent. And I think that organizations or functions that aren’t thinking about how to incorporate AI right now are the ones that are going to end up being most affected. The only way to predict the future is to be a part of it. You’ve got to be actively engaged and adopting and thinking about how to integrate AI into your organization, out of opportunity, as opposed to out of fear.” – With contributions from Sarah Jones, Vicki M.

Title: New World will join the graveyard of defunct MMOs when it goes offline in 2027

The MMO's last season will be extended until its final day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New World, the only Amazon game that stuck around long enough to find a steady amount of players, is now being ushered toward the graveyard with all the other games the ecommerce megacorp has shut down for good. And now we have the date for its final day: January 31, 2027. The game has now been delisted from Steam and every platform you could buy it on, and will only be playable by anyone who already owns it. Amazon says in a post about the news that the only way to refund the game is to contact the customer service of the platform you bought it on. There will be no refunds for Marks of Fortune, the MMO's premium currency. The MMO will remain playable for the next year until the servers shut down, but there won't be any future updates other than bug fixes and performance updates. While the game remains in stasis, its Nighthaven season will continue all the way until the end. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the post reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community." New World's end was preceded by a massive round of layoffs in October that slashed around 14,000 jobs at Amazon. It said they were part of "strategic changes" at the company and that it would halt "a significant amount" of first-party game development, particularly around MMOs. That same day, Amazon announced that it was "no longer sustainable to continue supporting [New World] with new content updates," and that its Nighthaven update would be its last. Developers on the game snuck a goodbye letter into the update, which was pointed out by one of the senior game designers after it dropped. It would be hard to call New World an explosive success, but it certainly wasn't a flop. Although the MMO never reached Final Fantasy 14 or World of Warcraft levels, it did bounce between 50,000 and 60,000 concurrent players on Steam after it was released. That's quite a lot for a newer MMO in an age where MMOs don't really catch on like it used to. Star Wars: The Old Republic hovers around 5,000 concurrent players on Steam, but whatever it's doing must be enough for EA to keep it around. I can only imagine Amazon had absurdly high expectations for it after watching it bring in more than a million players on release. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even though New World still has a year of life left, I will be curious to see if anyone manages to find a way to spin up private servers of it. Earlier this week, EA's live service shooter Anthem shut down, and its project lead suggested that there's a version of the game out there that could be turned into a private server if someone were to get their hands on it. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Tyler has covered videogames and PC hardware for 15 years.

Title: Amazon Puts the Nail in the Coffin: New World Aeternum Delisted Today, Will Go Offline January 2027

After Amazon killed New World Aeternum by cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly delisting the game as of today, January 15, 2026. Second, by announcing that the game will go offline on January 31, 2027. A blog post on the official New World website begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "provide transparency on where the game goes from here." Which, essentially, is nowhere. "New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027.Learn more: https://t.co/FK9O07Hm0F pic.twitter.com/UBXHaetLSz You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until July 20, 2026; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that refunds will not be available for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life. New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "significant" layoffs as part of Amazon's mass 14,000+ company-wide layoff last year. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising. It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up huge player numbers, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." "It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."

Title: Fewer-than-expected number of Americans filed jobless claims last week, as layoffs remain low

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. READ MORE: Sluggish hiring closes out a frustrating year for job seekers Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren't yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as "low hire, low fire." READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here's what experts say they mean Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday's report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 3 declined by 19,000 to 1.88 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: How to Gain Footing in AI as the Ground Keeps Shifting
URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-developer-career-advice
Time Published: 2026-01-15T19:00:02Z
Full Content:
IEEE career guide offers tips on thriving amid ever-changing tech Willie Jones covers transportation for IEEE Spectrum and the history of technology for The Institute. The newly released Preparing for a Career as an AI Developer guide from the IEEE Computer Society argues that the most durable path to artificial intelligence jobs is not defined by mastering any single tool or model. Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills—capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace. AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze cybercrime, predict equipment failures in manufacturing, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to mass layoffs across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals. Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the banking, health care, retail, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making—and keep up with the competition. The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by San Murugesan and Rodica Neamtu. Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains. The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework. AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy. Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write. The guide cites surveys of executives about AI’s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by McKinsey & Co. The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants’ insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate. The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve. The strategic approach aligns with advice from Neil Thompson, director of FutureTech research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,” he says. “Applying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.” Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data, machine learning, and computing infrastructure. Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say. Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say. Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure is important, according to the guide’s authors. Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms. Python has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models. The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. PyTorch, developed by Meta AI, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. Scikit-learn provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. —Neil Thompson, MIT TensorFlow, a software library for machine learning and AI created by Google, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction. The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as résumé keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints. Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders. Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt. The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience. Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career. Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide. Each starting point reinforces the guide’s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance. Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process. “Always be curious,” he says. “Learn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.” Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one’s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend. In a field where today’s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide’s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.

Life is Strange: Double Exposure developer Deck Nine Games will reveal the next Life is Strange game next week on January 20, 2026, in a live stream that will kick off at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, who walk across the frame in the teaser. Separate the real from the rumor... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game: https://t.co/29yzDsGCb5January 20. 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. pic.twitter.com/jYQphhU2e3 It's believed that the game revealed next week will be 'Life is Strange: Reunion,' a title that leaked from a PEGI ratings listing just last week. 2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning. This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure. Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans. In the meantime, if you're looking for more Life is Strange, Amazon has greenlit a TV series adaptation of the franchise led by Kaos writer Charlie Covell.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000.

Across Big Tech, companies are tightening worker oversight amid layoffs, AI-driven job anxiety, and cuts to entry-level roles. If 2025 was about bosses calling on workers to be hardcore, 2026 is about making sure they actually do it. A look inside two of the biggest players reveals what heightened accountability can look like: Business Insider exclusively reported this month that Amazon stepped up efforts to let managers track employee badge swipes and revised performance reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments. Meanwhile, Business Insider also learned that Meta is using dashboards to track workers' AI usage and simplifying its review structure with a winner-take-more approach that better rewards the highest performers. It is also cutting about 10% of workers at its metaverse division. Taken together, the moves signal that Big Tech is ratcheting up the stakes for workers who find themselves in a market that's sluggish for seemingly all but AI's shiniest superstars.

The ante-upping comes as companies are pumping massive sums into AI — and, in many cases, are still waiting for the returns to materialize. A desire to see more performance metrics may stem from a need to quantify how workers are using AI to boost productivity. "I suspect in a lot of tech firms, there is kind of a mood of panic," Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told Business Insider, referring to executives' fear of falling behind in the AI race. Bidwell added that the sense of urgency coming from the top around AI then leads to the question, "How do we make sure we're squeezing the most out of people?" Big Tech's answer? Go big on metrics. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. It's not just Amazon and Meta. Microsoft has worked to shed its "country club" reputation, while Google has also changed how it rates employees to incentivize outsize performance. Productivity dashboards, tool-usage metrics, and increasingly granular performance evaluations are becoming central to how managers gauge value. The goal, executives say, is to ensure accountability and reward top performers. The shift is also philosophical: Productivity isn't assumed. It has to be proven. At Amazon, managers have a dashboard to track how much time workers are spending at its corporate outposts — and to flag those who are brushing off the company's return-to-office mandate. The company, as part of its performance review process, is asking its corporate workers to provide three to five accomplishments that exemplify their work. Meta is also adjusting how it keeps score of workers' performance — in part by giving more frequent feedback and tightening the focus on "rewarding outstanding performance," a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider earlier this month. The demand for greater productivity isn't limited to tech. Citi CEO Jane Fraser sent a memo to the bank's staff on Wednesday, entitled "The bar is raised," in which she made it clear to Citi's more than 200,000 workers that she expects them to raise their standards in 2026. "We are not graded on effort. We are judged on our results," Fraser wrote in the memo. The power moves from Big Tech likely reflect a mix of factors, industry observers said. There is the expectation that AI will supercharge workers; yet, there is also a view that something has to justify the massive outlays on the technology. Spending on AI tools that help programmers write code, for example, can bring with it the expectation from management that workers become faster and more efficient. At Incedo, an enterprise AI and data firm, coding assistants have helped boost workers' productivity between 25% and 40%, Nitin Seth, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider. "As that is happening, there is a squeeze on jobs," he said. Across tech, Seth said, that can mean an imperative to produce more or cut jobs — or both. Incedo has reduced workers because of AI's productivity windfall, he said, though the company continues to hire data engineers among other roles. The company didn't specify how many roles it has cut. Even so, Seth said, AI's productivity bounce in the tech industry hasn't been as great so far as some bosses and boards would like. He said that by the final months of 2025, many business leaders experienced the "sobering realization" that while the early gains from AI were impressive, carving out further wins had proven difficult. Seth likens the AI environment to that of roads and cars — where AI infrastructure is the road and an AI use case is the car. Companies have been spending big on the roads, Seth said, but as yet, "there aren't too many cars." There's also a sunnier take: Leaders feel compelled to "better justify" the people they employ in order to protect their jobs, said Christopher Myers, the faculty director of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The idea, he told Business Insider, is that dashboards make it clear what workers are doing. It's a way of competing with the readily available metrics on what AI is churning through. One clear fallout is that employers will be able to save money by pushing out low performers, Myers said. RTO mandates, he said, can also be a way of letting go of workers unwilling to comply. Whatever's behind it, he said, leaders' thinking appears to be, "I'm really going to grade hard." It's likely that investors are worried about the number of workers at some companies, said Wharton's Bidwell. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter — and the company's ability to carry on even after deep staff cuts — some investors have concluded that tech firms' pandemic-era bloat could be eliminated, Bidwell said. "He came in. He fired everybody. It didn't fall over," he said of Musk. That has led to what Bidwell sees as "a big cultural shift" in tech about the need to hire the best and the brightest — if only to keep them from going to competitors. The shift means that leaders in Silicon Valley are asking tougher questions about who is pulling their weight. That pressure, Incedo's Seth said, then falls on managers and, ultimately, down to rank-and-file tech workers who are seeing increased performance expectations. "There is greater pressure, greater anxiety, and it's kind of like a snowball effect," he said. Do you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The great middle manager flattening is in full swing, and those who remain are seeing their dominions balloon. It's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. Managers' average number of reports — their "span of control" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. Are you a manager with 25 or more direct reports, or have been asked to take on more reports in the "Great Flattening?" Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.

In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. "We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development." What's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. "When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached," Harter said. "We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better." Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. Gallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status," Harter said. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."

The Menlo Park-based company announced the layoffs Tuesday morning in an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth first seen by Bloomberg. Earlier reporting from the paper cites estimates that Reality Labs employs about 15,000 workers, making the cuts roughly 10% of the division's workforce. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton wrote in a statement to state press outlet SFGate. The move was a “part of that effort,” and Meta plans to “reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” Clayton added. Meta’s cuts arrive as the first major tech layoff of 2026, after large workforce reductions tapered off late last year. In November 2022, Meta cut about 11,000 employees in one of the largest layoffs in its history, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg simultaneously reaffirmed the company’s long-term commitment to the metaverse. The move exposed early tension between Reality Labs’ mounting losses and investor pressure for efficiency, even as Meta insisted the strategy remained intact. By the end of the same year, Meta’s metaverse push appeared to struggle due to weak user adoption, unclear consumer demand, and the growing financial drag of Reality Labs. As capital tightened and interest rates rose, the scale of the bet became harder to justify, setting the stage for the company’s current shift away from its previously heavy metaverse investment. Still, the roughly 1,000 roles being eliminated in Reality Labs represent a small fraction of the roughly 154,000 technology job losses recorded across 2025, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Technology has been pivoting to both developing and implementing artificial intelligence much more quickly than any other industry. This, coupled with over-hiring over the last decade, created a wave of job loss in the industry,” the research firm wrote. The tech sector led all private industries in layoffs last year, with job cuts rising 15% from 2024. Industry data compiled by Layoffs.fyi show that tech layoffs fell sharply into late 2025, dropping from 18,510 in October to 8,932 in November and to around 300 in December, as large, headline-scale workforce reductions tapered off heading into year-end. Among its FAANG peers, Meta’s move appears modest in scale. Amazon accounted for the largest workforce reductions within the group over the past year, cutting tens of thousands of roles across retail, devices, and AWS through multiple rounds, per layoff data sourced from public reports. Google and Microsoft implemented smaller but recurring layoffs, generally in the low thousands per round, tied to cost controls and AI-driven restructuring, while continuing to hire selectively in priority areas. Apple largely avoided mass layoffs, relying instead on attrition and slower hiring, while Netflix made limited cuts, typically numbering in the hundreds, as it adjusted operations following changes to its password-sharing model. Records on the California Employment Development Department do not yet show that a worker adjustment and retraining notice (WARN) attributed to Meta has been filed as of Wednesday morning, per Decrypt's review. The EDD “has not received any WARN notices from Meta,” a spokesperson told Decrypt after confirming with their WARN unit. Decrypt has reached out to Meta and will update this story should they respond.

Title: Meta is changing its performance review to reward output over effort, taking a page from Amazon and X

Meta Platforms Inc. just became the latest tech company to rejig its performance review process to hone in on an employee’s output, as opposed to effort. The company is rolling out a new performance review platform called Checkpoint, which will grade workers, grouping them into four categories and rewarding top performers for exceptional work, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. “We’re evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.” The memo outlined the predicted distribution of outcomes and pay multipliers for base bonuses. About 20% of employees will be labeled “Outstanding” and will be eligible for a bonus double their pay; 70% will be labeled “Excellent” with a 115% pay bonus; around 7% will fall into the “Needs Improvement” category, eligible for a bonus up to 50% of pay. Around 3% of employees may be labeled “Not Meeting Expectations” and will be ineligible for a bonus. On the other hand, the system will reward top performers with bonuses worth up to 300%. The performance review update comes as other Big Tech companies have overhauled their performance review systems to better reflect employee performance. Amazon’s new review system asks corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work. And in 2022, Elon Musk asked X (formerly Twitter) employees to explain what they accomplished every week. Meta is planning a company-wide meeting Jan. 22 to further explain the changes to employees. The new changes will impact the 2026 performance cycle and will not change the current review cycle. The new system will entail two review cycles per year, using the same rating system each cycle. As part of this new review timeline, bonuses will be paid out twice annually. Tech companies have increasingly sought concrete examples of output as proof of productivity, requiring that employees demonstrate how well they perform. While outcomes have been a longstanding cornerstone of corporate performance reviews, the new push toward output-based assessments reflects a growing desire among tech leaders to incentivize employees to prove outstanding performance. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has pushed to reduce management layers and to eliminate bureaucracy since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2022 that he was aiming to make the company more lean to promote “product excellence and productivity.” That has been the trend at Meta, where the tech company called 2023 the “year of efficiency” as the company scaled back headcount. In 2022, the company laid off about 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees. And last year, the company cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 3,000 workers, targeting low performers. To be sure, an update to Meta’s performance review system is not a warning sign that additional layoffs are on their way. But Meta is set to announce layoffs this week in the company’s Reality Labs business, according to reporting by The New York Times, as the company scales back its metaverse unit. “We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ahead of last year’s cuts. “But now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.”

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs

Meta is laying off around 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: 9 marketing predictions for 2026 as AI fuels polarity

Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The sense of a stable middle ground is eroding across an industry at a point of contraction, with many displaying mixed feelings about marketing’s future. The sense of a stable middle ground will continue to erode across several aspects of marketing in 2026. Studies indicate the middle class is thinning, altering important consumer milestones. Monoculture is also on the wane as people spend more time engaged with algorithms hypertailored to their interests. On the industry front, marketing services are gravitating toward two polarities in the wake of historic consolidation: White-glove models and plug-and-play ones built around artificial intelligence. Feeling some of the most pain from these developments are the employees who make the industry hum but are facing a grim job market. “There has been a rampant uptick in the past few years of putting the focus on shareholder value,” said Dustin Black, executive creative director at Preston Spire. “Culturally, the difference between decision-makers and makers has never been greater.” The advancement of generative AI could encourage mediocrity — “slop” was deemed a 2025 word of the year for a reason — but also benefit marketers moving against the grain. To grab attention, brands may embrace messaging that is deliberately button-pushing or bold. “A lot of the output is trending toward the median,” said Taryn Crouthers, CEO of Spcshp, about AI in marketing. “It’s about pulling against the median because all of the content is merging to look very, very similar.” Others could step up investment in emergent channels to reach audiences with growing economic influence, including Gen Alpha. There will be no shortage of stages to test these tactics, with a Super Bowl, Olympics and FIFA World Cup on deck. Below, Marketing Dive shares nine predictions for an industry at a point of contraction and displaying mixed feelings about its future. Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group signals more agency consolidation coming down the pike, experts say. As rumors swirl around additional breakups and sell-offs, a new chapter is on the horizon for ad-holding groups. “It’s absolutely signifying a shift towards media and technology scale as key foundational elements for what the legacy holding companies will reorganize around,” said Jay Pattisall, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, of the Omnicom-IPG deal. Dealmaking activity could be enabled by further interest rate cuts and a light-touch regulatory environment. Other agencies may broker richer strategic partnerships: For example, Publicis kicked off 2026 by striking a pact with LiveRamp, underpinning the significance of data in the AI arms race, Ad Age reported. Massive layoffs and the death of iconic creative shops — not to mention the likelihood of future cost-cutting measures — have been painful but also mean that an army of talent is seeking its next venture. “You might see a lot of these former executives trying to start their own firms playing to the more niche side of the marketplace,” said Paul Hardart, a clinical professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Independents meanwhile may pursue different routes to expansion. ZMC-backed Wpromote’s purchase of Giant Spoon in late 2025 speaks to the role private equity is playing in the formation of “big indies” that could appeal to deep-pocketed brands. “Not tomorrow, not next month, but in the not-so-distant future, there are going to be more options for enterprise marketers to choose from as a result of the private-equity investments in what we historically call independent digital agencies,” said Pattisall. Brands will further push the limits of AI-generated creative in 2026, with football’s big night acting as a key litmus test. Svedka already announced it will run a Super Bowl spot made with AI, but the spirits maker won’t be the only advertiser putting on an AI showcase. “I would say, more likely than not, 50% of all Super Bowl spots we watch this year will utilize generative AI in some facet,” said Chris Neff, chief AI officer at Anomaly, noting that those applications could be in pre-production and not immediately apparent on screen. While the AI content spigot is flowing, marketers will explore different messaging avenues. Brands, including Equinox and Dollar Shave Club, have recently launched campaigns that prod at the backlash to AI slop while still leveraging generative AI tools. However, many continue to underestimate strong consumer aversion. “Rushing into anything — over doing things to that extent — is a mistake,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of PR firm DKC. “One thing that humans seem to still possess...is a pretty good B.S. detector.” Trepidation around AI extends into other areas, even as the technology becomes institutionalized at brands and agencies. Artificially inflated engagement may create a negative feedback loop for advertisers that are only investing more in social and digital, contributing to the Dead Internet Theory. “The bot traffic is going to increase. Is that going to make the metrics even better? Is that going to be the catalyst for this vicious cycle for it to get worse and worse and worse?” said Neff. “It's very hard to know exactly what’s real and not.” “[Brands are] playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” Bill Bruno CEO of Celebrus Advertisers, agencies and other stakeholders have spent years shoring up their land grabs in the data-driven marketing ecosystem to fuel developments like programmatic advertising and help gird against the shift from identifiers like third-party cookies. That rush for data will continue to intensify amid the rise and operationalization of AI-driven advertising, giving marketers a chance to learn and apply the lessons of previous eras. Data transparency and ownership will be key as AI complicates challenges that marketers already face around ad visibility and efficacy, especially amid the rise of zero-click search and AI-powered bots and agents that could muddy measurement waters. “You've got a lot of brands… that are basically using terms like ‘AI readiness’ that don't know what they need or what they're going to do, necessarily,” explained Bill Bruno, CEO of data firm Celebrus. “I don't think a lot of people are thinking two or three steps ahead right now. They're playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” To have a better handle on data, marketers can shift focus from collecting data to connecting it via tools like consumer data platforms and data fabric environments that give a more unified view of consumers, several experts said. That can help marketers focus on exactly what they need, rather than getting washed away in a flood of data. “My clients who have been most successful are focusing on marketing-specific use-case data readiness,” said Nicole Greene, vice president, analyst at Gartner. “Do we really know what our customers want? Can we safeguard the data that they have entrusted us with, and as a result, can we do marketing and advertising better?” "I don’t think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women... It’s more being true to what the company and what the audience is." Adam Singer Vice president of marketing at AdQuick Some of last year’s boldest advertising featured good jeans, spicy plumbers, the best car to have sex in and a full bush summer. Similarly edgy ad creative could return to the fore as marketers look to break through in an increasingly fragmented and frantic media landscape. While those campaigns relied on — and often parodied — “sex sells” tropes, their success speaks more to their ability to break through an ad landscape that has grown increasingly stale and bland, even before the rise of AI, said Adam Singer, vice president of marketing at AdQuick. “Companies have become really risk averse. I think consumers are really thirsty for brands to do things that are interesting,” Singer said. However, being bold doesn’t mean that brands must turn back the clock and revive aesthetics and attitudes that have largely fallen by the cultural wayside. “I don't think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women or even necessarily really attractive celebrities, although celebrities definitely push product,” Singer said. “It's more being true to what the company and what the audience is.” Marketers can bring this type of authenticity to life in several ways, from emotional messages to simply portraying their products with beautiful photography and videography — as long as the company is authentic to its core values. Last year’s Cracker Barrel rebrand fiasco is an example of what not to do. “Everyone tried to make that a political thing and say it was ‘woke,’ but I don't think that's really what was going on,” Singer said. “We've seen companies flattening everything, making everything a little bit more boring, and people are tired of that. They want brands to do big, bold things.” Marketers should prepare for further consolidation in an ad-tech industry that has reached maturity but continues to evolve alongside technological change. “At different areas in the ecosystem, there is a consolidation of the media activation between DSPs and SSPs — most of them are starting to compete with each other and not just partner with each other anymore,” said Mathieu Roche, CEO of identity firm ID5. In the DSP space, Amazon and Walmart continue to develop their offerings, while Microsoft’s sunsetting of Xandr provided a boost to Amazon via a transition partnership. Some brands have looked to test different sell-side workflows, including marketplace deals and guaranteed programmatic buys, especially as more connected TV inventory comes on board, said LiveRamp’s Travis Clinger. Consolidation could benefit brands and publishers as it reduces fees and the costs of operating, but the reduction of consumer choice has caused the space to face antitrust issues. Google is expected to learn the fate of its ad-tech antitrust case this year, and while it appears that it will not face more dramatic structural remedies, any decision could cause a surge in ad-tech M&A, explained Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester. “Google's competitors aren't going to let an opportunity pass them by to take advantage of any weakening of Google's position in the ad tech market,” Mitchell-Wolf said. “I do anticipate the rest of the ad tech market trying to shore up their offerings, just to prepare and posture themselves to have the maximally enticing place to land for any advertisers or publishers that take a look at what Google is offering on the tail end of this.” Though the oldest members of Gen Alpha will be turning only 16 in 2026, the generation is already making waves. The cohort already wields $28 billion in direct spending power, and its influence can be seen within the marketing strategies of brands ranging from Lowe’s to Hi-Chew. In 2026, advertiser interest in Gen Alpha, or those born between 2010 and 2024, will become more concrete, according to GWI Chief Operating Officer Misha Williams. “Thinking about [Gen Alpha] in terms of an afterthought or a demographic not to be considered when you are shaping your brand positioning … is a mistake,” said Williams. While the older end of Gen Alpha is beginning to make purchases for themselves, the cohort holds significant sway over purchases made by their parents and has already established awareness for hundreds of brands. The group is also being raised in the age of social media algorithms and AI, priming them to expect deeper personalization from brands compared to previous generations, Williams explained. “With access to information, people become more aware of what they like, what they don’t like,” Williams said. “So when you’re talking about Gen Alpha and the fact that they’re so young, a critical mistake is to treat them as such.” Brands targeting Gen Alpha should expect media consumption behavior that’s even more fragmented than their Gen Z predecessors, Williams said. The cohort is also more inclined to lean on their social connections to validate whether or not a brand or product aligns with their lifestyle, making it critical for marketers to find an authentic value proposition. “What you’re putting in front of them, from an advertising and marketing perspective, must be authentic,” Williams said. “It has to resonate with them contextually.” "It’s not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult." Dipanjan Chatterjee Vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Social media and creator-led marketing surged in 2025 as giants like PepsiCo and Unilever evolved how they work with agencies and dramatically boosted their investments, a signal of the growing role both channels play in shaping culture. Interest is expected to grow in 2026, with creator ad spend in the U.S. forecast to climb 18% year over year, per the IAB. The bet is a signal that marketers have begun to value community over reach, according to Movers+Shakers Chief Creative Officer Geoffrey Goldberg. Brands will likely direct much of their budgets to smaller creators this year, Goldberg forecasts, noting that AI could help streamline the process by helping marketers scale content volume and better understand target audiences. However, category interest is bound to emphasize growing pains. For example, a rise in AI content on social feeds will likely pressure creators to strengthen their creative muscles to cut through the noise. “Already, the amplification of content and the different styles of content has upped so much because of AI … there’s a lot more people in the playing field,” Goldberg said. “The algorithms are still prioritizing great content, it’s prioritizing that over followers.” A surge in content could see both social media teams and consumers faced with burnout as more brands opt for always-on strategies. Broadly, as social media becomes a more foundational aspect of marketers’ playbooks, concerns around a lack of measurement standardization will only grow, a challenge Goldberg recommends brands approach by prioritizing metrics that prove engagement. “In order for [social] to really be their operating system, we need to be really clear on how we measure success and there’s no singular, clear metric,” Goldberg said. Sports marketing will be a major avenue for marketers looking to reach consumers in an increasingly fractured advertising landscape in 2026. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2026 Winter Olympic Games will deliver captive linear TV audiences while emerging sports and leagues create avenues for marketers to connect with more niche, but growing, consumer groups. “One of the things we're seeing is a really incredible momentum behind a lot of small, micro leagues from a familiarity perspective. They’re not super well known yet, but of the people who are aware of them, they have just incredible momentum. They're personally relevant, culturally relevant. They're really sort of poised to take off,” said Jennifer Musil, global president of research at The Harris Poll. Women’s sports will continue to gain momentum in 2026, especially as more niche sports and leagues become more popular. For example, upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled signed Maker’s Mark, a Beam Suntory Brand, as its first-ever official spirits partner in December. Women’s sports leagues give small and large brands alike an opportunity to get in early as audiences continue to grow. “Seven of the top 10 leagues in the last data set we looked at from a momentum perspective, are female leagues. So women's sports still has a ton of momentum behind it. It's not done growing yet,” said Musil. Tariffs chaos and confusion will not be left behind in 2025, but will continue to cause issues for marketers and consumers alike in 2026. Economic concerns, such as increased cost of living and inflation, may only exacerbate the issue. While the advertising industry has remained remarkably resilient in the face of tariffs and global ad revenue is expected to climb 8.8% in 2026, the Trump administration’s approach to international trade is expected to still create stress for adland. The on-and-off-again nature of tariffs and the steady rise in prices of imported goods makes it difficult for consumers to create and stick to a budget, which may translate to less discretionary spending. “CMOs are marketing to the end consumer. What is going on with tariffs is exceptionally chaotic because it makes it impossible for consumers to be able to plan their own budgets…because there is complete turbulence as it relates to tariffs," said Mike Proulx, vice president, research director, Forrester. Ultimately, marketers will have to adapt their strategies to better handle uncertainty. This could mean shorter campaigns and quicker turnaround times and an increased focus on value. As consumers tighten their purse strings, putting an emphasis on value and deals could help mitigate some of the chaos of the current economic landscape. This was already a major focus for advertisers in 2025 and could continue to be a viable strategy for 2026. “Over the last couple of years, marketers have gotten used to planning in an environment of considerable volatility. In reality, you can't plan for anything, yet you have to plan,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president, principal analyst, Forrester. “It's not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts The decision to not move forward with an opt-out option arose out of an “evolution” of the industry and regulatory environments, said a Google official.
