It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position. But now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year. Zuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion. This places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we’re going to win,” Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. “We’re going to build a better product than everyone else because we’re going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.” Read more from Fortune –Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees –In comments reigniting Tim Cook feud, Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple –LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI. Here’s how to stop it –Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls –Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla says AI will handle 80% of work in 80% of jobs While Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday. Zuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year. “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2. While AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant. “This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: About 40% Of Jobs In U.S. Book Publishing Have Disappeared Since 1997

After a year when publishing industry layoffs have frequently been in the headlines, it will surprise no one that the total number of jobs in the industry is in decline. But in an era marked by corporate consolidation, increased competition for consumer attention, and the emergence of alternative publishing models, the most recent government data suggests the loss of publishing jobs over the past three decades has been dramatic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people employed in book publishing in the United States fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. The BLS stats are drawn from detailed employment data for book publishers, which, according to the agency, includes businesses that “carry out design, editing, and marketing activities necessary for producing and distributing books,” whether “in print, electronic, or audio form.” In 1990, the BLS recorded total book publishing employment at 85,800. Employment then peaked at 91,100 in June 1997, and was at 84,600 as late as December 2008. But the number of industry jobs appears not to have rebounded from the retooling that followed the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In 2012, employment had dropped to roughly 70,000, and in 2016 to approximately 60,000. The annual average bottomed out in 2021 at 51,161, down an eye-opening 44% from the BLS’s peak. In 2023—the most recent stats, released last month—employment has rebounded slightly, to 54,822. Notably, about 20% of publishing industry employment in 2016—10,269 jobs—was in New York City. In 2023, that number had slipped to 9,540, or about 17.4% of the publishing workforce. While government figures show that full-time employment in book publishing has been in decline since the 1990s, context is key. There have been significant shifts, including new technology and consolidation, that make it difficult to compare today’s publishing industry to the industry that existed three decades ago. For example, a 1992 report produced by Simba Information listed 20 companies across all publishing segments with sales of at least $200 million. Of those 20 publishers, 10 exist today, having swallowed up the other 10. And with every acquisition comes integration and a consequent net loss of jobs as companies improve their operating efficiencies. Indeed, publishing has become more efficient in the digital age. After all, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are still growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation, and even in absolute terms it appears to be slowing. During the 1990s, for example, sales growth in publishing exceeded 5% annually. By the early 2000s, it had slowed to about 1.5% per year and hit $25 billion in 2007, according to data from the Association of American Publishers. Meanwhile, the most recent AAP numbers show sales in 2023 were $29.9 billion. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have ticked up modestly. Certainly, profitability has improved. At the 2022 U.S. Book Show, Morgan Entrekin, longtime head of Grove Atlantic, pointed to the growing pressure on publishers—especially publicly traded ones—to deliver higher margins. “In 46 years, [trade book publishers have] never seen these levels of profitability,” he said, noting that historically, profit margins in the 5% range were seen as a healthy return. Today, the four of the Big Five trade publishers that report their financial results (next year it will be three with S&S now private) typically have margins above 10%. Traditional publishing has also ceded territory to new models. For example, digital self-publishing began to make its presence felt around 2007 with the launch of Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. According to Bowker, in 2021 the number of self-published books—including e-books, print books, and digital audio—jumped to nearly three million, from just over 500,000 in 2011. Of course, self-publishing sales data is scarcer and more unreliable than data for the traditional publishing industry. Amazon recently revealed that in the 10 years Kindle Unlimited has been active, KDP authors have earned more than $3.5 billion in royalties, with more than $650 million of that coming in just the past 12 months. When you add in à la carte sales of self-published print and e-books by KDP authors as well as sales from other players in the self-publishing field, total self-publishing sales could be well north of $3 billion annually. But how many people would say they are employed in self-publishing? More to the point, where do they factor into publishing industry statistics? Few self-published authors are in the game full-time. And it is unlikely in any case that Amazon and the myriad other self-publishing companies (BookBaby, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, and Lulu among them), which all run lean, have absorbed a significant number of the job losses reported by the BLS. Then there is the anecdotal evidence, which suggests that some of the “efficiency” realized by book publishers today has been achieved on the backs of staff: fewer full-time editors, designers, and production personnel, with more work shifted to the assistant level or outsourced to freelancers foreign and domestic—labor that would not be counted in the government’s statistics on publishing industry employment. With all the shifts of the past few decades, are the BLS stats an accurate portrait of the publishing industry job market? It’s hard to say. Surely no one in the industry would dispute that their ranks are shrinking, however. And what is certain is that the structure of employment in publishing has changed dramatically—a trend that is likely to continue. Loading...

Title: It's the 'year of the mandate' at offices, but hybrid and remote work aren't dying

Related Stories Amazon isn't the only major company cracking down on remote work — the tech giant joins other companies, including Citigroup, Walmart and UPS, in requiring workers to spend more time in offices in recent months. Even so, the share of people working remotely and hybrid has ticked up in the last year, while those working from an office full-time declined, according to a new report. Some 27% of workers say they work in a hybrid arrangement, up from 26% in 2023, according to a survey of 2,000 knowledge workers from Owl Labs, the video-conferencing technology maker. Another 11% say they work fully remotely, up from 7% in the last year, according to the report. The remaining 62% say they work from a physical office five days a week, down from 66% this time last year. It's "a surprise" to see remote and hybrid work increase slightly in what's shaping up to be "the year of the mandate," says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. But hybrid workers continue to face challenges in what they want versus what their employers require. Most say they prefer to be in-office three days a week (33%) followed by two (20%), but the most common in-office schedules actually require three (41%) or four (32%) days a week. Companies are also increasing their efforts to track employees' attendance during the week. Nearly half of employees say their employer has added or increased the use of employee tracking software to gather activity data in the past year. And workers say their employers are stricter about enforcing attendance policies (like being fired for noncompliance) now, compared with 2022, according to data from WFH Research. However, "the issue with strict attendance policies is that they can become unenforceable," says Jose Maria Barrero, co-founder of WFH Research and assistant professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Business School. "If employees work from home effectively, and there is no real reason for them to come into the office other than 'it is just the policy,' will managers really punish them?" he says. "Are you willing to piss off a good employee and potentially push them to find a different job if their work is otherwise up to standard?" Some business leaders may create strict office policies to get people to quit and avoid layoffs, he says, "but I'm skeptical that they would take a hard line if things are working well." On the employee side, there's been "a severe backlash" to many attendance and tracking efforts, says Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry. "Employees want autonomy and feeling like they're not being micromanaged." When set up effectively, tracking policies and tools can "enhance transparency and performance," Vyas says. "But I feel like it's a bit invasive. It can actually erode trust, which is something really crucial in any workplace." In fact, 73% of professionals say employee-tracking initiatives like monitoring badge swipes and computer activity are not necessary or helpful, according to a recent Glassdoor poll of 1,400 users. However, Weishaupt expects 2025 will see a continuation of more RTO mandates, tracking software and badging enforcement, despite Owl Labs' and other data indicating that "employees want flexibility," he says. "And I think that will create a trust barrier between employers and employees." Want to master your money this fall? Sign up for CNBC's new online course.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-challenges-qualcomm-pros-cons-takeover-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-23T15:32:56Z

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/22/is-amazons-rto-mandate-a-signal-for-other-ceos-to-end-remote-work/

Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Elon Musk's X is the least-trusted Big Tech company, according to a survey — on par with the US government

Americans think Elon Musk's X is as trustworthy as the US government. And that's not a compliment. A May survey published by All About Cookies, a company promoting digital security and online privacy, asked 1,000 US adults how much they trusted Big Tech and media companies compared to their government. EMARKETER, a market research company owned by Business Insider's parent company, shared the survey data on Friday. While companies like Amazon and Google topped the list, Musk's platform came in dead last. The survey's data showed that 70% of respondents trust Amazon, 65% trust Google, and 64% trust Netflix. Only 29% trusted TikTok, which ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns. US officials worry that ByteDance shares data with the Chinese government and have demanded it divest TikTok to an American-owned company or face a nationwide ban. Even fewer — only 28% of respondents — however, trusted X, the same percentage that trusted the US government. The survey showed that 43% of respondents distrusted the US government, while 44% distrusted X. Although the survey didn't clarify why respondents ranked X last on the list, the platform has been a magnet for controversy since Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, rebranded it, and overhauled how it moderates content. Musk conducted mass layoffs after taking control of Twitter, particularly among its trust and safety team, whose numbers dwindled from about 230 employees to about 20. More trust and safety staffers were laid off the following year. Yoel Roth, once the head of the trust and safety team, resigned from the company soon after Musk's arrival. Concerns about misinformation on the social media app grew quickly after Musk's purchase, so he launched Community Notes in 2022. A 2023 Bloomberg report said it analyzed almost 400 X posts that contained false information about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, however, and found that it typically took more than seven hours for a Community Note to appear, and some took 70 hours. Musk himself has faced backlash for his own questionable posts, including in 2023 when business leaders criticized him for amplifying an antisemitic post on X. He backtracked in January during a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association, saying he was "naive" about antisemitism and is "Jewish by association." Musk is now dealing with the fallout from another X post this month after former President Donald Trump survived a second apparent assassination attempt. Musk asked in the post why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven't also faced similar threats. Musk's post immediately drew backlash for promoting political violence, prompting him to delete it and defend himself, calling it a "joke." The US Secret Service told Bloomberg News it is "aware" of Musk's post and is investigating the matter. Musk's X has also run afoul of multiple foreign governments, most recently in Brazil, where X lawyers on Friday finally capitulated to demands for stricter content moderation months after the country's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban of the platform. Representatives for X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Cory Doctorow at DEFCON: Disenshittify or Die

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Cory Doctorow, a renowned science fiction author and journalist, gave an enthralling speech at the recently concluded DEF CON. titled ‘DISENSHITTIFY OR DIE’. The word enshittification may seem alien to most people and it probably can’t be contained in a simpler definition. It is an entire process of exploiting end-users through a series of steps. Consider this: when the Internet first came into existence, the platforms were very simple. But is it the same now? A big NO, take Microsoft for example. Now, they allow you to use apps on the cloud, and track the features that are most important to you. They then take those features out of the basic package and sell them to you separately. This is called enshittification. The first step of this enshittification process starts with businesses appearing to be good to their end users. For example, Facebook shows you what you want to see, Uber charges less for cabs, and Amazon subsidizes goods and returns, and puts the best match of products at the top of the search results. However, there’s a hidden, more sinister part of stage one – locking in users. Now, there are several ways a platform can lock users in. Apple parts also use parts pairing, which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main device, so that you cannot use third-party parts to fix a broken device. Plus, every part of the device has a microscopic Apple logo, so third-party parts are subject to trademark violation. Once businesses have locked users in, they start making things worse for users and better for themselves. For instance, platforms poison their search results with ads. Let’s take Amazon for example, who sells its search results, making $38 billion every year. And this costs a ton of money for businesses. Around 45% of the price of these products goes to Amazon. As a result, businesses have to increase the prices to make up for the lost margin. But that’s not the end. Amazon has a policy called the ‘Most Favoured Nation Status’ which means that the cheapest price they offer must be matched on Amazon. So what’s the solution? Businesses raise their prices everywhere – Target, Walmart, and your local shops. Similarly, Facebook poisons your feed too. It shows you less of the content from the people you follow and more of sponsored content and boosted posts. There’s an old adage that says “If you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. However, Cory does not agree with this. Apple once offered a one-click option to opt out of app-based surveillance and 96% opted out. But now. Apple has turned on iOS spying, which collects users’ data for ad targeting with no option to opt out. So, even after paying $1,000 for the phone, you’re still the product. The same goes for Facebook’s ad business. This is the phase where businesses suck out all the utility from their products leaving users trapped. They do so through twiddling. With this, businesses alter the service backend to change its operations, costs, prices, search ranking, and other foundation aspects of the system. Digital platforms have made twiddling very easy. The same goes for YouTube videos. After spending thousands of dollars on a video, it is the algorithm that decides who watches them. In many cases, these videos don’t even reach the subscribers. However, there are some upsides to twiddling as well. Forbes’ Emily Baker White revealed that TikTok has a feature called the heating tool. When applied to a user’s account, this tool boosts videos from that particular creator, which reaches millions of users, irrespective of the recommendation algorithm. But why does TikTok do this? Let’s say TikTok wants more sports content on its platform. They randomly pick an account and heat it up so that the content gets a lot of traction. When other creators see this, they think that sports content is in trend and they start making similar content. And quite naturally, they do not get the traction similar to the first creator and they end up thinking that they’re missing something and doing TikTok wrong. The same thing goes for Uber drivers making $100,000 a year, sub-stackers rolling in dough, or Joe Rogan’s Spotify payout. The reason is pretty simple – the less value a business gives to suppliers, customers, and workers, the more value is left to be divided between the shareholders and executives. But, the real question is why NOW? Earlier there were consequences to enshittification. For example, companies like MySpace and Yahoo Search are down in the dumps, since they enshittified their products way too early. But now, there are no consequences of enshittification. Let’s explain the lack of consequences. There are four forces that discipline tech companies: Your customers should not find it easy to leave you and switch to a rival product. For example, the network effect of Facebook has prevented its users from leaving. But the main question is whether there’s an alternative. Similarly, Apple, Microsoft, and Google aren’t making things companies but buying them, which has led to a monopolistic market economy. This, in turn, has been made possible due to the government’s unexplained tolerance towards anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, predatory pricing, and market-distorting exclusivity deals, which are prohibited by antitrust laws. This has made companies too big to fail, which in turn, has made them too big to care. And once companies realize that you’ve nowhere to go and no alternative in sight, they start treating you badly. When the government stopped caring about antitrust laws, they killed all hopes of regulation. Regulation is only meaningful when the regulator is more powerful than the companies it regulates. When the companies become bigger than the government, it becomes almost impossible to regulate them, irrespective of their crimes. And this hefty risk paid off for IBM when Ronald Reagan became the President. Regan believed in a monopoly-driven economy and dropped the case on IBM. Let’s take the example of an industry where there are 100 companies, each fighting for a share of the market. These businesses are too busy thinking about snatching the food off others’ plates and poaching employees and customers. Now imagine these 100 companies merging into five giant corporations, which basically become a ‘cartel’. Now, getting a consensus becomes easier and so does capturing the regulators. This has given them the power to escape privacy or labor rights, just because they do it with an app. For example, spying on your phone activities doesn’t seem to be a privacy violation to businesses just because they do so with an app. The same goes for algorithmic wage violations. So once the competition was killed and cartels overtook regulators, there was still something that could be done – disenshittification. In the tech field, every enshittificatory alteration can be disenshittified. So, every time HP sells you expensive ink, it is inviting a third-party seller to sell a refill kit. Or when Tesla installs codes that do not let you charge your whole battery, it is inviting a competitor to sell you a jailbreaking kit. Once the customer finds ways to disenshittify the enshittified product, that customer is lost forever. This is exactly how interoperability works and is a major check on enshittification. Tech workers have always been in short supply, which gives them an upper hand. And to make these workers work crazy hours, businesses came up with a trick – vocational awe. Businesses appealed to their love for technology and managed to convince them that they were the heroes of the digital transformation. This whole vocation awe worked for a while – employees did put in some hard hours. But, it also backfired for businesses. Since the supply was still short, there was always another employer ready to pay them just as much. But eventually, supply caught up with the demand. Last year, 260,000 tech workers were fired and the businesses gained the upper hand. Businesses and bosses have always been like this. They want to charge hefty prices, while delivering the least value and share as little as possible with workers, users, suppliers, and customers. However, earlier when they tried to enshittify their business, constraints like competition, regulation, interop, and workers stopped them. But now, when all these forces have melted away, the enshittification lever is free to move. During the end of this speech, Cory called for the formation of a new good internet. But for that, the four constraints should be reinstated. The first constraint is competition. After almost 40 years of lull, antitrust is finally coming back. For example, Wiz refused to be merged with Google, which was supposed to be the largest merger in history.. New merger guidelines are being rolled out by the FTC and the DoJ. Countries like the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea are taking more antitrust action in the last 4 years than they did during the past 40 years. The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires a dominant platform to open up APIs so that third-party businesses can offer interoperable services. But that’s not the case with the DMA, it is called an ‘Act’, which means it is enforced in the EU’s federal courts and not Ireland. Even US lawmakers are working towards creating new privacy laws. There has been a movement called the Right to Repair led by the Repair Coalition. In fact, in Oregon, a state R2R bill has been passed that bans parts pairing, where DRMs prevented using new parts unless it was authorized by a technician code. Tech workers were for long made to believe that they were ‘entrepreneurs in making’. But the reality was that workers’ power was because of scarcity and when that ended, layoffs started, and workers lost their edge. The solution is simple – union. Cory referred to the Tech Workers Coalition and Tech Solidarity organization and called for tech workers to get organized. In the end, Cory stressed the fact that it is possible to create a good new internet, with the ‘technological self-determination of the old internet’. Your email address will not be published.
