World of Tanks collaboration announced. Fans eager to hear more about the next Tomb Raider game are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure. Since Shadow of the Tomb Raider wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of Netflix's animated series, as well as Brawlhalla, Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight, Magic the Gathering, Fall Guys, Pinball FX, and now even World of Tanks as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here, in my opinion the best Lara. The new trailer for World of Tanks, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game. Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games. As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series. But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider games rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around the next mainline Tomb Raider game. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well". Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics has been subject to layoffs, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time. Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider. I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.

Title: The stock market's biggest bet is setting investors up for a smackdown
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/massive-ai-investment-slowing-economy-recession-stock-market-crash-earnings-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-07-07T08:04:01Z

Wall Street really needs AI to live up to the hype. A lot has been said about the emerging technology's world-changing potential: Its ability to create stunningly realistic images and videos, ace the LSAT and the MCAT, and complete rote research tasks. You could argue it's ready to augment — or even replace — entry-level jobs. These features have investors up and down the Street very excited. Staunch supporters like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives say AI could revolutionize the human experience. Research desks from big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have given subtler nods to the prospect of AI as a productivity and profit booster, which could provide an undercurrent to stock market success over the next several years. In fact, analysts are counting on the AI mania to fuel the market even as the White House's chaotic trade policy eats into corporate America's profit potential. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to grow 8% this year, a fairly average showing for an anything-but-average year. What is notable is just how much of that growth relies on the tech sector: Silicon Valley companies are expected to boost their earnings by 21% — the highest growth of any sector. By contrast, profits for retailers are forecast to grow a measly 2.5%. Within the tech sector, semiconductor companies — one of the most globally exposed industries on the stock market — are expected to supercharge profit this year, with a projected climb of 49%. This enthusiasm is a signal Wall Street is betting that demand for AI's use cases will supersede tariff turmoil or job market wobbles. AI's growth has been incredible, and its adoption has been strong enough to leave its fingerprints on economic data sets like business investment and manufacturing spending. Yet no matter how rabid the world is about AI's possibilities, the amount that investors are relying on the tech to fuel the market's gains — especially in the face of rising economic uncertainty — feels short-sighted. Tech stocks helped the market recover from its April malaise, yet earnings expectations and economic momentum are even weaker than they were at the lowest point of the sell-off. This combination leaves the stock market in a precarious spot: Either AI needs to live up to the hype, or investors could be looking at a gnarly second half of the year. One way to tell the story of human history is through our technology — the lightbulb, the calculator, the tractor, the computer all stand as markers to our societal progress and have helped drive the level of efficiency and productivity we enjoy. Tech has perhaps played an equally prominent role in our investment portfolios. The Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are collectively worth $18 trillion, or about 33% of the S&P 500's total market value. Together, their stock prices have increased 330% over the past five years, compared with a 100% rise in the S&P 500. It makes sense. Big Tech's products have become deeply integrated into our daily lives, and that level of ubiquity has also captured Wall Street's attention. Venture capital fundraising reached a record in the first quarter amid a huge appetite for AI investment, and S&P 500 companies mentioned AI more than tariffs on second-quarter conference calls. The $65 trillion US stock market may be particularly gripped by Big Tech's ups and downs these days, but it hasn't always been this way. Tech has averaged about 20% of the S&P 500's market value over the past decade, including 13% in the five years before COVID. The dominance is not set in stone, and while the wider market's fortunes are tied to tech now, that may not always be the case. While the stock market may seem like one big proxy for the tech sector's explosive growth right now, there is one deeper connection that should draw investors' attention. Over time, the S&P 500 has been attached at the hip to the fate of the broader US economy. Eight of the past 12 market crashes — S&P drops of 20% or more — overlapped with recessions. No matter how high-flying an industry is, recessions tend to pull stock prices and business hopes back to Earth. The internet revolutionized the world in the late 1990s, and the explosion in social media dominated the 2010s, but the information sector has shed employees and seen share prices fall in the past three recessions. Given that setup, we've set the stage for a portfolio smackdown of the ages. Economists are worried a recession is coming, yet investors are surprisingly upbeat about AI's prospects — so upbeat that they've bid S&P 500 tech stocks to nearly a record high. Sell-side analysts who evaluate company-level trends are similarly optimistic. But in the real economy, layoffs are growing, and hiring has ground to a halt. The sharply diverging views between economists and stock analysts mean someone has to be wrong. The freight train that is AI adoption — a three-year story of rapid innovation and progress — could collide with a massive wall from historic tariffs, high interest rates, and low consumer confidence. What's particularly rich about this is that tech companies are the most exposed sector to global tariffs. They gather the highest percentage of revenue internationally, plus they have the most suppliers and factories outside US borders. In fact, semiconductor companies — the firms providing chips for AI technology — are expected to hit that aforementioned 49% earnings growth despite generating 67% of their revenue abroad and sourcing 70% of their supplies from overseas. Some analysts believe that if AI hopes can keep the stock market chugging along, maybe it can do the same to the economy. After all, companies invested an inflation-adjusted $2.2 trillion on computers and other processing equipment last quarter, about one-seventh of the $16 trillion Americans spent on goods and services. Investing more in AI does ultimately help boost the economy, but that $2 trillion is peanuts compared with the real engine of the US economy. Americans' spending accounts for about 70% of GDP — by far the biggest driver of output — and spending has dropped in each of the past nine recessions. If tariffs intimidate consumers and lead to layoffs that decimate American incomes, then the economy is probably bound for a crisis — whether the robots pan out or not. And based on history, an economic crisis could topple the stock market. The math shows us that AI isn't much of a match for some effects of tariffs and may not logistically be enough to save the economy from ruin. Your portfolio's outcome may be a different story, though. This is when I have to introduce you to one of the most frustrating adages of investing: The stock market is not the economy. The economy is the value that we create — the hard assets, the cash spent, the paychecks we get. Stocks are an expression of that value, but they use the present reality to project future expectations. AI's impact on the economy may not bear out through numbers. But in your portfolio, AI's influence depends on how willing we are to collectively dream up better days ahead in terms of what AI is capable of and how much money AI-dominant firms will amass in the years to come. Dreaming is already a big part of the AI trade. S&P 500 tech companies' estimated earnings grew about 50% in 2023 and 2024, yet their share prices jumped 112%. Nothing is cut-and-dried when it comes to the stock market. It is the ultimate tangled web of logic, psychology, and mixed incentives. The stock market's future depends on investors' ability to dream, and people are willing to dream when they feel confident in the present moment. The problem is, investors are awfully confident about tech stocks right now. S&P 500 tech companies made up about 23% of total index profits in the first quarter, yet their shares account for 32% of the S&P 500's value. To close that gap, tech profits would have to grow 40%, or tech stocks would have to drop 29% from their end-of-June levels. Stocks can thrive when expectations are higher than reality, but in these conditions, they require reasons to stay hopeful. The problem arises when investors aren't willing to dream. When they're too focused on present issues to give compelling stories the benefit of the doubt. Or in big market drops, crushed by financial strain. Then, the numbers matter. People claw for any concrete evidence of AI's value. They demand proof of profits, even though companies are spending money on a pivot to the next big thing. Stock prices adjust, and if you hold a swath of US stocks or index funds, your money is probably heavily exposed to this reality check. This is what happened in 2000. Investors were willing to dream about this brave new technology called the World Wide Web until interest rates climbed too high and the reality of how much computing was needed for Y2K was found to be way overblown. Suddenly, the dream died, and tech stock prices came back down to reality. These days, we all know that dream wasn't completely off base. Yet share prices took an 80% crash before the promise of the new tech came to fruition. This is what I worry about the most in the clash between AI and the economy. We're somewhere between AI saving the world and being an overhyped bust of a technology that can be ripped off by another country. I'm not foolish enough to call this a bubble, and I think AI will eventually deliver benefits for our economy. We're not there yet, though, even though investors like to think so. It takes years for big technological trends to take hold, and productivity usually shines through when workers feel empowered and companies feel comfortable expanding. That's far from the case right now — business confidence is in the dumps, so we're in the opposite scenario. When the economy is getting weaker, it's best to grasp onto what's real in your portfolio. And there's a striking gap between AI and reality.

Title: Microsoft Washes Its Hands Of Ad Tech; Google’s Network To Get Work

Call It ‘Don’t Invest’ Microsoft is undergoing its second round of massive layoffs in as many months, Bloomberg reports. The details on the latest round are still unknown, but Microsoft Advertising was keenly affected by layoffs in May, which fell hardest on legacy product and engineering roles. But regardless of how the latest layoffs play out, Microsoft is clearly deprioritizing – if not wholesale abandoning – much of its third-party ad tech: i.e., former AppNexus products, a publisher ad server and PromoteIQ, its retail media acquisition. Microsoft is also calling it quits on Invest, the one-time AppNexus DSP, which is shutting down in early 2026. PromoteIQ went the way of the dodo last year. Having had a taste of third-party programmatic tech, Microsoft appears to be spitting most of it back out after extracting the bits it still finds valuable. Yet Microsoft Advertising says it remains “committed to our end-to-end platforms that help our clients reach the audiences they need wherever they are across the open web,” a spokesperson told AdExchanger in 2023 for a story about a reorg related to the former AppNexus. “Nothing has changed here,” they added. (Okay.) After those statements were made, it would be just another 18 months before Microsoft’s DSP was given its notice of pending termination. Google’s Pub Crawl Google wants to get back into the good graces of publishers, which isn’t easy, considering Google’s AI searches are siphoning their traffic. Oh, and not to mention a landmark antitrust case regarding Google’s sell-side ad tech. But Google is now growing its sell-side ad tech enterprise sales teams, The Information reports. Google Ad Manager’s (GAM) clientele indexes to smaller businesses that are typically less willing to pay ad premiums, which means publishers get relatively lower rates via GAM. One publisher saw “a lower percentage of revenue coming from Google’s advertising technology tools than they did three years ago,” according to The Information. Google’s ad network, which encompasses GAM and accounts for money paid out to publishers, has been declining for years, even as Google’s overall revenue has skyrocketed. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, Google announced a new paywall product called Offerwall that gives readers a variety of options to access articles, such as paying a one-time fee or watching an ad. Perhaps Google is shining its sell-side business in advance of a potential forced divestiture, speculates The Information. Or Google could genuinely see a need to shore up its sell-side ad tech due to market share gains by vendors like PubMatic, Magnite and Amazon. Regardless, Google has a steep mountain to climb if it wants to regain its standing with publishers. Meta-Friendship Meta has been quietly developing chatbots that proactively engage with users, Business Insider reports. The goal, per documentation from Alignerr, the AI chatbot vendor working with Meta on the project, is to “provide value for users and ultimately help to improve re-engagement and user retention.” For creators, the chatbots could respond to comments and fans on their behalf. For brands, it’s an organic way to retarget people. And users might turn to specialized chatbots for recipe ideas, say, or music recommendations. Meta already laid out its vision of a future where AI chatbots populate its platform indistinguishably from real people. Mark Zuckerberg frames this work as a potential fix for the “loneliness epidemic” afflicting Meta users and people in general. It hasn’t been smooth sailing, though. Earlier this year, Meta had to frantically delete its first AI chatbot friends, which came off as painfully cringe to actual humans.

Title: After a Year of High-stakes Financing, Saks Turns Back to High-stakes Retailing

Time Published: 2025-07-07T04:01:00Z

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The luxury department store has access to the funds it needs to operate now; the question is how well it will square up to a tough retail market. Deputy Managing Editor The year since Saks and Neiman Marcus Group cut their landmark $2.7 billion deal has been dominated not by talk of a new luxury retail giant or a modern merchant force taking shape. Instead, it’s been all about the rough and tumble of high-stakes corporate finance. On that score, it’s been a story of quick and agile dealmaking that would be surprising or just unbelievable from almost anyone else but Richard Baker, executive chairman of what is now Saks Global. Related Articles Fashion Features From Sex Clubs to Castles, Latex to Upcycling, Berlin Fashion Week Had Something for Everyone Retail Saks Global Bolsters Its Finances, Secures $600 Million in Commitments Consider this: You May Also Like And then things really got started. Hudson’s Bay was spun off and went bankrupt, Saks and Neiman’s vendors were thrown into a tailspin by a yearlong schedule to repay past due bills and 90-day payment terms on all shipments going forward. And bondholders — some of whom seem to haven’t bothered to read some very important fine print — revolted when they learned their debt wasn’t directly secured by the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship. Saks then lined up $350 million in new financing in May only to ditch that in favor of $600 million in financing last month from a group of bondholders jockeying for a better position in the capital structure. From the outside, the company has appeared to be lurching from one crisis to the next. And from the inside, it’s seemingly been a nightmare. But last week, new money in hand, Saks made a crucial $120 million interest payment on the bonds. It’s said to be paying vendors on time under the new terms and Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, has even floated the possibility of making back payments earlier than planned. “As we progress over the next few months, if we see a return to what we believe to be normalized receipt flow, we plan to evaluate the possibility of accelerating the timeline to pay back past due balances to our brand partners,” Metrick told vendors in a memo last month that was obtained by WWD. At least for now, the Saks story is no longer a tale about financing. Everyone inside and out agrees that Saks has the money to get through this year and sources close to the company maintain that it has the financial wherewithal to last much longer even if Christmas doesn’t turn out to be a blockbuster season. One source said Saks’ outside auditors gave the company a clean bill of health — good for at least a year — after the $350 million in financing was lined up and now that’s been upsized to a potential total of $600 million, giving it even more cushion. Right now, the future of Saks is not about its ability to wrangle investors or lenders, but the company’s retail savvy and its ability to push what Metrick has called a “reset” of luxury retail through an increasingly complicated retail market. “All we heard about is ‘We’re running out of money,'” said Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, summing up the bondholder take on the company. “’We need money for inventory, we need money to make interest payments.’ Money, money, money. So OK, we got you set up, you told us you needed this much money, now you show us that you know what to buy and you bought the right inventory and you know how to sell it to make a reasonable profit.” That’s the trick in retail anyway — and one that requires finesse in good times and real skill in tough ones, like now when consumers are skittish and President Donald Trump’s trade war is still disrupting supply. Big retail mergers are dicey to start with. “Now, they have control of the best high-end retailers,” Hynes said. “In theory it should work out. Nobody’s going to open a new high-end retailer tomorrow. It’s just not going to happen. So they got the market cornered. In theory, if anything’s going to work, this should work. Everybody says, ‘Rich people always have money, this should work out.’ However, if you look at history, combining retailers has never worked out.” That point could be argued, kind of — the Federated-May mega merger worked for a time and changed the retail landscape, but that company, now Macy’s Inc., is now morphing again for a new age. But nobody argues that Saks is working in a tough space. “Department stores are not the best neighborhood to be operating in,” said Mickey Chadha, the Moody’s Investors Service debt analyst who follows Saks. “They’re relying on cost cuts, layoffs, efficiencies between the two companies,” Chadha said. “And that’s all great. If you can accomplish that, you’re definitely better for your bottom line. However, you have to grow, you have to grow. And their sales have been declining quite dramatically in the last couple of years. So if you don’t grow, there’s only so much you can do in synergies and cost cuts. “This $600 million of new monies that we’re talking about is great,” he said. “It gives them more runway to get the ship back on course. But it’s not going to be the end all. If they continue to burn cash, that $600 million will then disappear again in the next 12 months, and then they’ll need more capital. The holiday is going to be key for them.” Holiday, next year and beyond relies not on raising more money or courting investors, but on making the big Saks reset work. It’s a complicated bit of work for Metrick. Saks Global is combining operations for the two nameplates, reestablishing trust with vendors, cementing the new payment terms, expanding through a luxury shop on Amazon and looking at brands in new ways with its Authentic Luxury Group joint venture. Somewhere in there could be a bright future for the idea of the luxury department store, which has suffered blow after blow since the bankruptcy of Barneys New York in 2019. There is no shortage of brands with real gripes against Saks as it just now starts paying bills due years ago. But some luxury labels are also sensing new potential ahead — and brands both large and small say Saks Global is vital to their businesses and its survival is key. One adviser to independent designer brands said they are getting more excited about Saks’ shop on Amazon, which launched with 50 brands and is said to be bringing new shoppers into the business. “Are we going to actually see more sales through e-commerce than we’re seeing in the physical stores?” the adviser wondered. “How does the retail footprint shrink or change?” That refocuses the narrative around Saks back to where it really should be — its retail fortunes.

Title: The Broken Microsoft Pact: Layoffs and Performance Management
URL: https://danielsada.tech/blog/microsoft-pact/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T22:54:21Z
Full Content:
When you join Microsoft, you hear stories about people who’ve been there for 20 years, who grew up with the company, who never had to worry about sudden changes (maybe except for 2008). The performance management system had its quirks, but there was an understanding that if you did solid work, you’d have a place. But something shifted. Maybe it was the market, maybe it was the pressure to stay competitive with companies that move faster and pay more. The implicit agreement that made lower compensation feel acceptable started to crack. For decades, Microsoft operated under an unspoken agreement with its employees—what I call “the pact.” The deal was simple: We’ll pay you 20-50% below market rate, but in exchange, you get stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs. This wasn’t written in any employee handbook, but everyone understood it. It was the Microsoft way. For many strong performing engineers, this was an attractive trade-off. You might not get rich as quickly as your friends at startups, but you could plan your life around stability. You could get a mortgage, start a family, and sleep well knowing your job wasn’t going anywhere. According to layoffs.fyi, Microsoft has laid off around 30,000 people in the last two years. To put this in context: that’s roughly 13% of Microsoft’s workforce, and while the entire tech industry saw significant layoffs (Meta, Google, Amazon all made major cuts), Microsoft’s situation stands out because of their historical commitment to employment stability. Many people are confused about this departure from Microsoft’s traditional approach. As a former employee, I want to share my perspective on why this shift was almost expected. While economic factors certainly contributed, Microsoft’s performance management challenges made layoffs a more attractive option than addressing individual performance issues systematically. Microsoft’s performance management has always been atrocious on both sides of the ruthlessness/leniency scale. In the Ballmer era, the forced stack ranking of employees. Essentially a system where managers had to grade their teams on a curve, with a predetermined percentage forced into “underperforming” categories regardless of actual performance, caused people to live in this fear environment. Even if you had a team of stellar performers, someone had to be labeled as bottom 10%. This led to internal competition, backstabbing, and people gaming the system by avoiding high-performing teams or sabotaging colleagues. This caused great attrition and unfavorable business outcomes for Microsoft. The system was so universally hated that when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, eliminating stack ranking was one of his first major moves. The opposite became true: it seems managers had to fight HR to get someone on their team out. I personally saw the bad side of this. I had a co-worker who had no productive outcomes for a year, and it took a year of continued documentation to get him fired. This also caused a downstream effect on team morale, as he was still getting rewards and a salary similar to other people. Sadly, one of the tradeoffs you have to understand is that at the same level, over the same year, the difference in pay between someone at the highest level of performance versus someone who passably does their job does not create enough differentiation for most levels lower than principal, barring random exceptional one-off stock grants (which also don’t help retention, due to their randomness). This causes the system to not be a meritocracy, with “passing by” being the default. I’ll acknowledge upfront that Microsoft is a massive, diverse company with thousands of managers and teams. My experiences reflect specific orgs, specific timeframes (2016-2022), and specific leadership chains. Your mileage may vary dramatically depending on your team, your manager, and your timing. I recognize that some teams and managers at Microsoft do provide strong performance differentiation, meaningful career growth, and excellent employee experiences. However, these patterns were consistent enough across my tenure, conversations with colleagues from different orgs, and observations of broader company trends that I believe they represent systemic issues rather than isolated incidents. The goal isn’t to dismiss positive experiences but to highlight structural challenges that affect enough employees to warrant discussion. For me, coming from outside the US where employment contracts offer significantly more protection, at-will employment was a jarring concept. In most countries, terminating an employee requires cause, documentation, and often significant severance payments. Employment contracts typically specify notice periods — sometimes months — giving both parties time to plan transitions. At-will employment means your employer can terminate you for any reason (or no reason) at any time, as long as it’s not discriminatory. No advance notice required. No severance guaranteed. One day you’re planning your next sprint, the next day you’re cleaning out your desk. This reality requires a completely different approach to financial and mental planning. You can’t just budget for your monthly expenses, you need to maintain an emergency fund that can cover 6+ months of unemployment. You can’t get too comfortable or assume job security based on performance alone. You need to constantly network, keep your resume updated, and maintain relationships outside your current company. Here’s where at-will employment creates a perverse incentive structure that helps explain Microsoft’s recent layoff approach. While you can fire someone for any reason, firing individual employees for performance still carries significant legal risk and administrative burden. To fire someone for performance, managers must document everything meticulously. Every missed deadline, every subpar deliverable, every coaching conversation needs to be recorded. HR requires a paper trail that can withstand legal scrutiny. This process can take months or even years, during which the underperforming employee continues to collect their salary and potentially drag down team morale. The legal risk is real. Even in at-will states, wrongful termination lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming. Companies worry about discrimination claims, especially if the fired employee belongs to a protected class. Better to have an ironclad documentation trail than face a costly legal battle. Layoffs, paradoxically, are “cleaner.” When you eliminate entire roles or teams, you sidestep the performance documentation requirements. You’re not firing someone for being bad at their job, you’re eliminating the job itself. The legal risk is minimal, and you can even look compassionate by offering severance packages and transition support. Employees can even claim unemployment and keep their income for months! For VPs and executives, layoffs solve multiple problems at once: they can eliminate underperformers without the messy documentation process, reduce headcount to hit financial targets, and maintain the narrative that they’re making “tough but strategic decisions” rather than admitting they failed to manage performance effectively. The bitter irony? Getting laid off is often better for the employee than being fired. Layoffs typically come with severance, extended healthcare, and the ability to say you were “affected by restructuring” rather than “terminated for cause.” You get more time to find your next job, and your professional reputation remains intact. This creates a system where companies find it easier to fire good employees in bulk than to fire bad employees individually. The legal protections meant to prevent arbitrary termination end up enabling exactly that, just at scale. For visa workers, the math is even more stark. When fired for performance, H-1B and other visa holders typically have just 60 days to find new employment or leave the country. But when laid off, they get severance time plus the 60-day grace period, often giving them 3-6 months to secure new sponsorship. For someone whose legal status depends on employment, layoffs are significantly more humane than performance-based termination. The AI efficiency narrative provides the perfect cover for these layoffs. Companies can frame headcount reduction as “leveraging AI to increase productivity” or “optimizing for the future of work.” It sounds forward-thinking and strategic rather than admitting they failed to manage performance or simply want to cut costs. Whether AI actually replaces the laid-off workers’ productivity is rarely measured or proven, but the narrative sells well to investors and the media. The pact is fundamentally broken. Instead, a new pact has been formed: Rather than prescribing what people should do, I think it’s worth understanding the game theory at play. If exceptional performance only nets a negliglible level of improvement while layoff risk remains constant, rational actors might consider: Focus energy strategically. When reward differentiation is minimal, investing extra energy in building external networks and transferable skills may provide better long-term returns than purely internal recognition. Maintain financial cushions. Regardless of performance level, keep emergency funds for unexpected transitions. Keep options open. Whether this means networking, skill development, or periodic market checks depends on your personal risk tolerance and career goals. The optimal approach depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and what you value in a career. The Microsoft I joined no longer exists today.. The implicit contract that made lower compensation tolerable — stability and job security — has been broken. What remains is a company that pays below market rate while offering the same job insecurity as anywhere else. For current and prospective Microsoft employees, understanding this new reality is crucial. The company still offers excellent benefits, interesting technical challenges, and the prestige of working at a tech giant. But the days of trading pay for security are over. Would I return to Microsoft knowing what I know now? Maybe. But it would be with a completely different mindset than my first time around. I’d go in understanding that it’s a traditional job with traditional job insecurity, not the stable career haven I once believed it to be. I’d negotiate harder on compensation, knowing there’s no stability premium to justify below-market pay. And I’d never again make the mistake of believing that good performance alone guarantees job security. The Microsoft of today can still be a great place to work, if you go in with realistic expectations and plan accordingly. I want to be clear about something: I’m not bitter about my time at Microsoft. I learned enormously, worked on products used by millions, built lasting relationships, and gained experience that directly contributed to my current success. Microsoft gave me opportunities I’m genuinely grateful for, and I have tremendous respect and admiration for many of the people I worked with there. This analysis isn’t about personal grievances. It’s about a structural shift that affects how people should think about employment decisions. The same way you’d analyze any investment or major life choice, understanding the changing risk/reward profile at Microsoft (or any company) is just rational decision-making. Many people thrive at Microsoft today and will continue to do so. The goal isn’t to discourage anyone from working there, but to help people make informed decisions based on the current reality rather than outdated assumptions about job security.

Pluribus Unum Workers are anxious that artificial intelligence could wipe out their jobs as layoffs continue and employers are cautious about hiring. Tech executives, economists and other experts say that AI could automate mundane and tedious tasks and also create new roles. Tech companies that are cutting jobs and leaning more on artificial intelligence are also disrupting themselves.Amazon’s Chief Executive Andy Jassy said last month that he expects the e-commerce giant will shrink its workforce as employees “get efficiency gains from using AI extensively.”At Salesforce, a software company that helps businesses manage customer relationships, Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week that AI is already doing 30% to 50% of the company’s work.Other tech leaders have chimed in before. Earlier this year, Anthropic, an AI startup, flashed a big warning: AI could wipe out more than half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.Ready or not, AI is reshaping, displacing and creating new roles as technology’s impact on the job market ripples across multiple sectors. The AI frenzy has fueled a lot of anxiety from workers who fear their jobs could be automated. Roughly half of U.S. workers are worried about how AI may be used in the workplace in the future and few think AI will lead to more job opportunities in the long run, according to a Pew Research Center report.The heightened fear comes as major tech companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, Amazon and Meta cut workers, push for more efficiency and promote their AI tools.

Title: CEOs Say AI Is Poised to Wipe Out an Astonishing Number of Jobs

Billionaire tech moguls aren't the only ones doomsaying about artificial intelligence layoffs. CEOs across a range of industries are now jumping on the bandwagon, saying it's no longer a matter of "if," but "how many" jobs AI will take. A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal explored just how pervasive the automation idea is throughout a number of industries, and execs aren't pulling any punches. For example, CEO of Ford Motor Company Jim Farley recently predicted that AI "is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the US." He added that "AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind." In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spooked his employees with a memo saying to expect layoffs in the next few years because of the "once-in-a-lifetime" revolution of AI. And at JPMorgan Chase, CEO Marianne Lake recently told investors to expect the company's overall head count — and therefore its payroll expenses — to fall by as much as 10 percent over the next few years, thanks to the magic of AI. If the AI automation dystopia really is upon us, it evidently slipped under the radar of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recently released its latest jobs report. Among other things, it found that the US added 147,000 jobs in June, slightly dropping the unemployment rate from 4.2 percent to 4.1 — and seemingly refuting the claim of an impending AI takeover, at least for now. Over half of these jobs, NBC notes, were in state and local government roles, while healthcare, social, service, and construction work made up the bulk of other gains. Still, there are some major issues buried in the data, like the fact that long-term unemployment — people unemployed for six months or more — has skyrocketed from 190,000 to a whopping 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of people unemployed at the median length of unemployment, 15 weeks or more, jumped from 34.9 percent to 38.3 percent. That level hasn't been seen since the throes of the pandemic, NBC notes. While those numbers are bad news — like, really bad — the crisis they point to is a little more complicated than an AI-powered dystopia. At their core, these numbers are arguably the result of our economy's dependence on unemployment laundered through AI hype. As economic researchers Jeffrey Funk and Gary Smith observed in a recent column, revenue from large language model (LLM) adoption is falling far short of the tech industry's promises. What gets presented as proof of AI's automation potential is instead a mash of penny-pinching layoffs, outsourcing, labor market saturation, and in some cases, employer bias against recent college grads. With that view in mind, all the CEO bluster looks less like an imminent crisis brought on by AI, and more like business as usual in a market economy. What workers do about that whole situation is another story altogether.

Title: One of America's most important companies slashes 20,000 jobs and offers huge buyouts

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 5:44:20 AM PDT by DFG UPS is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time US drivers following its decision to slash 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities. The Atlanta-based company will be providing its laid off employees with various benefits, including pensions and healthcare. The layoffs are part of UPS's network configuration plan, which also confirms the upcoming closures of over 90 more facilities in the future. The changes are part of the company's $3.5 billion cost reduction target for 2025, aiming to reach a 12 percent US operational margin by next year. UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Many, many years ago, like almost 60 years, I worked at a place that got deliveries and shipped stuff as well. Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then. Well, a few years later, he was out of a job, and the company he worked for was out of business. That company was known as REA… Railroad Express Agency. I think there is a lesson there. 20 posted on 07/04/2025 7:59:33 AM PDT by Ditto [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

(Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ... “providing its laid off employees with various benefits, including pensions and healthcare” I’ve known a few delivery guys over the years....all say the same thing, since the 90s the relationship between management and labor has been contentious at best. In light of that, if it were me, those that can go should. They can always hire on with usps and do half the work for probably comparable pay. It sounds like the Teamsters hired a bunch of district court judges: “Young cannot do that!” Amazon deliveries are more reliable than UPS. My Prime shipments always get to me when Amazon delivers. FedEX and UPS are a mixed bag. The issue is a mix of 4 things - package theft, driver malfeasance or incompetence and shipper fraud. By delivering its own packages, Amazon has a handle on all four. When is Trump going to start laying off and deporting all these “dipstick rogue judges”? They are a bunch of out of control fascists that need to be gone. Why in the hell does America need 674 of these tyrannical, fascist slobs that know nothing about the law and the Constitution and have turned into the DemonRAT Party’s Gestapo? Da weaponized “judges” have got to go. All of them! They are in the same business as the post office and in the 90’s people started ‘going postal’. My company-different business- went in the same direction. It starts when being overwhelmed with work. UPS-perhaps automation is part of the downsizing. Throw in Amazon and Walmart deliveries. That's because most management sucks the ass of the owners or administrators. I worked for NY State. The higher positions in the department I worked in were political appointments. Those people had friends in high positions in Albany that gave them their jobs, and took care of them. If they wanted to keep their job, they danced to the tune of Albany. In 25 years, I never met one that was worth the powder to blow them up. Remember, if it ain’t selling, it’s ain’t moving……. Freight companies are the first to see a slow down and first to sell a pick up…. Quick! Somebody call the miniature “dipstick judges’ to pull these employees ‘nads out of the fire! They needs some “injunktions” right away! Does Trump have that authority? I thought only Congress could do anything and that would be by shutting down their funding dumping amazon biz had zero to do with tariffs ... but hey, gotta get a dig in at tariffs if you’re any kind of decent anti-trump propaganda rag ... besides, i thought climate change caused UPS to dump amazon business ... silly me ... Both of my sons are drivers for FedEx. I wonder if this portends anything for them. FedEX is better any way thay don’t have a 50lb limit on shipments. UPS has almost 500,000 employees. 20,000 is about 4%. They can achieve that through normal attrition. Sounds like a plan to dump employees making good money and replace them with fresh employees at 1/2 the price. I don’t think UPS is one of our most important companies. For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Plus of course they suck so much to deal with their biggest customer of the past (Amazon) decided to go ahead and do it themselves. And other companies are following that path. So UPS can get in trouble and not have it mean anything. THAT STATEMENT IS THE SAME OLD “UNION”LINE I LIVE RURAL THE UPS TRUCK GOES UP & DOWN THE GRAVEL ROAD ON MY EASTERN PARCEL BOUNDARY.

Title: Fears of an AI workforce takeover may be overblown — but it's still scrambling firms' hiring plans

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing chorus of executives has put white collar workforces on notice: Their jobs are at risk of being wiped out by artificial intelligence. Yet above that din is a more complicated picture of how AI is currently affecting hiring. Direct evidence of an acceleration in human obsolescence remains scant so far. In a report this week, the job and hiring consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said cuts spurred by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency remained the leading cause of job losses — especially for government, nonprofit and other sectors supported by federal funds — followed by general economic and market conditions. Out of 286,679 planned layoffs so far this year, only 20,000 were linked to automation, the firm said — with just 75 explicitly tied to AI implementation. “Far less is happening than people imagine,” said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the consultancy, referring to the impact of AI on the broader workforce in the U.S. “There are roles that can be significantly changed by AI right now, but I’m not talking to too many HR leaders who say AI is replacing jobs.” That belies recent comments made by some of America’s most prominent executives about the impact that artificial intelligence is expected to have. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned that AI would “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. However, he did not lay out what that time frame might look like. He also said more people would likely be needed to do “other types of jobs,” ones that AI may help generate. And while The Wall Street Journal reported comments from Ford CEO Jim Farley this week that AI would replace “literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.,” a clip of Farley’s presentation offered more context. The automotive executive was speaking about beefing up America’s blue-collar workforce, and appeared to be repeating the warning about a white-collar wipeout issued by the CEO of the AI company Anthropic — a contention that is still being debated. (A representative for Ford did not respond to a request for comment.) Experts say the current era of AI is affecting the job market in more roundabout ways. Many firms are currently under tremendous pressure to cut costs given the generally uncertain economic environment spurred by the heavy cost of Trump’s tariff policy and worries about rising inflation. As a result, some companies are diverting spending that would otherwise be going to hiring more employees and shifting it toward AI software. “There’s basically a blank check to go out and buy these AI tools,” said Josh Bersin, CEO of The Josh Bersin Company workforce consultancy. “Then they go out and say, as far as head count: No more hiring. Just, ‘stop.’ So that immediately freezes the job market.” Among the most high-profile examples is Shopify, whose CEO told employees they must now prove why they “cannot get what they want done using AI” before asking for more employees and resources. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote in a memo sent to employees in March. “This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” The chief executive of language learning app Duolingo, Luis von Ahn, issued a similar edict in May, writing that the firm would gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle and that a budget for new employees would only be given “if a team cannot automate more of their work.” Enough firms hedging in this way, alongside a wider economic slowdown, may indeed be suppressing overall hiring, especially in business and professional services. But those trends do not amount to large-scale replacement of existing workers by AI agents. Then there are the firms creating the AI tools themselves — the ones other businesses are ostensibly looking to purchase and deploy to automate their workforces. These AI developers, including Dell, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce, have been shedding workers not tied to AI product development and shifting resources toward those who are. If AI is causing job losses, it’s not because it’s doing someone else’s job. It’s because budgets — and demands on the bottom line — are changing. The state of hiring at Microsoft is illustrative. Over the past several weeks, the tech giant — whose stock has surged 17% year to date thanks in part to the popularity of its Copilot AI tool — has announced job cuts affecting some 15,000 roles, or about 7% of its workforce. In this case, some human replacement does appear to be occurring: CEO Satya Nadella said recently that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI — something Bloomberg News confirmed in a report showing software engineering roles made up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in one of the recent layoff rounds. Yet other analysts indicated the cuts were also likely designed to offset the costs associated with Microsoft’s massive buildout of data centers designed to handle AI computer processing. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000” in order to make up for its increased capital expenditures, said Gil Luria, a tech research analyst at D.A. Davidson financial group, in an interview with Reuters. In a note to clients, analysts with the consultancy Capital Economics said not all mentions of AI by businesses discussing their financial picture should be taken at face value. “For some firms, AI is a way to spin job losses driven by poor financial performance in a more positive light,” they wrote. AI is also affecting the hiring and recruiting process itself. A galaxy of startups now offers tools that can perform the job of entire HR departments, from scanning resumes to interviewing candidates. At IBM, “a couple hundred” HR workers have been recently replaced by AI agents, CEO Arvind Krishna told The Wall Street Journal in May. Yet with those efficiencies, the company was able to hire more programmers and salespeople, he said. “While we have done a huge amount of work inside IBM on leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up, because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas,” Krishna said. For anyone struggling to find new work, AI is not without blame. But experts say economic factors continue to vastly outweigh the threat from automation. “Our research has shown that AI will fundamentally change a whole lot of jobs, some by a lot,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. In the case of software developers especially, she said, roles are being completely transformed. “But does it still mean AI took that job? I don’t think so,” she said. “There’s not evidence that it’s fully replacing whole workers, or that the current slowdown can be attributed to it.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

UPDATED 23:06 EDT / JULY 03 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Artificial intelligence model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic that have had a mostly free ride on scraping the entire internet to train their models may be facing a serious roadblock now. Internet infrastructure services firm Cloudflare this week enabled website operators to charge AI developers for access to their material. It’s a bit of a closing-the-barn-door-after-the-horses-fled situation — not Cloudflare’s fault — but since AI models need constant training and retraining, maybe this will change the balance of power. Meanwhile, competition is intensifying in AI — isn’t it always? Apple, for one, is playing off Anthropic against OpenAI to run its voice assistant Siri. Elon Musk’s xAI raised $10 billion to upgrade its infrastructure to stay in the game. And Baidu has open-sourced its Ernie AI model in a bid to take on OpenAI. Can Intel survive? Dave Vellante and David Floyer think new CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s plan has a chance, but a lot still has to go right — including some downsized ambitions, the latest of which is that it’s looking at moving on from one of its fab processes. No sooner did Musk rake President Trump’s awful-for-every-reason budget bill and call the GOP the Porky Pig Party (for once he’s not wrong) than Trump said he’d maybe review Musk’s immigration status. Then Tesla’s stock tanked. The next day, Tesla deliveries plunged but not as much as investors feared, and shares rose 5%. More popcorn, please! Cybersecurity firm Cato Networks raised a massive $359 million late-stage funding round, as consolidation in the industry continued. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finally closed its acquisition of Juniper Networks after getting the green light from the Justice Department. Zeus Kerravala looked at the implications for both sets of customers, but as always, it will depend on how well the acquirer manages the combination.

Title: Report: Microsoft's 2025 layoffs revolve around its desperate $80 billion AI infrastructure investment

The Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, and a report claims it's all in the name of freeing up spending money to invest more heavily in AI infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-growing AI bubble. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft initiated yet another round of layoffs this week, impacting multiple organizations including gaming, sales, and marketing. Over 9,000 employees were cut, on top of the 6,000 that took place back in May. That means the Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025 alone, and it's all to fund more AI infrastructure. According to a report from The Seattle Times, Microsoft is moving to reduce headcount to free up more capital for AI spending. Specifically, the company is looking to invest more money in AI infrastructure and technologies, and is making various cuts across many organizations and divisions to fund these efforts. "Microsoft’s push into AI doesn’t mean the company is replacing workers with the technology. Rather, the significant cost of building out the infrastructure over multiple years has Microsoft looking to trim costs where it can," The Seattle Times reports. That said, a chunk of the roles Microsoft has laid off in recent months were roles that could be aided by AI technology. The company has invested heavily in AI technology that can debug and write code and is reportedly planning to make AI use mandatory with checks to ensure this conducted in performance reviews. Microsoft has announced that it intends to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure in the coming year to keep pace with the rest of the AI bubble. This is up $25 billion over the previous fiscal year. In recent weeks, reports have suggested that Microsoft and OpenAI's multibillion dollar partnership has become strained as both companies seek different things. It should be clear to anyone following Microsoft closely that the company has become AI crazed in the last two years. Since 2023, Microsoft has rushed to implement AI technology in as many products and services as it can, regardless of whether that technology is ready for mainstream use. The recent layoffs amassing over 15,000 people come as Microsoft signs off one of its best years ever financially. The company has soared ahead of Apple in market cap, and is trailing NVIDIA as most valuable company in the world. Investing heavily in AI infrastructure and products at the cost of everything else is proving popular amongst shareholders. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told employees that despite layoffs, the Xbox "platform, hardware, and game roadmap [has] never looked stronger." Microsoft scrapped two in-development game projects as part of its most recent wave of layoffs, all to make room for more AI infrastructure it seems. Ultimately, the recent layoffs have left a foul taste in a lot of people's mouths. And it's not just Microsoft, though it appears to have laid off a considerable amount in 2025 alone. Layoffs have hit everyone from Meta to Amazon, impacting over 50,000 jobs in tech across hundreds of companies, many of which are reporting record profits. Unfortunately, this wave of layoffs doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already hinted that the company expects to reduce headcount in the next few years as AI becomes more adopted internally. It's unlikely Amazon will be alone in this thinking.

Title: Microsoft to cut about four percent of jobs amid hefty AI bets

Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off nearly 4 percent of its workforce as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged US$80 billion (A$122 billion) in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft has now planned to reduce organisational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on July 2. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Microsoft confirmed to Reuters that its gaming division was impacted by the layoffs, although not the majority of the unit, but did not provide further details. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across large corporations spanning multiple sectors in recent months as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against financial pressures.

Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off nearly 4 percent of its workforce as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged US$80 billion (A$122 billion) in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft has now planned to reduce organisational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on July 2. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Microsoft confirmed to Reuters that its gaming division was impacted by the layoffs, although not the majority of the unit, but did not provide further details. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit and communications staff.

Title: Microsoft's enshittification of Xbox, Surface, and even Windows itself, are by design — with greed and corner-cutting replacing innovation

Time Published: 2025-07-03T20:08:33Z
Full Content:
With Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood placing unrealistic expectations on Xbox, Windows, and others — the damage is becoming increasingly untenable. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how Xbox had turned a corner, following a decent Xbox Showcase and a firm commitment to hardware. Speculation had been swirling that Xbox will hand off its hardware aspirations to OEMs like ASUS, leaving first-party hardware teams and customers facing an uncertain future. Microsoft's gaming financials don't always look healthy on the face of it either, putting a dark cloud over the entire platform. How naive of me. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled that 9,000 were facing the axe, bringing the annual total to 15,300 or more. Many hundreds of those layoffs were at Xbox specifically, with cuts that seemingly fell indiscriminately across the entire portfolio. Staffers who had been at Xbox for a decade or more, personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue, got the cut. Legendary leaders at major studios were culled, projects were shut down, and in one case, an entire studio was closed. There's a meme in the Xbox community about how "Xbox is dead" every five minutes, because of the non-stop roller coaster of changing strategies and inconsistent messaging Microsoft has foisted onto the customer base (and employees too) in recent years. Today, Microsoft announced that Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox, and is the first-ever PlayStation published title on the platform. You couldn't really plan for more unfortunate timing. Xbox is dead, Xbox is alive, and so on. The thing is, this isn't unique to Xbox. It's applicable to every department at Microsoft all up. As of this year, I've been covering the Xbox, Windows, Surface, Windows Phone, and Microsoft beat for ten years. I came in as an amateur blogger, just an Xbox fan, with little knowledge of the tech business or business in general. I've learned a lot over the years, through all of the successes and mistakes, over-confidence and under confidence. Through it all, I'd always tried to hold on to fandom for Xbox for myself, the community, and the hobby in general — while remaining critical, and voicing the concerns of customers. We all rallied for bringing more Japanese games for Xbox, we called for boosted localization, and called for improvements to the Xbox PC experience. Microsoft delivered in varying degrees, but the staggering cadence of mixed messaging, changing strategies, and inconsistency is a disservice to both customers and employees alike. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. I'm joining many others in feeling that under CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood — being a "fan" for devs, potential employees, and customers alike — is becoming simply impossible. Microsoft as an entity feels directionless, changing strategies on a dime, and laying off thousands in its fickle wake. Sources who remain anonymous due to lack of authority to speak on internal matters have pointed the blame for yesterday's mammoth layoffs firmly at Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Hood's unrealistic fiscal expectations on Microsoft's subsequent divisions have created a culture of fear and doubt, ironically impacting productivity and thus profitability. There's sentiment among Microsoft staffers that many of the layoffs revolve around a broadening shift towards artificial intelligence, with executives and activist investor groups at the top growing increasingly concerned that Microsoft is losing, or may have even already lost, the AI race. It's well-documented that OpenAI and Microsoft's partnership is fractured, with OpenAI desperate to free itself from the restrictions its early investment deal with Microsoft have placed upon it. Microsoft enjoys exclusivity to various aspects of OpenAI's operation, including the first-right-of-refusal to hosting AI workloads, on top of revenue sharing requirements. OpenAI no longer grants Microsoft exclusive rights to hosting its services, however. And furthermore, all of these deals have an imminent expiry date: 2030. To that end, investors are nervous that all of Microsoft's AI "success" hinges solely on OpenAI, who is also bleeding talent to Meta at an alarming rate. At this nascent stage, it's not unrealistic to think a major breakthrough at a competing platform, particularly at a company like Meta whose social apps remain globally dominant, could completely unravel OpenAI at a moment's notice. Microsoft's position in AI would evaporate overnight, conceding the future of computing to other tech companies. Microsoft's home-grown AI products, many of which rely on OpenAI models anyway, are by and large complete trash in practice. Copilot is a stunted version of ChatGPT, the "Microsoft 365 Copilot" disaster is painfully limited in scope. Even bare-bones basics like generative erase in the Photos app pale in comparison to Samsung's, and Microsoft's internal efforts have nothing to show but tech demos and promises, with no real products. The only "real" product Microsoft has put out so far, Windows Recall, is almost universally hated as a privacy nightmare made manifest, despite changes Microsoft has attempted to make. The Copilot+ PC range that its tied to has been nothing short of a spectacular flop, while sacrificing the Surface brand in the process. It's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase this latest AI splurge without it. There's sentiment that Microsoft executives and activist shareholders resent the idea that investment had fallen towards Call of Duty and Activision-Blizzard, instead of broadening their early AI investments. Microsoft is set to invest a similarly mammoth-esque $80 billion in new AI-enabled training centers around the world to try and turn its fortunes around, but what if it had had $160 billion from having not purchased Activision? These latest layoffs are funding this refreshed attempt to chase an external innovation, and represent the human cost of Microsoft's poor planning. Quick edit: since I wrote this, I saw that The Seattle Times has corroborated that these layoffs revolve around this $80 billion AI infrastructure investment, foisted on Xbox and other departments to account for the jitters around the potential failure of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI. Indeed, it's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase AI without it. From Surface to Windows Phone, to Xbox and Windows itself, under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has utterly forgotten that real humans, customers, actually use its products. And seemingly, that real humans, actually build its products. When the Windows Recall privacy PR disaster happened last year, I sat to myself thinking "how in the fuck couldn't someone have seen this coming?" It was literally the first thing I thought of when I saw that Microsoft was putting out an app that would creepily watch everything on your screen. It screamed of product design by spreadsheet — the "people use AI, so AI good" brainchild of a mindless boardroom meeting that nobody in the room was really paying attention to. The entire Copilot+ PC range screams of this, utterly uninspired, underbaked and unthoughtful approach that has typified Surface since product architects Panos Panay and Ralf Groene were sadly driven out of the company, as Panay rebuilds his all-star team at Amazon instead. Surface used to be at the cutting edge of hardware innovation, producing head-turning products that even Apple itself couldn't ignore. And sure, the execution wasn't always on point. Under Panos Panay, Surface had become a reliable fixture of Microsoft's product calendar, and drove a wave of innovation and improved designs across Windows' entire OEM portfolio. In 2025, that's all but gone — a shell of its former self, with Microsoft using Surface as a vehicle to placate whatever latest tech fad Satya Nadella finds himself interested in at the time. There's nobody driving real innovation at Surface anymore, and it's sad. Windows Mixed Reality, the "metaverse" buzzword from 2023, Windows Phone, Microsoft Band, even Microsoft's painfully slow efforts with Windows on Arm compatibility — under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has this strange and uncanny ability to put out loud PR beats and then utterly under-invest and thus, under-deliver. We're seeing the same situation play out now with Copilot in slow motion, although that $80 billion investment is nothing to scoff at — it sounds like it's more about supporting other's services rather than Microsoft's own innovations. Microsoft Build events used to be a legendary confluence of developer passion and consumer product innovation, with exciting product reveals and service enhancements. Now, it's a dull parade of investor bait that typifies Nadella's approach to the company. Therein lies why I say Microsoft is now more of an investment bank than a product innovator. Like locusts, Microsoft's fiscal approach has been to swarm into a section with money and acquisitions. Then, under-invest and under-deliver, subsequently ruin the product, and then bail when the next over-hyped tech fad opportunity rolls around. This is before we talk about things like cutting corners around security, leading to the unprecedented Azure email hack, among other things. There's a litany of examples of this dating back across my entire career, and even further back before it. The brunt of this week's layoffs weren't in Xbox, but I don't see how Xbox can thrive in the corporate environment being constructed by Amy Hood and Satya Nadella, where investment mentality supersedes customer confidence, and employee wellbeing. But the cash keeps rolling in, so none of it matters, seemingly. I've been critical of Microsoft corporate for years, but Xbox enjoyed a bit of a bubble while Microsoft from the top largely ignored its operations. That was until Activision-Blizzard, of course. My naivete as an modern Xbox fan hit a turning point during Summer Game Fest this year. For most of my career, to my knowledge, Microsoft had these Xbox FanFest events at its shows like Gamescom and E3, where dozens, and even hundreds of fans were invited to participate in events. Microsoft wilfully and actively engaged in curating community fandom in this way, and it has done so in the past with Windows Phone, Surface, and other products. This year at Summer Game Fest, Microsoft had no Xbox FanFest of its own. But those who had been attending for years, and enjoyed the community and camaraderie, pooled and spent their own money to curate an Xbox FanFest event in LA. On the one hand, it was awesome to see the community rally, but on the other, it was utterly disappointing that Microsoft itself wouldn't spare the cash. Microsoft is approaching a 4 trillion-dollar market capitalization, with $22 billion in profits last quarter. They couldn't have spared a few thousand to put together an event for fans this year? Couldn't Satya Nadella have thrown a few dollars in from his $79 million stock awards package last year? One week ago at this time, myself, @benkenobi2020 , @DonteJMoody @Porshapwr Hargeet, @FonzGaming, @shaunlabrie @webdave @corkenstein @MrboomstickXL were getting the venue ready for Xbox Community Watch Party. Nerves were high as well as Stress. It was all worth it and a very… pic.twitter.com/9YwEFkXvjAJune 14, 2025 In among the mixed messaging over Xbox exclusives, the lack of clarity on Xbox's future — it was that that really didn't sit right with me. I'd tell myself it was all just a transition, with spending squeezed and playtime hours down ... The vast majority of gaming hours and spend sent into Fortnite and Roblox, and economic confidence hitting new lows. But then came this week's layoffs. These latest layoffs seem utterly indiscriminate — an overly aggressive and reductive move purely aimed to boost margins at the cost of everyone and everything else. Entire teams wiped out, families left to wonder what their future would look like. People who'd given huge chunks of their lives, blood sweat and tears, toward helping make Microsoft shareholders and execs rich. Friends who'd worked together for years, and worked with devs, fans, and press for years — some of whom were personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue that helped shareholders get richer. I know it's not as if other companies haven't had layoffs, and I know that Xbox has things cooking. But I feel like it's in spite of Microsoft, rather than because of Microsoft. When you look at Microsoft's other products, like Windows 11, Surface, and even further back — the empty promises, the rug pulls, and broken promises, it screams to me of a company that simply isn't willing to take a risk, or give products the time they need to shine. Microsoft as an entity no longer has any real direction, and no conviction, and crucially, no willingness to actually compete. Microsoft represents the apex of late stage capitalism, where failure is rewarded, and the ability to shift capital rapidly voids the necessity to deliver for consumers and society in general. Microsoft increasingly just seems to go where other companies, true innovators, say the money is — looking for the next fad to devour and process, rather than curate and cultivate. How will Xbox, Surface, or Windows 11, grow without risk, investment, and curating consumer confidence? In a world where Microsoft has enough capital to just move wherever the wind is blowing, it simply doesn't seem to care. It doesn't have to be this way. The brutality of these layoffs is just another symptom of a sick money-first mentality. But how can you stop it? Microsoft employs hundreds of thousands of people, none of whom deserve to be in this position either, and most of whom aren't paid well enough for their hard work. Most of whom simply want to do great things and create great experiences and art, as Microsoft corporate works their hardest to stop them. Microsoft is a company that has no real mission or ethos anymore, and one that behaves more like a bank than a tech company, and it is certainly not one that deserves "fans." Maybe it never did. In any case, Microsoft is making more money than God right now. So, I guess it just doesn't matter. And ... maybe it never did. Edit: I had previously blamed Microsoft for its response to the Crowdstrike situation too in an upper segment here, but Microsoft granting kernel access to vendors was a result of European Union legislation, not as a result of outsourcing security. Apologies for that. But, there are plenty of other examples where Microsoft's security investments have been lacking, and have been blamed on corner cutting and putting profits first.

Title: Report: Microsoft tying to move towards AI agents amid mass layoffs

Microsoft is going through another round of mass layoffs with 9,000 employees in various divisions being let go. While the management has called these layoffs organizational changes, a new report citing a developer with knowledge of the situation claims that Microsoft is looking to replace its human workforce with AI. Speaking at Meta’s inaugural LlamaCon AI developer event in May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had shared that about 30% of the company’s code is written by AI. Now, it looks like the company is going full steam ahead with AI integration and this could have something to do with the recent mass layoffs. A report by Engadget citing a developer at Microsoft who also received the memo from Phil Spencer, but supposedly was not let go, shared that management is “trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents." While the report does not elaborate on this claim, the memo stated “increase agility and effectiveness” as one of the reasons for the layoffs. If implemented correctly, AI agents can significantly optimize various workflows so the developer’s claim of Microsoft trying to replace human workers with AI agents surely has weight to it. This has become an industry trend as even Amazon had recently issued a memo to its employees stating that AI agents will replace some human jobs. Furthermore, the developer also shared his anger about the memo and the current situation of development at Microsoft. “I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about,” the developer reportedly told Engadget. They added that employees at Microsoft are not happy about the quality of the product and that a lot of pep talk is being used to try and up the morale. It should be noted that Microsoft has not associated AI agents with the mass layoffs but considering the AI-written code, using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and other AI related internal implementations, AI agents seem to be the end goal for the company.

Title: Microsoft is laying off 9,000 employees in its latest huge job cut

Microsoft is cutting more jobs as it continues AI push When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is cutting 9,000 jobs with most of those facing the ax being employed in the Gaming division. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said (via CNBC). The job cuts seek to reduce the layers of managers standing between individual contributors and top executives, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Cutting jobs seems to be the growing trend for many large companies, with Microsoft cutting just under 1% of its workforce in January 2025. Another 6,000 workers, mostly programmers, were cut in May and a further 300 jobs cut in June. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.” Amazon has also gone through several waves of layoffs this year, with CEO Andy Jassy repeatedly saying that AI could replace some of its workers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! For Microsoft though, the layoffs are more to do with improving business performance and reducing internal friction. Intel has also lined up a significant wave of layoffs, with the company looking to cut 15-20% of its factory workforce. Intel already laid off 15,000 people in August 2024. But while Intel has been struggling with declining revenues and market performance, Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter.

Title: CEOs have a new AI flex

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Good morning. If you’re in the habit of listening to CEOs, you’ll notice a new trend among leaders talking about AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants. And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said over 30% of code at Google is now generated by AI. It’s the latest CEO flex: Citing numbers showing that AI is doing heavy lifting internally. The move presents the company as being ahead of the AI curve and invariably grabs the attention of people who matter. Investors hear the magic words that the business is on track to save money—presumably accomplished—but rarely explicitly stated, through future job cuts. It also signals to clients of the Big Tech companies making the pronouncements that they should open their wallets, pronto, to incorporate more AI into their operations, or risk falling behind. But how significant these CEO flexes ultimately are from Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft is difficult to know. The metrics cited seem precise, yet when asked, their spokespeople declined to provide any details about how the numbers were calculated or how they defined the work that they claim AI has done. “The truth is, we don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group, in a message to Fortune. “Are we counting lines of code, tasks completed, hours saved, or business outcomes influenced?” But Netherlands-based occupational psychologist Marais Bester thinks something else is afoot. “I think it’s also sort of an indicator to employees, saying, you better watch your back, you better perform.” From a business psychology standpoint, that’s not an indicator of good leadership, he added. Shonna Waters, an organizational psychologist and CEO of advisory firm Fractional Insights, thinks the companies that will succeed are those with “structural empathy”—that is, building systems that bring in frontline worker voices. “At the end of the day, you need the humans to still be the ones actually adopting the AI, you need to bring them along with your journey and figure out how to do it in concert with them, as opposed to something you’re doing to them.” You can read my full story for Fortune here. — Sharon Goldman More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill advances to final vote The debate went late into the night but expect the House to vote on the whole thing today. The president has not been happy with Congress’s delays. Axios has an interesting list of weird stuff that is in the gigantic act. FHFA head asks Congress to investigate Fed’s Powell Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, published a letter on X accusing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of giving deceptive testimony to Congress and demanding an investigation. President Trump then piled on with his own post calling for Powell to “resign immediately.” Reality check: Pulte did not provide specifics about what he believes Powell said wrongly. This is yet another extraordinary chapter in the book of Trump’s political tirades against his top central banker. Powell appears to have earned the president’s dislike simply because he has set monetary policy independently of the desires of the White House. CEOs are now openly saying AI will cut jobs The chief executives of Ford, Google, Amazon, Anthropic, and JPMorgan Chase have all openly stated that white-collar jobs will go into decline. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has said the company won’t hire new workers unless it can be proved that AI cannot do the job. Layoffs at Microsoft Microsoft is cutting around 9,000 jobs—almost 4% of its global workforce—in an effort to streamline operations and continue restructuring efforts. This is the biggest round of layoffs Microsoft has had since 2023. ADP says jobs declined The private sector is shrinking and lost 33,000 jobs last month, per a new report from ADP. “Though layoffs continue to be rare,” said ADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson, “a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month.” Vietnam strikes trade deal with the U.S. The U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the U.S. and goods that have been “transshipped” through Vietnam will face a 40% tax. Scaramucci’s second act Eight years after his disastrous 11-day stint as White House spokesperson, Anthony Scaramucci has remade his life as one of the most influential podcasters in politics and finance via his ability to read the room and draw together some of the world’s most powerful and influential people. Apple alleges former employee stole trade secrets Apple is suing a former senior product design engineer for allegedly stealing files with proprietary information about the $3,500 Vision Pro headset before leaving the company.

Goldman Sachs on employment: “We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 85k in June, below consensus of 110k and the three-month average of +135k.

Title: Microsoft Cuts 9,000 Jobs, Cancels Xbox Games Including Perfect Dark Reboot

Microsoft is cutting jobs once again. After laying off some employees in the gaming division in January and around 6,000 employees across various verticals in May, the company on Wednesday confirmed to The Seattle Times that it is reducing its workforce once again by almost 4%. The latest round of layoffs is part of “organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Gizmodo. Microsoft hasn’t confirmed which departments are affected or how many employees have been let go. The Redmond-based company had 228,000 employees as of June 2024. After reducing the recent job cuts, 4% of the workforce would translate to nearly 9,000 employees. Gaming is among the departments that have taken a major hit. “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Xbox leader Phil Spencer writes in a memo to employees, viewed by IGN. Those affected will be contacted by HR and be provided with severance benefits as required by local laws, including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, Spencer notes. Those eliminated from Xbox can apply for open roles across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority, he adds. Following Spencer’s statement, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed to employees that it would be cancelling the development of games like Everwild, Perfect Dark, and several other announced projects. These developments follow a Bloomberg report from last month that said thousands of Microsoft jobs would be cut after the end of the fiscal year in June. That report suggested marketing and sales teams could take the biggest hit; however, the latest reports indicate gaming has been affected more than other departments. We have reached out to Microsoft for further clarification regarding the departments affected and the number of workers let go. The months and years ahead may continue to be tough for tech employees. Intel is planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles, while Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already warned employees that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer in the next few years.

BNY Mellon has introduced AI-powered workers with company logins that operate autonomously. They handle tasks like coding, payment validation and vulnerability detection without direct oversight. BNY Mellon's first two AI personas were built in three months, with plans to integrate email and Teams accounts. Goldman Sachs has deployed an AI assistant to 10,000 employees, aiming for firmwide rollout by year-end. Tools like Goldman's "GS AI Assistant" proofread documents, translate code, and may soon execute complex tasks. JPMorgan's internal chatbot is used by 230,000 staff, signaling widespread AI integration. Banks debate AI autonomy levels, while Bloomberg predicts 200,000 finance jobs may disappear by 2028 as AI takes over middle-office functions â reshaping traditional employment definitions. AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll."

AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll." The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) has quietly ushered in a new era of workplace automation, deploying "digital employees" powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These digital employees are equipped with their own credentials such as company logins, just like their human counterparts. They also operate autonomouslyÂ âÂ validating transactions, identifying software vulnerabilities and communicating with human managers, all without direct oversight. BNY Chief InformationÂ Officer (CIO) Leigh-Ann Russell said BNY Mellon's initial two AI personas were developed in just three months, and were assigned to specific teams to restrict data access. One was designed to handle coding duties, and the other was assigned to do payment validation. Soon, they will gain email and Microsoft Teams accounts â blurring the line between human and machine collaboration. "This is the next level," Russell told the Wall Street Journal. "In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee. Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past. For better or worse, the bots are now on payroll. Watch this clip of humanoid robots taking over manufacturing processes at a factory in China's Shenzhen province.

Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past.

Title: Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 jobs as it invests in AI
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl0w1w394o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D
Time Published: 2025-07-03T03:09:43Z
Full Content:
Microsoft has confirmed that it will lay off as many as 9,000 workers, in the technology giant's latest wave of job cuts this year. The company said several divisions would be affected without specifying which ones but reports suggest that its Xbox video gaming unit will be hit. Microsoft has set out plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and is spending $80bn (£68.6bn) in huge data centres to train AI models. A spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The cuts would equate to 4% of Microsoft's 228,000-strong global workforce. Some video game projects have reportedly been affected by them. According to an internal email seen by The Verge and gaming publication IGN, Microsoft has told gaming staff that the planned reboot of first-person shooter series Perfect Dark, along with another title, Everwild, will be cancelled. The Initiative, a Microsoft-owned studio behind the Perfect Dark reboot, will also be shut down, the memo stated. Job cuts have also affected staff across wider studios owned by Microsoft, including Forza Motorsport maker Turn 10 and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, according to employee posts on social media seen by the BBC. Matt Firor, studio director of ZeniMax Online Studios, announced on Wednesday he would be leaving his position in July after more than 18 years at the studio. "While I won't be working on the game anymore, I will be cheering you on and adding to the thousands of hours I've already spent in-game," said a post attributed to Mr Firor by ZeniMax on X. Romero Games Ltd, an independent studio based in Galway, Ireland - co-founded by Doom developer John Romero - has also cut staff after funding for its game was axed by its publisher. "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected," said Mr Romero in a post on X. Microsoft has initiated three other rounds of redundancies so far in 2025, including in May when it said it would cut 6,000 roles. An official database maintained by Washington state shows that more than 800 of the positions eliminated will be concentrated in the city of Redmond as well as in Bellevue, another Microsoft hub in its home state. In recent years, like many other big technology firms, Microsoft has refocussed its business towards developing AI, including investing in data centres and chips. Last year, the company hired British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its new Microsoft AI division. A top Microsoft executive recently told the BBC that the next half century will "fundamentally be defined by artificial intelligence,", changing the way we work and interact with one another. Microsoft is also a major investor and shareholder in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, although the relationship has reportedly grown tense in recent months. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft has struggled to sell its AI assistant, known as Copilot, to business customers because many office workers prefer ChatGPT. The layoffs among rank and file workers at Microsoft come as major US tech companies court top AI talent. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has been poaching talent from rivals to form a 'superintelligence' lab. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally involved in recruitment. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said recently that members of his team had been getting offers of more than $100m (£74.3m) as "signing bonuses" from Meta. Last month, Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he expected AI would replace some of his firm's workers.
