Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned of AI displacing entry-level workers, and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tech will wipe out half of white-collar jobs, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman has a wildly different take on young workers’ fate in the age of AI. Earlier this year, Garman said replacing junior software developers with AI was “one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard,” and it’s a point he stands by. In an interview with WIRED published on Tuesday, Garman said displacing junior engineers and employees with new tech is a bad business move. Entry-level workers are usually paid the least, meaning getting rid of their positions first in favor of higher-paid senior talent is not a cost-effective strategy, he noted. Moreso, these fresh-faced young workers are likely recent college graduates with energy, excitement, and deep familiarity with AI tools. Eliminating them, in Garman’s eyes, would be myopic. “At some point that whole thing explodes on itself,” Garman said. “If you have no talent pipeline that you’re building and no junior people that you’re mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that’s where we get some of the best ideas.” “You’ve gotta think longer term about the health of a company,” he added. “And just saying ‘OK great, we’re never going to hire junior people anymore,’ that’s just a nonstarter for anyone who’s trying to build a long-term company.” A Stanford University study published in August suggested AI is already starting to have its way with entry-level workers. The research revealed that “the AI revolution” is having a “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market,” particularly 22- to 25-year-old software engineers and customer service agents. Despite Garman’s adamance on AI not replacing young workers, Amazon’s own automation advancements have coincided with the company laying off thousands of employees this fall. The tech giant announced in October it would slash 14,000 jobs, mostly middle management positions. Earlier this year, Amazon laid off a smaller portion of workers from divisions including AWS, its Wondery podcast division, and the consumer devices unit. Rather than attribute the axings to AI, Amazon instead said the layoffs were part of an effort to make the business more efficient after a period of growth, as well as resolve cultural mismatches that emerged in the workforce. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” CEO Andy Jassy said at the time. “It’s culture.” Still, AI advancements are poised to impact Amazon’s workforce. The memo outlining the fall layoffs cites the transforming technology of AI as the impetus for improving workflows with leaner teams. A June memo from the company said AI efficiency gains will “reduce our total corporate workforce,” and a New York Times investigation published in October reported Amazon had a lofty goal to automate 75% of its work, translating to about 600,000 jobs the tech giant would not ultimately need to hire for. AWS did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Garman isn’t naive to the workplace upheaval AI could bring. He predicted the technology will initially create a burst of new jobs, as well as reduce several roles, but he was certain that AI would ultimately transform the nature of work. “One of the things that I tell our own employees is ‘Your job is going to change.’ There’s no two ways about it,” he told WIRED. The 49-year-old AWS CEO said employees have the potential to have more impact and responsibilities as a result of AI, but it will require learning news skills, as well as organizing teams differently. While entry-level workers should not be the primary victims of AI’s workplace shake-ups, other jobs and industries will be impacted, Garman noticed. “If they don’t, they’ll most likely get left behind by people who move faster and do change,” he said. “There is going to be some disruption in there for sure. Like there is no question in my mind.”

Title: Amazon is set to lay off 370 workers at its European HQ

Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments. Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are "adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies." The company claims to be going "well beyond industry benchmarks" in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it's offering. An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don't land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000. One employee told Bloomberg that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks. Amazon said in October it would cut 14,000 jobs from its global workforce amid its deepening embrace of AI. It was reported that same month that the company's plans to ramp up its robotics operations could put around half a million jobs in the US at risk.

By Eddie Makuch on December 16, 2025 at 6:49AM PST Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft. He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield. Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle." "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said. Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs." March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles. The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company, including at its gaming division. Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: How the experts predict digital ad spend will pan out in 2026

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → U.S. advertising spending is now forecast to grow 6.6% next year — that’s not taking into account political ad spend that occurred in 2025 — down from an estimated 11% in the past 12 months, according to the latest analysis from Madison & Wall. The findings are reflected in a similar global forecast from media consultancy Ebiquity, which found that almost half (48%) of marketers expect to increase their media spend next year, with digital video and CTV likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, sources predict this moderate growth is most likely to be concentrated in a few hands, with the titans of Silicon Valley on course to benefit most from this trend. Per Madison & Wall’s revised assessment, programmatic spend follows stronger-than-expected performance in 2025 and reflects a moderation in growth rather than a downturn. For programmatic advertising, the forecast points to continued expansion in automated buying, concentrated in digital formats that deliver measurable performance, while much of the open internet — that includes independent ad tech — is under intense pressure to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. The upgrade comes after another strong quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% year over year in Q3 2025, excluding political spending, the fastest quarterly pace since early 2022 (see chart). Digital advertising increased 21%, raising digital’s share of total ad spend to 72%, with the forecast underscoring the continued dominance of channels with first-party data, closed-loop measurement, and AI-driven optimization. Looking ahead, Madison & Wall expects economic conditions to remain broadly supportive in 2026, despite rising policy and geopolitical risks. Consensus forecasts point to real GDP growth of roughly 1.8% and inflation near 2.8%, implying nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5%. While the correlation between economic growth and advertising has weakened, the firm views nominal growth as a meaningful reference point for advertising demand. It expects advertising growth to slow gradually rather than correct sharply. Within that environment, programmatic advertising is expected to increase its share of open internet transactions. Madison & Wall forecasts programmatic revenues across the open internet to grow 4.4% in 2026, with programmatic accounting for 74% of open internet ad revenues. Growth is expected to be driven by programmatic connected TV, digital out-of-home, and digital audio, each projected to grow at double-digit rates as automation expands across newer digital formats. However, total open internet advertising revenues are expected to be roughly flat. Programmatic growth in 2026 is therefore driven primarily by a shift in buying methods rather than an expansion of overall spend. Programmatic revenues tied to digital platforms and publishers are expected to decline slightly, reflecting ongoing pricing pressure and uneven demand outside large-scale platforms. In his end-of-year assessment, W Media Research‘s Karsten Weide remarked how much of the ad tech ecosystem on the open internet was in open conflict, highlighting how the Q3 dispute of transaction IDs, or “TIDs,” between buy- and sell-side players is an open wound. “What once sounded like a technical dispute over wrappers and auction mechanics has escalated into a power struggle over who governs the open internet,” he noted. By contrast, closed digital platforms are expected to continue to capture a disproportionate share of incremental spending. Madison & Wall forecasts commerce media to grow 16% in 2026, social media 15%, and search 8%. The firm expects ad tech platforms to introduce additional AI-powered buying tools designed to replicate the automated, outcome-focused buying models already prevalent within walled gardens. Madison & Wall further noted how advertisers are placing greater emphasis on price and performance, often at the expense of transparency and control, with spend increasingly directed toward platforms that bundle creative, optimization, and measurement within the cost of inventory. Direct relationships between advertisers and large media owners continue to expand; this is a trend that reduces reliance on agency-managed buying systems, with Madison & Wall expecting AI to enhance this trend as more workflow tools are made available in the industry. Meanwhile, search and commerce advertising are expected to remain structurally resilient, while publishers across the open internet face greater pressure to adapt their business models. In that context, programmatic advertising continues to function as a core transaction layer — growing in importance, but operating within a more constrained overall market. “If I have the opportunity to leave, I’m leaving. Omnicom is NOT competitive in my eyes. Their benefits suck and they are moving away from creative driven [sic] work and focusing on data driven [sic] work and pumping out as much content as possible.” — An Omnicom staff member speaks truth to power on the gift that keeps on giving, i.e., the OmnicomIPGmerger subreddit, while others use other threads to estimate that the layoffs are not even halfway done. From the 2026 Integral Ad Science Industry Pulse Report: WPP estimates commerce media spending to overtake TV this year The company’s latest global ad spend forecasts predict that commerce media will account for 15.6% of global ad spend in 2025, compared with the 14.6% spent on linear and connected TV. The case against AI agents for programmatic ad buying Christopher Francia, director of product development and client performance at Attention Arc explains discusses whether or not AI agents be involved in programmatic ad buys. Plot spoiler: “We’re not trusting that to large language model-based agents.” Google tells advertisers it’ll bring ads to Gemini in 2026 Google has said to advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its AI chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations, according to Adweek’s Trishla Ostwal. AI brings MFA to social media… how advertisers can avoid it Zefr CEO Rich Raddon argues that generative AI has led to the re-emergence of an unwelcome visitor from the past for most advertisers. X shuts down EU’s ad account after first major DSA fine The European Commission issued a €120 million fine to X — its first fine issued under the Digital Services Act (DSA) following prior allegations. Following the fine and a public response from X CEO Elon Musk, X shut down the Commission’s ad account. Advertiser battles Google, alleges failure to disclose queries “Google prioritizes profit over integrity by using its Google Ads program to deceive its customers, primarily small businesses, out of their hard-earned money,” the advertiser argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Case Pitts in San Jose. “Since 2020, Google has accomplished this grift, by hiding a significant portion of its client charges inside an impenetrable ‘black box’ that not even Houdini could open.” Over the past year, Roblox has become harder for brands to ignore — not because it has resolved the challenges of digital commerce, but because of the scale at which younger consumers already use it. Corporate development sources estimate the deal valuation to be above $300 million, claiming tvScientific’s gross revenue is approximately $100 million.

Title: The robot revolution

Time Published: 2025-12-15T22:52:01Z
Full Content:
SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Advances in tech and AI are producing android machine workers. What will that mean for humans? Humanoid robots that can obey commands, make decisions, and deftly perform manual tasks have long been a sci-fi fantasy. Now they are becoming reality. Artificial intelligence, coupled with advances in robotics, has the potential to give humanoid robots unprecedented power to analyze, “think,” and learn. Tech evangelists say these robots will have a transformative impact on workplaces and even in our homes, and not in distant decades but in the next few years. Elon Musk believes robots will be “the biggest product ever in history.” His Tesla robot Optimus can already climb stairs and carry 45-pound objects, and he says Tesla will deliver a million units a year by 2030. By 2035, Citigroup predicts, some 1.3 billion robots will be in operation, both in industrial settings and in households, nursing homes, and construction sites. “By the 2040s,” said Adam Dorr, research director at the analytics firm RethinkX, “there will be almost nothing a robot can’t do better and cheaper than a human.” China already has more than 2 million of them working in factories, and the U.S. is rushing to catch up. In workplaces across America, robots are lifting boxes, transporting goods, even flipping burgers. At a Spanx warehouse outside Atlanta, humanoid bots pluck baskets of clothes from wheeled bots and set them on conveyor belts. To unpack trucks in several facilities, the shipping company DHL uses wheeled Stretch robots from Boston Dynamics, which can lift 50-pound boxes using flexible arms covered in vacuum suction cups. Just one can unload nearly 600 cases per hour, nearly double what humans can do. BMW just finished a pilot program in Spartanburg, S.C., where robot tasks included loading sheet metal parts into a welder. Even small firms are getting in on the action. Greg LeFevre is CEO of Raymath, a metal-fabrication company in Troy, Ohio. His factory is using 13 robot arms, supervised by his human employees, and he says the machines can work around the clock and can execute tricky aluminum welds “anywhere from two to six times faster” than a person. But it’s the nation’s second-largest private employer, Amazon, that is taking the biggest leap. It has a million robots working in various capacities and says some 75% of its global deliveries are assisted by robotics. At its 3-million-square-foot “next generation” facility in Shreveport, La., some 1,000 robots of various shapes and sizes shuttle pallets across floors, pluck items from storage bins, and load packages onto carts. Citing internal documents, The New York Times reported last month that Amazon is on track to replace some 600,000 jobs with robots in the coming years, even with sales projected to double by 2033. Its transformation will be closely watched, said Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor who studies automation. “Once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others too.” Escape your echo chamber.

Robot enthusiasts say the next frontier after warehouses and factories will be homes. The California robotics firm 1X Technologies is taking $20,000 preorders for its Neo robots, with expected delivery next year. The 5-foot, 6-inch humanoids—which currently require remote human operators to joystick them around but will eventually be autonomous—will not just clean toilets and load dishwashers. They’ll also be able to share jokes and engage in “lively, natural conversations,” says the firm. CEO Bernt Bornich believes users will rely on them for both cleaning and companionship. “I don’t think it’s another person, and it’s not a pet,” he said. “It’s something else.” There’s no question robots will take away some jobs, but the net effect is a matter of debate. Tech CEOs are quick to say that in fact new higher-skilled jobs will be created—like the position of robot wrangler—and that robots will largely fill dull jobs that most people don’t want. The bots unloading DHS trucks, for example, do “the most hated job in a warehouse,” said Marc Theermann of Boston Dynamics. But some scientists say the robot revolution is still far off, because the machines still have significant physical limitations. Those who think android plumbers and cooks will soon proliferate should “reset expectations,” said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at University of California, Berkeley. For one thing, it’s proved very hard to endow them with the dexterity to manipulate objects, such as “pick up a wine glass or change a light bulb,” he said. “No robot can do that.” Robot evangelists say yes. They say robots are learning so quickly that their advent will inevitably lead to labor-market upheaval. Kavin, a 27-year-old who helps train AI robots to fold clothes in India, says the humanoids aren’t perfect. “Sometimes the robot’s arms throw the clothes,” he says. “Sometimes it scatters the stack.” But he says they’re improving to the point where soon, “they’ll be able to do all the jobs, and there will be none left for us.” Anticipating pushback over mass layoffs, Amazon is reportedly developing plans to mitigate the fallout through community outreach, and other companies are commissioning studies on possible impacts. “We’re basically going to live in a world,” says Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure AI, “where any physical labor is a choice.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Feature A consummate history of capitalism and a memoir from the journalist who fell in love with RFK Jr. The Explainer The Trump administration is imposing new limits for federal student loans starting on July 1, 2026 TODAY’S BIG QUESTION Trump’s all-powerful gatekeeper is at the center of a MAGA firestorm that could shift the trajectory of the administration In the Spotlight Tariffs and cheaper rivals have displaced the innovative robot company Under the Radar Some say the machines help people mourn; others are skeptical Feature The tech mogul’s vision for virtual worlds inhabited by millions of users was clearly a flop Speed Read Kids under age 16 are now barred from platforms including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit Feature If you get a puzzling text message from a stranger, you may be the target of ‘pig butchering.’ The Week Recommends Advanced AI may have made slop videos harder to spot, but experts say it’s still possible to detect them Under the radar Pollution from Colossal looms over a small Southern town, potentially exacerbating health concerns feature Cloudflare was the latest in a string of outages The Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The New York Mets’ ballpark in Queens. A Bronx golf course once operated by President Donald Trump ’s company. A slot parlor on a horse racing track near John F. Kennedy International Airport. The three disparate sites, located far from the tourist hub of Manhattan, will become the future homes of New York City’s first Las Vegas-style resort casinos. The state Gaming Commission on Monday awarded the three projects licenses to operate in the lucrative metropolitan-area market during a meeting at a riverside park in upper Manhattan. The panel approved the licenses with the condition that the companies each appoint an outside monitor that would report regularly to the commission to ensure they meet their financial and legal obligations, as well as the promised investments they made to local communities. Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction.

The sale of March of Giants comes less than two months after Amazon said it had decided to "halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon's slow, shambolic withdrawal from mainstream videogame development continued apace with today's announcement that it has offloaded the free-to-play MOBA March of Giants, which is still in development, onto Ubisoft. The deal will also see Amazon Games Montreal, headed up by former Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis and Ubisoft Toronto managing director Alexandre Parizeau, join Ubisoft as part of its Montreal studio. "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle," said Marquis, the creative director on March of Giants. "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we're excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level." Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot shared similar sentiments, saying that March of Giants "has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas." "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players," Guillemot said. "We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Thrilled to have the March of Giants team join Ubisoft Montréal! These seasoned developers—many who built their careers here—are pushing boundaries with their competitive MOBA experience. Welcome! Full details here: https://t.co/XHree0iuqD pic.twitter.com/qN8HXWsEwnDecember 15, 2025 The MOBA genre can indeed be lucrative, if you happen to be the company that made League of Legends or Dota 2. For everyone else, it's more of a fistfight over the crumbs. Gigantic: Rampage Edition and Seekers of Skyveil both crashed out quickly after launch, and while Smite 2 continues to trundle along, Hi-Rez Studios has struggled badly with layoffs and game shutdowns over the past couple years. The only game with the potential to shake things up in the genre is Deadlock, almost entirely due to the fact it's being developed by Valve. The response to the March of Giants closed alpha in September might suggest that it's in for a similarly rough ride. Not that the reaction is overly negative, there just doesn't seem to be much of it at all: The "closed alpha recap" post, the most recent update, has drawn a total of six comments, and the game's Steam forum in general is largely devoid of activity; the March of Giants Discord seems similarly moribund. How likely it is that Ubisoft will be able to turn that around is anyone's guess, although the odds don't strike me as particularly great. But assuming it follows the LoL/Dota 2 pricing scheme, March of Giants does seem like it could be a good fit for Ubisoft's focus on live service games in the future. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amazon, meanwhile, hasn't completely stepped back from the videogame business. It remains committed to publishing the two new Tomb Raider games announced at The Game Awards 2025, and it also seemingly sees big things in AI-fuelled garbage like Courtroom Chaos Featuring Snoop Dog. This may not be a great time for Ubisoft to try busting into the MOBA biz, but at least it's better than that. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: After "gutting" its video game division, Amazon has sold one of its studios to Ubisoft

March of Giants rights also acquired. Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants. As per Ubisoft's announcement, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis, who joined Amazon in 2021 after leaving Ubisoft two years prior. As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game." "March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on Twitch. Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team." In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease, and word emerged suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned.

By MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot’s primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,” iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn’t expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31.

Title: Tomb Raider Devs Explain Why They’re Making Two Games At Once

Tomb Raider CatalystTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis At last weekâs Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics announced not one, but two Tomb Raider games. One is the next chapter in Lara Croftâs adventures, called Tomb Raider Catalyst; the other is a remake of the original game titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, the same company working on the Sophie Turner-led live-action series. All of this is in an effort to turn Lara into a multimedia superstar with multiple projects running under one roof. With Amazonâs known history of being terrible, fans are probably wondering how deeply its claws are stuck into the Tomb Raider series, and Crystal Dynamics has spoken a little bit about the partnership. In a group Q&A session that Kotaku was present for, Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos and game director Will Kerslake spoke about Amazonâs role in both the upcoming Tomb Raider games and the show. Tomb Raider has been a cross-media franchise for decades, with the Angelina Jolie films being some of the earliest examples of a video game adaptation doing well at the box office, but now Amazon and Crystal Dynamics are trying to make something interconnected, though Crystal Dynamics wouldnât confirm if Catalyst would be tied to the upcoming series when it launches in 2027. âOur Amazon partners have been tremendous,â Amos said. âFrom the beginning, they’ve gotten the idea of this vision we have for this cross-media franchise that crossed both the live-action things during the series and the two games that we’re making right now, but we’re not here to talk about any details and anything else in the future about the TV series until later on.â As far as how deep this partnership goes, Amos said collaborating with Amazonâs own set of creative directors, narrative writers, and producers has been like speaking into a âmirrorâ as the two groups have worked together to pave the way for the future of the series as this multimedia franchise, and that the team is meeting with Amazon folks âdaily,â including on-site visits from Amazon to run through the latest development milestones. âOn the development side, we have partners across all the different disciplines that we work with directly,â Kerslake said. âSo as a member of the dev team, it’s been great to have collaborative partners focused on the quality of the game that trust the team to find the answers to those problems.â By the time Tomb Raider Catalyst launches in 2027, it will have been nine years since the last mainline Tomb Raider game. Shadow of the Tomb Raider launched in 2018 to good but not great reviews, though it did eventually go on to sell over 8.9 million copies. Since then, Tomb Raider has had a lot of re-releases of old games. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is coming out before Catalyst, and this isnât even the first time the original game has been remade, as Tomb Raider: Anniversary also brought that first adventure to modern audiences back in 2007. When asked if Catalyst might be taking longer to come out because Crystal Dynamics is putting more resources into the remake, Amos said “absolutely not,â that the remake had been planned for the franchiseâs 30th anniversary next year and is being handled by a different team than Catalyst. Shadow Warrior developer Flying Wild Hog is working on Legacy of Atlantis, but Amos says the team is still âconnectedâ to Crystal Dynamics and the broader Tomb Raider development team. âWe actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets, but we have one leadership team, a visionary team over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling,â Amos said. Amos said the partnership was made possible by the Fellowship Entertainment subsidiary of the Embracer Group, which is one of the many arms of the company that houses its too-goddamn-many IP like Tomb Raider and Lord of the Rings. Consolidation of media aside, Amos says this partnership has allowed both teams to fully dedicate their time to their respective games in parallel development without siphoning resources from one another. After years of Tomb Raider games looking back at Laraâs survivalist origins, Catalyst is finally moving the timeline forward, though the studio says it has designed Catalyst so players can jump in with “no homework required.” Dragon Age and Assassinâs Creed actor Alix Wilton Regan is voicing the treasure hunter now, and the way Crystal Dynamics describes the game makes it sound like itâs a new era for her and the series, so perhaps a new voice is another sign of that. However, Crystal Dynamics has also made clear that this isnât another reboot or a different timeline. This is the same Lara Croft fans have known and loved for decades, just in a âdifferent timeâ in her life. So perhaps itâs not a bad time to revisit the original game and its more traditional action-adventure roots before finally nudging Lara forward after a decade of survivalist prequels.Â Crystal Dynamics has been put through the wringer over the past few years ever since Square Enix sold it off to Embracer Group, with layoffs happening as recently as last month. Itâs a damn shame those affected workers wonât be around to bring Catalyst past the finish line, but hopefully the end result is able to shine through all that inner turmoil when it launches in 2027.

Title: Reviewing My Wishes for 2026

Time Published: 2025-12-15T16:15:36Z
Full Content:
Here we are at the far end of 2025 and everything is both better and worse than I expected. The Year was 2025… and I was not prepared On the bad side of the ledger… I cannot even start to sum up what a disaster 2025 has been for the US. This is some real “end of the Roman republic” shit and everybody in power is just grabbing stuff for themselves, with naked corruption on display and nobody cares. Absolutely unprecedented criminal activity in plain sight by Republicans, who have decided the law doesn’t apply to them. This stuff only ends in dictatorship and we’re not even going to get an Augustus at this point, having gone straight to Nero with dementia and everybody has to donate to his causes and give him fake awards to in order to conduct business in the US. And it is all going to get worse as he ages and the corruption becomes a huge drag on the economy. Then the AI bubble is going to collapse, and then the real problems will start when CEOs don’t get their bonuses and start laying off even more people. So there is all that. On the bright side, personally, I still have a job, healthcare, and a home. We’re not struggling. Day to day things are still “normal.” Granted, we’re not buying anything either as the price of everything, from beef to blueberries, is going up and dinner for two at even a modest restaurant goes past $100 if we order a cocktail. But that Costco whole roasted chicken is still a deal. Anyway, I knew it was going to be bad so rather than doing predictions at the start of the year, I altered my annual tradition, wherein I feel obligated to foresee how things might go bad, and chose to go with a hopeful set of wishes. For those interested in the history of this routine, I have links! Of course I do! Now here we are in the back half of the last month of the year and it is time to do the accounting, to credit the universe for the wishes it granted and grumble about those it denied. For purposes of measurement, wishes have the usual 10 point value, with partial credit available for partial fulfillment, unless otherwise indicated in the wish. Are we ready? Let’s do this. 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Hah hah hah… no. Phil Spencer won’t be sufficiently motivated unless he gets an obscene bonus, which meant laying people off at XBox and elsewhere. I don’t know what he’ll do when he runs out of staff to lay off, but we’re getting closer to finding out. Zero points. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. Hah hah hah… no. In fact, things seems to be going in the opposite direction for Daybreak and EG7. Capital management firms want more stock buybacks and more dividend payments. There will be no investment in the future. Zero points. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. Okay, this was a gimme for 2025. I am not so sure it will be for 2026 though. 10 points. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. I didn’t even believe this back in January, so no surprises here with zero points. It is only disappointing because ArenaNet managed to do something for original Guild Wars. Hell, they added controller support. 5 – Commit To or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Again, wish denied. EG7 keeps hyping H1Z1 as an important first party title in its financials, but has done nothing with it. Zero points. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. I mean, we are technically getting housing in 2025. It showed up last week. But I couldn’t tell you if they messed it up. The previews got some shade from people with no investment in the game while the current fan boys have declared it to be everything anybody could ever want plus a bag of chips. Still, if the fans aren’t revolting, Works for the true believers even if the non-invested seem less than impressed, so I guess they didn’t mess up completely. Give me… erm, the universe… 6 points on this one while the jury is still out in the long term. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace Hah hah hah… no. Blizz seems to be actively sabotaging WoW Classic at this point. Expansions running way too long, modern features being shoehorned into old content, and the heavy hands of monetization are all weighing on the experience. I am expecting somebody in Blizz leadership to revive the J. Allen Brack quote about thinking you want classic and declare that he was right all along… or announce a new version of vanilla with Dungeon Finder, achievements, WoW Tokens, and a cash shop. Anyway, zero points here. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new Fuck no. That might impact Phil Spencer’s bonus. And I thought Bobby Kotick was bad, but he at least found space in the budget for some new titles. Zero points. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access Nope. Still three devs in a yurt grinding out code on stone tablets. Zero points. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access Now I am just going start getting angry. This isn’t even a real project. Zero points, though I feel like it should get negative points for being such a psych. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on Sure, at least Sean Murray and crew are still working on that. Corvettes were awesome. 10 points. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles Not really. It will be a few years before it is playable and they figure out people don’t like to be ganked by ornothoptors or whatever all day long. Still, it runs. Maybe 4 points. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving It seemed to do well for most of the year. Then Amazon decided to stop supporting third party platforms to favor their own Luna AI offerings. Still, for most of the year GoG.com was doing well. Call it 8 points. 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy No. They either don’t know or cannot admit as much. Things are “better” but how much was them just cranking the dials at random until some metric went up? The price of PLEX is down 25% since its 2025 peak. Good for buyers, but bad for sellers. I’ll give the universe 4 points for at least the Mineral Price Index going down finally, though does that mean they fixed something or that there is some other problem? 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Nope. Zero points. Next. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title Hah hah hah… no. They either want a late 90s FPS or a blockchain scam title. Nothing people will pay to play for fun. Zero points. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Wasted a wish on that as well. Zero points. 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done I should just lay off New Eden. Burnout and ill health has put a damper on progress. Zero points. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Mein Gott, enough already. I mean, we did get a few minutes of war. PanFam did occasionally fight back as we rolled east and up to their boarder… then the core of the coalition, Pandemic Horde, collapsed and ran away and eventually folded into The Initiative, so we spent a few weeks blowing up structures unopposed, random hero structure gunners not forgotten. While that is an element of many wars in New Eden, that wasn’t the was we wanted. Call it 3 points, one for each Keepstar they at least tried to defend. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News Yeah no… the money was on the original Guild Wars being remastered I guess. Who knew? Zero points. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll Yes, this seems to be going well. It is a little rough at every major update, but it gets worked out, and there is a 1.0 target for next spring. 10 points. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach I want to be charitable and say yes, it did expand. But it still feels years away from any vision Raph was spinning back when he was going on about design pillars. I am sure the underlying code has improved, but the actual play tests feel like they did a year back, just with more restrictions. My fault for having expectations and expecting more from the universe when it grants wishes. Call it 5 points. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 Do I get triple points because it went to level 80? I am going to dissect the essence of this wish, which was for a 10 level raise in the level cap. And, sure enough, everybody who was level 50 went straight to level 70, leaving them 10 more levels to work on. It kind of worked out if you squint at it real hard. I am claiming 10 points for the universe on this one. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake Nope. Zero points. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. The cut off date for wishes is December 15. Zero points. Hardly a surprise this failed to pan out given the Mark Jacobs track record for the last 20 years. 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck It became a live service, game pass, drip updates, buy the new shiny of the month style of game to rival even the most annoying Paradox title. It made a splash for a month or two then disappeared from sight. 2 points for the effort. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Hah, no! Zero points. See you next year! 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Nope, Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down revealed instead. Zero points. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominated and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real What was I even thinking? Gabe isn’t buying mega yachts off of developing games, just on taxing developers selling games on his platform. This guy might be the least worst rich gaming CEO or executive, and he is still fucking miserable. Half Life 3 will never happen. Zero points. But what if he is just holding it back as a launch title for the GabeCube? Better draft it in FCL again this year, just in case! Summing Up So, if all wishes had been granted, it would have been worth 300 points, there being 30 wishes and 10 points a piece. Unless my ability to count is seriously impaired, three passes down the list all came up with 82 points scored. That gives the universe about a 27% wish fulfillment rate, counting partials. The universe is about on par with my average year’s ability to guess. So it goes. This was my 18th round of guesses over the life of the blog. Time to get ready for the 19th. For 2026 it will be all predictions. Then maybe I for the 20th can sum up how well I have done over the years in total, maybe pulling out my most unlikely guesses that came true… though that sounds like work. We’ll see. Anyway, look for the next round showing up at a January 1st 2026 near you! Gaming (or maybe just my relationship with it) was weird this year. On the one hand, I played a ton of games I really enjoyed, so I can’t fairly say it was a ‘bad’ year. On the other hand, I played mostly the same games this year that I did last year (League of Legends, TableTopSim for 40k, Rimworld), with some ‘new’ games like FFT:remaster in the mix. The list of truly new games released that I thought were awesome? Pretty short. LikeLike For the record, I think a better bet next year would be that Microsoft would pawn XBox off to some Private Equity Firm ™, which means that all of those game studios will implode within 4-5 years. Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and WoW won’t save Bethesda and Blizzard from a potential bad end, since the PE Firm will only want Call of Duty and mobile games. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. Would Clair Obscure count as well? LikeLike Oh, but why sell it off when you could force AI into everything to help justify setting billions of dollars on fire on that front? Plenty of options on the table. And yes, I CO33 would count as well. I wrote most of this before the game awards so that wasn’t front and center in my mind having won all the awards. LikeLike I know it’s after the cut-off, but apparently LOTRO just announced that UI scaling is coming with its next patch. (Saw someone posting about it on Bluesky.) LikeLike I’ll be interested to see what they have. They acknowledged scaling as an issue back in 2016 and have talked about it off and on, but they have not delivered much on that front. LikeLike Regarding #12 – I can‘t comment on anything Conan Exiles related as I haven‘t played that, but Dune is very much „playable“ right now. Even if you‘re a lot quicker than I was to reach the deep desert you‘ll still have at least 50 hours of well designed, awesome (in my opinion, obviously) content ahead of you until there‘s even a chance of running into any griefing-related problems. Personally, I got over 200 very enjoyable hours out of the game. No sign of griefing during any of them, btw. LikeLike I will admit that I only read the patch notes at this point, and they read a lot like early Conan Exiles update, which at least confirmed my “they never learn” take. I plan to play at some point, but the group is currently off on another side adventure. LikeLike Whatever LoTRO has coming it’s already on the test server. According to Reddit, it works pretty well. That will teach you to give up on your wishes too soon! Maybe the game industry will correct itself and start treating their employees well in the next two weeks ;-) LikeLiked by 1 person Hey man, the rule is always December 15th or bust.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Fremantle is closing Don’t Pick up the Phone maker Wag Entertainment’s production arm, with MD Steven Green exiting after 26 years. Fremantle acquired Wag last year when it bought owner Asacha Media Group and we understand the move comes as part of ongoing strategic planning related to Asacha. Wag Entertainment’s distribution arm, which is run by Janice Strangward, is staying put, and Wag’s IP remains with Fremantle. Green is leaving along with co-founder Eliya Arman, creative director Bridget Boseley, production boss Kate Gibbard and production manager Kelly Hood. Layoffs are in the single figures, we are told.

The latter came via an innovative streaming model that saw Paramount+ take UK rights and Netflix rest of world. Upcoming, Wag’s Secrets of the Conclave airs on the BBC in a week’s time. Watch on Deadline Wag was acquired by Asacha in 2021, at which point founder Martin Durkin left and was replaced by Green. Fremantle has been strategizing over the future of Asacha since it bought the firm in 2024 and both Asacha founders have since exited. Green said the Wag team “leaves on a high” after making projects during the past year for Amazon, Paramount+ and a trio of British broadcasters. “Everyone at Wag is proud of what we’ve achieved, and this year’s success, as well as the success of the past two and half decades, is all down to the many talented people we’ve worked with,” he added. “So on behalf of Eliya, Bridget, Kate and Kelly, a heartfelt thank you to all the freelancers and staffers, past and present, for 26 brilliant years.” Fremantle UK CEO Amelia Brown said: “We would like to say a huge thank you to Steven and the team for their incredible work and achievements. Wag has made great contributions to Fremantle since its successful integration under Asacha Media Group last year. We wish all the team at WAG the very best in their future endeavours.” Asacha, and now Fremantle, owns the likes of Death in Paradise producer Red Planet Pictures, Magic of Disney’s Animal Kingdom maker Arrow and Oscar-nominated Les Misérables producer SRAB. Fremantle owner RTL previously said the super-indie spent more than €200M ($234M) on Asacha and 80% of Singapore’s Beach House Pictures in 2024.

Title: Gaskin: End of DOGE marks missed AI opportunity
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/14/gaskin-end-of-doge-marks-missed-ai-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T08:02:31Z
Full Content:
In late November, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quietly disbanded months ahead of schedule, with senior officials confirming that the agency “no longer exists” in any centralized form. Its end marks not only the collapse of a widely publicized initiative but one of the greatest missed opportunities of the Trump administration. At a moment when artificial intelligence was transforming nearly every major industry, the federal government had a rare chance to reinvent itself. Instead, it stepped backward. When DOGE launched in January 2025, President Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk — a global technology figure — as the program’s celebrity face. With its rhetoric of trillion-dollar savings and sweeping modernization, DOGE could have become the most ambitious public-sector innovation project in American history. Yet instead of using Musk’s technological expertise — and especially artificial intelligence — to modernize federal operations, streamline public services, and build a new digital foundation for government, DOGE quickly devolved into old-school mass layoffs and headline-friendly cuts. Estimates from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, and the OECD suggest that 40% to 60% of all jobs could be reshaped by AI, but the administration traded a once-in-a-generation modernization opportunity for a chainsaw. DOGE’s most dramatic action was the firing of an estimated 280,000 federal employees in a matter of months. This created the impression of sudden efficiency, but it reflected a deeper strategic failure: DOGE chose subtraction over transformation. Programs that were ripe for AI augmentation — veterans’ claims processing, Social Security workflows, IRS casework, public-health analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory review — were not redesigned or modernized. They were simply downsized, often in ways that made the remaining work slower, more expensive, and less secure. Agencies were forced to rehire many of the same workers as contractors. Anti-fraud programs that recovered more money than they cost were shut down entirely. And when DOGE abruptly ended FDA and EPA user-fee programs, Congress had to pass emergency appropriations to keep essential operations running. The most significant loss, however, was not financial — it was the opportunity to use AI to rebuild government for the next generation. Rather than accelerating federal performance, DOGE slowed it down as agencies confronted aging systems, soaring service demands, and rapidly escalating cybersecurity threats. Entire cybersecurity teams were dismantled just as AI-powered attacks were multiplying worldwide. Public disputes between Musk and senior officials — often amplified across social media — further undermined morale and trust. The disruption was damaging, but the deeper tragedy was the transformation that never even began. This failure is especially stark when contrasted with an earlier and far more successful modernization effort. From 1993 to 2000, Vice President Al Gore led the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), the largest and most effective government reform initiative of the modern era. NPR delivered verified, inflation-adjusted savings of roughly $300 billion, but its true success lay in how those savings were achieved. Gore’s approach was methodical rather than theatrical. NPR modernized processes, digitized operations, reduced administrative layers, strengthened customer service, and embedded reforms through bipartisan legislation such as the Government Performance and Results Act. Workforce changes were handled through attrition, early retirements, and voluntary buyouts — not mass firings — allowing reforms to be stable, sustainable, and non-polarizing. NPR built capacity. DOGE dismantled it. DOGE could have used its mandate to invite the world’s leading AI organizations — OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI, Google Research, Microsoft AI, Amazon AWS AI, Apple AI, xAI, Mistral, Nvidia, and Cohere — to compete to solve the government’s hardest operational challenges. Such a competition could have produced multilingual digital assistants for the American public, AI copilots for federal workers, advanced fraud-detection engines capable of saving billions, AI-accelerated code modernization tools, stronger cybersecurity, and dramatically reduced backlogs across veterans’ services, Social Security, and tax processing. These tools could have been interoperable, reusable, and transferable across both the public and private sectors. DOGE could have launched the first AI-powered reinvention of the federal government — and instead, it chose elimination over innovation. By the time DOGE dissolved, the opportunity was gone. The United States was left with a federal workforce that was not more modern, not more efficient, and in critical areas, significantly weaker. The death of DOGE is not fundamentally about missed cost savings. It is the story of a historic opportunity squandered. Modernizing government does not require chainsaws, celebrity feuds, or ideological crusades. It requires vision, collaboration, technological expertise, and respect for the institutional knowledge necessary to implement change responsibly. Above all, it requires a commitment to building. Had DOGE embraced an AI-first strategy, the United States might today be leading the world in digital governance, offering faster services, safer systems, and more transparent operations. Instead, DOGE stands as a cautionary tale — a reminder that spectacular claims are no substitute for serious reform. As policymakers consider the next chapter of government modernization, they would do well to study Al Gore’s quiet, durable NPR — and imagine what might be possible if today’s most advanced AI labs were finally invited to help build the future of American government.
