Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Δ Seven snapshots reveal how climate rollbacks altered the trajectory of U.S. energy, environmental protection, and economic security. In just one year, President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed the arc of federal climate and environmental policy. Upon returning to office 12 months ago, Trump immediately declared an “energy emergency” and promised to “unleash American energy.” He packed his cabinet with oil executives and climate skeptics who have since rolled back the climate initiatives and protections of presidents Obama and Biden while accelerating fossil fuel development. From dismantling regulations designed to cut emissions and tame pollution to repealing the country’s most ambitious climate action, Trump has reveled in reversing years of progress. He has withdrawn from both the Paris Agreement and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and undercut scientific research at every opportunity. This retrenchment came even as much of the world moved forward in 2025. Worldwide, renewables provided 40 percent of all electricity. Coal-fired power generation declined in India and China for the first time in two generations. Global clean energy investment was 50 percent higher than fossil fuel investment. Still, the United States has clearly ceded leadership in the climate fight. These seven charts reflect a year with implications that will be felt for a long time to come. Grist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How The first year of Trump 2.0 brought sweeping changes to Washington’s view of electric vehicles, and American automakers felt the squeeze. President Donald Trump and Congress took several steps to eliminate federal support for it, including eliminating the $7,500 consumer tax credit. The administration also slashed fuel-economy targets — from about 50 mpg by 2031 to roughly 35 — and eliminated penalties for automakers that miss efficiency standards. The combined effect: higher prices for many electric vehicles built in the United States, uncertainty around battery and manufacturing investments, and a weaker regulatory push that now favors hybrids and conventional vehicles. EV market share in the country, which briefly topped 10 percent in the third quarter as buyers rushed to claim the expiring credit, has since fallen to single digits. Meanwhile, the global EV industry continues to accelerate, making the U.S. retreat look like a concession to China — and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Chinese industrial policy continues driving down costs, with industry giants CATL and BYD now supplying more than half of the world’s batteries. BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s best-selling EV manufacturer, selling 2.26 million cars in 2025 compared to Tesla’s 1.64 million. In the United States, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down, killed the F-150 Lightning pickup, and planned a pivot toward hybrids, citing federal policy changes as the primary driver. There was one bright spot in the data, though: The price gap between used internal combustion and electric vehicles is rapidly narrowing, and as of August it reached a record low of just $897. A glut of used EVs are also expected to hit the market over the next few years, which could drive prices down even further. So: The first year of Trump’s second term hasn’t exactly decimated the American EV industry, but it has transformed what might have been a sustained industrial policy push into a landscape of slow growth, rapid market shifts, and further consolidation of China’s manufacturing and battery supply chains.

Here's How – Clayton Aldern, senior data reporter One of the more counterintuitive aspects of climate change is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions often requires more energy, not less. That’s because of electrification: Technologies like induction stoves, heat pumps for homes and factories, and electric cars all draw the grid. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence requires ever more power-hungry data centers, further straining the electrical system. Yet in the first year of its second term, the Trump administration did everything in its power to slow the rollout of renewables like wind and solar, and even stalled several offshore wind projects already under development — even as rising electricity demand made them increasingly necessary. But even against these political headwinds, green energy continued to surge. States like California and Texas kept expanding solar, wind, and storage capacity, showing that market economics outweigh federal roadblocks. Electricity demand in the United States grew 3.1 percent last year, according to energy think tank Ember. At the same time, solar generation rose by 27 percent, meeting nearly two-thirds of that extra demand. Utilities have also been building huge battery banks to store that juice for use when the sun isn’t shining: California added nearly 70 percent more storage capacity in 2024 than the year before. While it will take time to suss out the Trump administration’s impact on this energy transition, it’s clear that market forces remain a powerful driver for states that understand that a cleaner grid is a cheaper, more reliable grid. – Matt Simon, senior staff writer The Federal Emergency Management Agency often makes headlines during disasters, but in recent years it also has spent billions helping hundreds of communities prepare for future catastrophes. The agency has long doled out grants to alleviate floods in low-lying areas and weatherize against storms, and under the Biden administration it launched new programs to build resilience against climate-fueled threats like wildfires and extreme heat. These programs have provided money to elevate thousands of homes in low-lying areas, manage flammable vegetation, and upgrade sewers to handle runoff from freak storms. That effort came to a stop earlier this year after Trump vowed to shrink federal spending. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced all FEMA payments above $100,000 would require her approval, reportedly creating a billion-dollar backlog of transactions. Quarterly spending on the program fell from a peak of around $500 million under Biden to less than zero last year as FEMA clawed back money from some recipients. The agency also has halted all new approvals for resilience projects. FEMA has continued to endorse new projects that don’t have an explicit climate focus, like installing backup generators and drafting disaster response plans, but it has shut down the Biden-era Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which funded long-term investments to reduce climate-related risks. FEMA does not appear to have approved a single project under that program since Trump’s inauguration, despite a federal court ruling in December ordering it to continue the program. – Jake Bittle, staff writer The country’s bedrock environmental laws are only as strong as their enforcement. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, working alongside their state counterparts, are responsible for protecting the public and holding polluters accountable. But over the past year, the Trump administration has dismantled those agencies with sweeping layoffs and budget cuts, undercutting their ability to fulfill their missions. More than 11,500 employees of the two agencies have been laid off or resigned, including dozens from enforcement divisions. That’s left fewer federal inspectors to track pollution and fewer attorneys to pursue violators. That pullback is already reshaping how often — and how forcefully — the government goes after polluters. Over the first nine months of both Trump’s first term and the Biden presidency, the Justice Department launched roughly 40 civil enforcement cases against polluters. During the same stretch last year, it initiated just 11. The slowdown extends to prosecutions as well. Under the previous two administrations, the number of consent decrees resulting from federal cases typically hovered around 50. Last year, that figure fell to just 24, weakening one of the federal government’s most effective tools for forcing cleanup and compliance. The retreat deepens a decades-long erosion in regulatory oversight. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, many state environmental agencies — which carry out much of the day-to-day enforcement of such laws — have seen their funding for that work slashed. Between 2010 and 2024, those budgets declined in more than half of all U.S. states, and by more than one-third in at least seven. With federal enforcement budgets also being reduced, oversight is shrinking at every level of government. – Naveena Sadasivam, senior staff writer Delivering on his campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill,” President Trump, during his inaugural address, signaled a sweeping overhaul of federal land management. Later that day, he declared a national energy emergency and promised to fast-track domestic energy production and infrastructure “from coast to coast.” The directive marked a profound shift in the management of public land and coastal waters, with the goal of rapidly expanding fossil fuel development. In the year since, the Trump administration has targeted roughly 88 million acres that were once set aside for recreation and conservation, opening them for oil and gas development and logging. At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management, responsible for managing public lands for multiple uses and long-term sustainability, has held 22 lease sales and approved 6,027 new oil and gas permits, the highest number since 2010, according to the Center for American Progress. Some of the nation’s most sensitive landscapes are now at risk of development. The administration has, for example, moved to end protections for Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which covers 19 million acres. Other threatened areas include forestland in the Boundary Waters region of Minnesota, the high desert mesas and canyons surrounding New Mexico’s Chaco Culture National Historical Park, approximately 58 million acres of roadless wilderness throughout the national forest system, and roughly 87 million acres of unique habitat for threatened and endangered species. These moves put ecosystems, wildlife, cultural sites, and communities at risk, transforming land once preserved for the public good into resources to be exploited by industry. – Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco, Midwest regional climate reporter The Inflation Reduction Act set aside about $2 billion to underwrite clean energy and climate resilience projects for tribal nations. The Trump administration has slashed funding for such work, leaving communities scrambling for alternatives and undermining progress toward their energy sovereignty. The federal grants and incentives helped tribes build solar farms, develop microgrids, expand battery storage, and advance climate-adaptation projects on their lands. For many communities, these initiatives weren’t just about clean energy, but providing a service people elsewhere take for granted. Tribal households face 6.5 times more outages than the U.S. average and a 28 percent higher energy burden. Roughly 54,000 residents of tribal lands lack electricity entirely. Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed or frozen programs, including a $20 million grant to an Alaska village fighting coastal erosion, and, among other actions, threatened the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that had promised $3 billion to 350 recipients. Without that backing, projects have stalled or teetered on collapse, leaving communities scrambling for private funding, philanthropic support, or loans to keep them moving forward. These cuts do more than slow the clean energy transition. They threaten Indigenous sovereignty, economic opportunity, and resilience to climate change. Tribal nations are having to reconsider their plans, seek new financing, and defend projects that were years in the making. As Washington pulls back, they are pushing forward, but the stakes for their communities, their lands, and their self-determination could not be higher. — Miacel Spotted Elk, Indigenous Affairs fellow For the nation’s farmers, 2025 was defined by uncertainty and mounting expenses as President Trump’s trade war reshaped agricultural markets. A protectionist agenda that his administration said would protect workers and lower costs instead left growers — particularly those who raise commodities like soybeans — with fewer buyers, higher bills, and an uncertain labor market. In February, Trump announced 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China, along with 25 percent levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico. Further duties followed in April. China retaliated with a 34 percent tax on products from the United States; in May, it stopped buying U.S. soybeans altogether. The escalating trade war with one of the country’s biggest markets for agricultural exports hit soybean and other commodity farmers hard. It didn’t help that Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum led to higher prices for farm equipment. China resumed purchasing U.S. soybeans in October, shortly before Trump announced the two countries had reached a trade deal. But prior to that, the Asian superpower had turned to other soybean producers, including Brazil and Argentina. That move has grave environmental implications. Production of the legume is a major contributor to deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado, a biodiverse savannah in central Brazil. Last month, Trump announced $12 billion in bridge payments to help farmers recover from the financial losses they’ve incurred. However, U.S. agricultural trade groups say it doesn’t go far enough to compensate farmers and reassure them that their livelihoods won’t rocked by future trade scuffles. — Frida Garza, staff writer A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Six things to know about Germany's job market in 2026

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Headlines about job cuts, the struggling economy and layoffs sparked by AI are common at the moment. But how is the German job market faring and what can we expect in 2026? Whether you are looking for a job, want to change industries or have your eye on Germany as a place to find new career opportunities, we've rounded up some trends affecting the job market this year. Workers want job security It's fair to say that Germany's labour market hasn't exactly been thriving of late – and unfortunately, this is expected to continue. The number of job vacancies has almost halved since its peak in 2022, and is even lower than pre-Covid times. "What is particularly dramatic is that fewer new jobs are being advertised than ever before," Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), told German business newspaper Handelsblatt in a report earlier in January. This makes it a difficult market and means that many people are prioritising stable positions rather than giving up a job they don't like to or going freelance. "Employees are looking for reliable conditions," said labour market expert Julius Probst from recruitment portal Stepstone. Jobs that offer security are therefore likely to remain highly competitive in 2026, especially if they come with a decent salary and the opportunity to work flexibly. READ ALSO: Five hard truths foreign jobseekers need to know Remote/flexible working is not as easy When it comes to flexible working, employees may have to take a step back in 2026. The range of remote work options is declining slightly, studies by the job portal Indeed suggest, with employers having the upper hand. According to the latest data, flexible arrangements are only offered in around 14.1 percent of all job advertisements at the moment, with flexible working hours only offered in 19 percent. At the beginning of 2025, the proportion of jobs offering 'home office' options was 14.7 percent, while 20.2 percent of ads mentioned flexible working hours. It may be because more roles where in-person attendance is required are being advertised. These include sectors like construction, health, care and defence, where remote work and flexibility are difficult to implement. The takeaway is: it's not impossible but remote working isn't as accessible. "Working from home is changing from the norm to a negotiable benefit," said Virginia Sondergeld, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. This is a tend seen across the world as many managers have implemented mandatory office attendance following relaxed rules during the pandemic era. READ ALSO: Where most jobs are expected to be cut in 2026 AI is important – but it's not wiping out all jobs in Germany Unless you've been living under a rock, you'll be aware that everyone is talking about generative AI, known as KI (Künstliche Intelligenz) in German. So how is AI affecting the labour market in Germany? Several companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, which employ people in Germany, have cited AI as the main reason for recent redundancies. But it's not all bad news. "While the number of job ads is declining overall in areas such as marketing, HR and project management, the demand for AI skills in these very professions is exploding," said Sondergeld. Importantly, we're not seeing mass layoffs across the board. A recent study by the IAB found that AI could see 800,000 jobs lost by 2040, but the same study said AI will create around 800,000 new jobs during the same period. The IAB study authors said the technology could even help increase Germany's GDP by 0.8 percentage points annually. Enzo Weber described AI as "the technology of our time that can be used across all areas". He added: "It will take on more and more tasks, but there will be a transformation in the job market, not a collapse.” Meanwhile, economist Julius Probst said jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills will not be affected. It essentially means an understanding of AI will be important in 2026, but it's not needed everywhere. Career changers are in demand as worker shortage grows If you've been looking to take on new skills or move to a different sector altogether, now is the time. As The Local has reported, Quereinsteiger (career-changers) are in demand. These people enter a new profession without the traditional qualifications and experience from that field. READ ALSO: Why demand for 'career changers' is rising sharply in Germany But that's exactly why they are sought after. HR managers like that they bring their experience and perspectives from other industries. With Germany facing an ever-growing shortage of skilled workers, there are plenty of opportunities out there for those willing to be flexible. Many companies are moving toward skills-based hiring: hiring practices that value practical skills over formal qualifications. "In 2026, for the first time, fewer people will be entering the labour market in Germany than leaving it," said economist Probst. "This is another reason why skills are becoming more important than formal qualifications." International workers are needed Speaking of the labour shortage, 2026 will also see red tape eased in a bid to attract foreigners with in-demand skills to Germany. The new Work and Stay Agency, due to launch this year and be implemented over the coming years, is expected to offer faster procedures, clearer guidance and a single point of contact for people looking to live and work in the country. Billed as a “one-stop government”, it will link visa offices, the Federal Employment Agency and local immigration authorities. The coalition government initiative is a response to Germany’s shifting demographics, as a wave of retirements shrinks the workforce and deepens pressure on the economy and social security system. READ ALSO: The planned changes to immigration and citizenship in Germany in 2026 Wages are rising and becoming more transparent In January, Germany's minimum wage rose by 8.4 percent. "This is having a particular impact in low-wage sectors such as catering and agriculture," said Weber. And even employees who earn more can expect an increase, albeit a small one. "Wages have recently risen by almost five percent. However, the increase will be smaller because the economic situation is difficult and the days of high inflation compensation are over," added Weber. Wage transparency will also be an important issue in 2026. EU member states must implement the EU Pay Transparency Directive into national law by June 7th, 2026. German companies need to catch up. Employers will soon have to tell applicants the starting salary or salary range either in the job ad or before the first interview. Employees can also request information about their individual pay and the average pay for comparable jobs (broken down by gender).

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years. The AI boom hasn’t quite managed that—it has experienced a gain of around 130 percent over the past three years—but three years is already longer than most of these historic booms. If AI is a bubble that’s going to bust, then it’s almost past due going by historic trends. All the major AI companies have announced their deals and are starting to make them reality. We aren’t going to see new rounds of trillion-dollar deals from even the major tech firms, as even they have limits on the capital they have available to them. But scaling up to these grandiose goals of AI data centers all over the world is proving difficult. After buying up all the GPUs and memory they can, some of these companies are still struggling to bring them online. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in November that the company now had a power problem, meaning it had GPUs that couldn’t physically plug in because it lacked the power to run them. And then you have Elon Musk’s xAI trying to import a power station (no, really) and supersonic jet company Boom Supersonic converting its jet engines into gas generators (no, really!). AI needs power, but power is at a premium. Power stations and their associated grid infrastructures take years or even decades to build. When power supply fails to catch up to their ambitions, it’s going to slam the brakes on expansion. A slowdown like that is the last thing the AI industry needs to keep its hype train rolling. No one likes Grok’s deepfakes and child exploitation images. Fake frames in Nvidia-run games are making gamers feel like they’re not really playing their games. AI-driven memory shortages and associated price spikes for everyday tech products are driving people crazy. Dell Companies are noticing and already pivoting, too. The most stark example so far this year is Dell relaunching its XPS brand at CES 2026. Sure, it’s still a “Copilot+ PC,” but you’d never know it from the marketing. AI is gone from the forefront and back is the focus on longevity, everyday performance, and lightweight design—you know, the things that consumers actually care about. If no one’s even interested in buying AI, how are these companies ever going to make it profitable? That’s not something investors are going to want to see or hear this year. On top of all the internal AI industry factors that could bring about its fall, there’s also global instability that could just as likely to deal a death blow. The US administration’s volatile leadership keeps throwing up (and tearing down) trade barriers. Hardware nationalization and nationalism are driving secular investments rather than global branch-outs. TSMC And as the superpowers keep eyeing up what their neighbors have, there’s the risk of war stalling out the world economy. Just China closing off Taiwan’s access to global markets would be enough to collapse just about everything in the tech sphere. Hopefully nothing like that comes to pass, but the prospect of it is one more Sword of Damocles hanging over the AI industry. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft won’t collapse. OpenAI probably won’t collapse. But the AI hype train of today could be heavily derailed. The smaller and medium AI companies, and all the firms promising agentic revolutions for your business? They’ll be gone. Stock prices will collapse, and global recession could be the medium-term fallout that eventually corrects everything back to some semblance of normalcy. Long term, though, even the companies that remain will have to contend with hardware deprecation that’ll see them scurrying back to Nvidia every 2 to 3 years. Even with all that hardware power, none of these companies are going to reach AGI (or even super-intelligence) with large language models that can’t functionally understand anything. AI is here to stay, but the industry as it is can’t last much longer. The signs are there that 2026 could be the year it all changes—again.

Macy's will close two fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, eliminating nearly 1,000 jobs by August 2026. The closures are part of a broader corporate strategy to streamline operations and centralize functions. The retailer has been a top-ten employer in Cheshire since 1986, marking a significant economic blow to the community. Local and state agencies are coordinating job fairs and transition resources for displaced workers. The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative.

The move follows other recent distribution center closures as Macy's pursues a cost-saving initiative. In a significant restructuring of its logistics network, the iconic American retailer Macyâs Inc. will shutter two major fulfillment centers in Cheshire, Connecticut, resulting in the permanent elimination of nearly 1,000 jobs. The phased layoffs, set to begin in March and conclude by late August 2026, deliver a severe economic blow to a community where the department store chain has been a cornerstone employer for four decades. This decision underscores the persistent pressures on traditional retail as companies aggressively streamline supply chains to improve profitability in an era dominated by e-commerce and shifting consumer habits. The scope of the Cheshire closure According to official notices filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the closures will affect 993 employees at facilities on Knotter Drive and West Johnson Avenue. The job cuts will occur in waves, starting with night operations and talent acquisition personnel on March 14, 2026. Subsequent rounds will impact part-time and full-time weekend and day-shift workers through the spring and summer, with a final group, including maintenance staff, ending employment on Aug. 29, 2026. A small maintenance team will remain until spring 2027 to manage the decommissioning process. Macyâs stated it will offer severance, benefits information and the possibility of transfers to other locations for affected workers. A decades-long community anchor is removed The human and economic impact extends far beyond the corporate balance sheet. Town officials expressed profound disappointment, noting Macyâs has been one of Cheshireâs top ten employers since it opened the fulfillment center in 1986. The town is collaborating with the Northwest Regional Workforce Board and the Connecticut Department of Labor to organize a job fair and provide transition resources for the displaced workforce. The ripple effect is already felt by local businesses, such as nearby restaurants and shops that have relied on Macyâs employees as regular customers for generations. Part of a broader corporate contraction The Cheshire shutdown is not an isolated event. It follows an October 2025 announcement to close a Macyâs distribution center in South Windsor, Connecticut, affecting another 150 jobs, and plans to shutter a fulfillment center in Oklahoma. The company frames these moves as essential components of its âBold New Chapterâ strategy, aimed at modernizing its supply chain, centralizing specific operations like its off-price Backstage business in Columbus, Ohio, and achieving $235 million in cost savings this year. This retrenchment mirrors a longer-term trend for the retailer, which has periodically closed underperforming stores and fulfillment centers over the past decade to adapt to declining mall traffic and intense online competition. The evolution of retail logistics The consolidation of distribution networks reflects a pivotal moment in retail history. For decades, large department stores like Macyâs operated extensive networks of regional fulfillment and distribution centers to stock physical stores efficiently. The rise of e-commerce giants, led by Amazon, revolutionized consumer expectations for delivery speed, forcing traditional retailers to overhaul their logistics models. Many are now moving toward fewer, more automated fulfillment hubs designed for direct-to-consumer shipping, often at the expense of older facilities built for a different era of retail. This transition, while a business necessity, frequently results in workforce reductions in long-established communities. Key elements of the modern retail supply chain shift include: Centralization of operations into high-tech hubs. Increased automation to handle e-commerce volume. A strategic focus on markets with the highest customer density. The closure of redundant or inefficient legacy facilities. Navigating the transition As the layoffs proceed, the focus in Connecticut turns to mitigation. The coordinated response from local and state agencies highlights the critical role of public-private partnerships in addressing large-scale job displacement. The planned job fair and access to retraining programs will be vital for workers whose skills are specialized to warehouse and logistics operations. The outcome in Cheshire will serve as a case study for how regional economies can respond to the ongoing structural changes in the retail and logistics sectors. An enduring challenge for the modern economy The closure of Macyâs Cheshire fulfillment centers is more than a corporate restructuring note; it is a localized manifestation of the relentless evolution of American retail. While Macyâs strategic pivot may bolster its financial resilience in a competitive market, it leaves a profound void in a community that relied on it for stable employment. The event underscores the enduring tension between corporate efficiency and community stability, a challenge that will continue to define the landscape of work and commerce in towns across the country as the digital transformation of the economy marches forward.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept. Few are going to miss it. As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices. In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more. Meta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets. Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. And last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well. The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers. Unlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending. Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate. That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments. Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores. “This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.” He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030. Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size. Though there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity. From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta. For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.) But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more. Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely. In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior. At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached. These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.” Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!) Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.) With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

Time Published: 2026-01-19T14:41:41Z

As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, said Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in 2025. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The health care sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create among the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, told Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson said. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

Title: Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicks off reelection campaign

Teamsters President Sean O’Brien kicked off a 2026 reelection bid in Charlestown on Sunday — defending his record, speaking to the future and warning his opponent that Teamsters politics are a “full contact sport.” “We need a full court press going into Las Vegas in June,” said O’Brien to a lively packed crowd of supporters. “We’re going to send a message. Send a message that we are united, and we are ready to fight. And our opponents need to understand, it’s a full contact sport. They need to put the helmets on and buckle the chinstraps. It’s gonna be a long game.” O’Brien, who was elected general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for a five year term in 2022, is running for reelection along with Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. The incumbents face a challenge from Philadelphia-based head of Teamsters local 623 Richard Hooker Jr., and his “Fearless 2026” slate. Candidates need at least 5% of delegates at a Teamsters convention in June to advance to the November election. O’Brien held his kick-off rally at the Knights of Columbus in Charlestown at noon Sunday, cheered on by a hometown crowd. The president highlighted his accomplishments over his five years in office, including organizing over 90,000 new members — noting he hopes to hit 100,000 by the end of 2026 — securing financial stability for members on strike, making sure no contract can be implemented that members vote down and ensuring rank and file members a seat at bargaining tables. “There is no union that is doing what we’re doing,” O’Brien said. “We negotiated the largest settlement and the largest collective bargaining agreement in the entire country. When people didn’t think we could do it, we got a $30 million deal. We negotiated the strongest contracts in the food service, in the rubbish, in the airline, in every single every single division we represent.” O’Brien also came at Hooker directly, saying “if you listen to him, you think he’s running against Donald Trump, not Sean O’Brien.” Hooker has been a vocal critic of the relationship between Trump and O’Brien, who met privately with the president and spoke at the Republican national convention ahead of his election. “He has not discussed one platform of what he’s going to do to improve this union,” O’Brien said, accusing the challenger of only organizing two contracts. In response to the rally, the Hooker campaign contended the candidate has negotiated five contracts, with two being first time contracts, since being elected in 2020. “Our campaign has explicitly talked about member power and how plan on giving it to them,” the Hooker campaign said. … “One of the campaign platforms is to lower the per capita revenue the international union receives so local unions can survive. With so many layoffs and building closures happening in our ranks, local union will lose resources to fight against employers. Without the resources, local unions will have a difficult time to organize new workers.” O’Brien noted the goal is to make sure the opposition does not even advance to the November ballot. “Of course, why wouldn’t you want to run when the pensions are fixed, when the strike benefit at its highest, when membership continues to grow,” said O’Brien. “F—, that’s pretty easy, isn’t it, to walk in, but we’re not going to look back. We’re going to look forward.” The president spoke to continued “trials and tribulations” ahead of the union, calling Amazon the “largest white collar crime syndicate in the world.” “They’re represented in every single division we represent,” said O’Brien. “They’re our biggest threat. And by us getting the strongest contracts in each in all divisions, we are empowering the non-union to look at what we’re achieving.” The crowd was enthusiastically supportive of O’Brien and Zuckerman Sunday, packing into the event space and cheering loudly. O’Brien called the rally the largest attended union meeting in five years. “We’re going to keep going to every state, every city,” said O’Brien. “Make sure that we’re getting our message out there, make sure we’re talking to members, make sure they’re included and make sure we’re transparent about what our agenda is moving forward for the next five years, and just execute it.”

Title: Fortune 100 companies are back in the office — but 'work from home dark matter' is thriving under the radar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows. Think of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies. As of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL. However, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work. Bloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as "work-from-home dark matter" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar. "We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data," he said. For companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize. Have a story to share about hiring, layoffs, or work life in Big Tech, Corporate America, or on Wall Street? Fill out this form or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Bloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up. Bloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers. Additionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are "off the record" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval. Bloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility. "Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs," he said, adding, "Managers ultimately care about their team performance." One of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an "off-the-record" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Not every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey. Loewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported. Bloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital. The survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility. A report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Leslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," said Snipes, who's in her 30s. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." In addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices. Some employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to "coffee badging," the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements. If a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility. Amid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work. "Work from home is here to stay," he said. "But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record." Juliana Kaplan contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: I had 90 days to find a job after getting laid off while on a work visa. A $50 book helped me land my dream role.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US. During my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer. This time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles. Despite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job. After learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review. With my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas. I came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for. The job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one. My referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role. I could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself. Fortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews. Business Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Landing an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on "Decode and Conquer," a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin. By emailing the author with my receipt as proof of purchase, I gained access to a Slack community with more than 20,000 members, including aspiring product managers, current PMs, and professionals between jobs like myself. What I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable. One of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously. Doing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays. Some interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response. The community also proved valuable for networking. Over about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process. I received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work. One of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer. Jump to

Title: The first year of Trump 2.0

Time Published: 2026-01-17T16:12:49Z
Full Content:
-324.17 -108.85 -58.00 + 2,516.00 + 15,238.00 -324.17 -108.85 -108.85 -58.00 -58.00 + 2,516.00 As the world has its fingers crossed waiting for the verdict on tariffs from the US Supreme Court, the US President Donald Trump would complete his first year in office on Tuesday. It was an eventful year to put it mildly — the kind that puts twist-laden thrillers to shame. The Oval Office kept buzzing with one executive order after another — on tariffs, immigration, DOGE, oil drilling, brokering peace and big-bang investments in AI — that kept the entire world on edge. At this juncture, we take stock of how the US economy and markets performed in the first year of Trump 2.0 and look at how US equities are placed for the rest of his tenure. GDP Under Trump, the US economy got off to a rocky start with real GDP contracting by 0.6 per cent in Q1-2025. This is the first time the economy had contracted since declining 1 per cent in Q1-2022. However, in Q2 and Q3, the economy grew 3.8 per cent and 4.3 per cent. These figures are quarter on quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised growth rates. In the US, personal consumption expenditure or PCE accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the GDP. Though PCE pulled its weight in Q2 and Q3, the real kicker came from a sharp decline in imports and good growth in exports, particularly services. Readers can recall that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kicked in from April 2025. Trade balance While discussing tariffs, let us also address balance of payments (difference between exports and imports). Data is available for 2025 up to October. Trade deficit (goods and services) between January and October widened by $56 billion year on year or about 8 per cent. In the same period in 2024, trade deficit grew about 13 per cent. This is probably because the US didn’t import as much after reciprocal tariffs came into effect, while exports continued to grow (6.3 per cent). Focusing just on goods, between January and October, imports grew 6.7 per cent year on year and trade balance widened 8 per cent. As can be seen from the chart, imports were front-loaded during January-March and barely grew/ declined in the months after. Based on 2024 data, the European Union (19 per cent), Mexico (16 per cent), China (13 per cent) and Canada (13 per cent) made up 61 per cent of total import of goods and are the top exporters to the US. Imports from China were hit the most with a 26 per cent decline. Imports from the EU and Mexico grew 7 per cent and 6 per cent, while those from Canada declined 5 per cent. PMI Domestic manufacturing wasn’t robust either, going by the ISM PMI (Institute of Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index). Barring January and February, the index never crossed the 50-mark (see chart). A reading of over 50 indicates an expansion and vice-versa. This is a hit rate of 17 per cent (two out of 12 months) versus 86 per cent in Trump 1.0 (2020 has been excluded due to Covid). Inflation Now, onto whether tariffed imports caused higher inflation. Here, we are going with the PCE index, which the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets to keep under 2 per cent. Prices had risen 2.7 per cent in December 2024. Since then, the index marked a low of 2.3 per cent in April 2025. In the months that followed, the index has been steadily up, marking a rise of 2.8 per cent in September. This is the latest reading on the index. However, going with CPI, that index, too, marked a low of 2.3 per cent (in recent times) in April. Prices steadily rose in the months after, to 3 per cent in September, but have since cooled to 2.7 per cent in November and December. These could probably be the months when the Americans consumed imported goods that were tariffed at negotiated lower rates, considering shipping time. It doesn’t appear that tariffs have caused prices to shoot up dramatically. It remains to be seen whether the PCE index, too, will replicate this trajectory and sustain below 2 per cent. Jobs The year 2025 has been a tough one for job-seeking Americans, with ‘Big Tech’ and other corporate layoffs. Unemployment rate, at 4.1 per cent in December 2024, crept upward to 4.5 per cent in November 2025 – such a rate was last recorded only in October 2021. It improved marginally in December to 4.4 per cent. Going with non-farm payroll additions, 49,000 jobs per month, on an average, were added in 2025, compared with a mean of 141,000 in the eight years between 2017 and 2024 (Trump 1.0 + Joe Biden’s term). This period is considered as it nullifies the job losses during the pandemic and the hiring spree that followed. June, August, October even saw a month-on-month decline in payroll. This is a phenomenon last observed only in December 2020. Macros in short: Consumption has done okay, although it needs to be noted that this is driven by a K-shaped economy. Imports have declined, jobs are in poor state and prices are uncertain to decline sustainably. S&P 500 in the first year of Presidents Before we move on to markets, here’s a fun stat. We compared how S&P 500 performed in the first year of Presidents — over 50 years, in the last 14 terms, starting from when Gerald Ford took over after Richard Nixon resigned (see Table 1). Trump 2.0 (2025) falls in the bottom half at the eighth position, with 2017 under Trump 1.0 the third best. With the mean of the sample at 11 per cent, 2025 is still above average. How asset classes fared US equities have given good returns. S&P 500, Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite have delivered 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 20 per cent, since January 20, 2025 (inauguration day) till date. While S&P 500 returned 16 per cent, its EPS grew just 12.5 per cent. Sector-wise performance of S&P 500 constituents has been given in Table 3. All sectors posted earnings growth, except for energy, while heavy-weight IT’s profit grew 26 per cent. The market cap of the Mag7 stocks expanded 20 per cent in aggregate, with their earnings growing 26 per cent (comparing 2024 earnings with estimated earnings for 2025, which is the sum of actual earnings up to Q3 2025 and consensus estimates for Q4 2025). Stocks excluding the Mag7 (S&P 493) have delivered 14 per cent returns for a 11 per cent rise in earnings. Within the Mag7, except Alphabet and Nvidia, the rest delivered modest returns between 1 per cent and 9 per cent. Alphabet and Nvidia returned 65 per cent and 34 per cent. Globally, equity indices have fared better than their US counterparts. Korean KOSPI and the Japanese Nikkei 225 indices stand out with returns of 92 per cent and 40 per cent, while Hong Kong-based Hang Seng rose 37 per cent. Indices in Europe — DAX, FTSE 100 and Euro Stoxx 50 delivered between 17 per cent and 20 per cent. This trend can also be observed in how currencies have moved in the comparable period. The dollar index (DXY) recorded one of its worst years in history (9th worst), falling 9.3 per cent. The Euro, GBP and Yuan gained 13 per cent, 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, while DXY fell 9 per cent. Tariffs-caused volatility, a falling dollar against the backdrop of a 20+ per cent correction in crude prices partly meant indices in Europe and China fared better. The falling dollar is also one reason why gold and silver gave stellar returns ($ terms) of 70 per cent and 197 per cent. On to the debt market now. Debt ETFs gave good returns. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs are presented in the table as representatives. Trump came to power when bond yields had spiked from the lows of September 2024, after the Fed started cutting rates, on fears that the rate cuts were premature. Through 2025, although yields have cooled, they have remained high and stubbornly above 4 per cent. What is noteworthy is that yields at the longer end of the curve have held up more (see chart). This could well be because of the lack of clarity as to whether inflation can be tamed and sustained under the Fed’s target range. If anyone was as excited about striking ‘deals’ after Trump, it should be the ‘tech bros’ of Silicon Valley, with their big-bang AI deals, often among themselves. The $500-billion Stargate project where OpenAI and Oracle are parties, Nvidia’s planned $100-billion investment in Open AI and the US government’s purchase of a 10-per cent stake in Intel for over $10 billion come to mind. The year also saw AI start-ups such as Anthropic, Perplexity and OpenAI raise millions of dollars at exorbitant valuations. With the economic use-cases for AI still only evolving, it appears as if the line between optimism and delusion have blurred on Wall Street. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and Meta are estimated to invest about $1.1 trillion in capex over 2025 and 2026. Applying a fixed asset turnover ratio of 2x implies an expected incremental revenue of $2.2 trillion which is 1.3x the current revenue of these five giants ($1.6 trillion) - such a revenue growth is highly unlikely To be fair, market did get jittery about AI stocks late in the year. However, even after steep corrections, stocks such as Oracle have still given good returns over the year and are yet valued at a premium to their five-year mean earnings multiples (see Table 4). For some, current valuations are baking in very high earnings growth expectations, anywhere between 50-130 per cent, over the next 12 months. For Mag7 stocks such as Alphabet and Meta, the cash cow of ad revenue has to fire to support capital investments in AI – and such revenue is tied to sustainability of strong consumption, especially on a high base. The combined market cap of top AI stocks is now over 42 per cent of S&P 500’s full market cap, and the combined earnings are over 30 per cent of the combined earnings of all S&P 500 stocks. Clearly, a lot is riding on the AI wave. In 2026, either AI clicks or the stocks fold. The past year has been a strange one where all asset classes performed well — equities, real assets and debt. Such scenarios don’t last long, and the near future could prove investors in one or more asset classes wrong. For now, that asset class could be US equities. The S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 28x, building in an estimated earnings growth of 16 per cent over the next 12 months. As can be seen from the chart, the index is now trading at valuations above sub-prime peak levels and at similar multiples as the dotcom bubble. While robust AI-led earnings growth is not a given at this stage, rerating in equities can be even challenging – with yields at the longer end not giving in. While the bullish views on the AI trade and consequently the US markets is now well known, it would be worth taking note of an interesting point brought out by long-term fund manager Dr John Hussman. He was prescient in his bearish calls, just ahead of the peak of the dotcom bubble and the 2007 housing bubble. While his bearish views over the last few years have not played out, he makes an interesting point for investors to ponder. He points out that corporate profits (surplus) have reached record levels and this has been made possible by the deficit/ debt of the other two sectors – namely, households and government. While household and government debt has grown to exorbitant levels, equities’ valuations are still factoring in record surpluses of corporates to sustain, ignoring events such as credit defaults. If such events unfold, equity bulls could be caught napping. Recent tremors in the US private credit market must not be ignored. In other words, sustained good returns in US equities would require continued increase in government deficit. His view: Even taking the sectoral deficit/surplus structure as durable, I expect we’ll see market losses, both in the S&P 500 and in the technology sector, on the order of -50 per cent to -70 per cent over the completion of this cycle. While Trump takes pride in record stock market levels, the real test will be in 2026, as brewing affordability crisis undermines macro-economic numbers, cracks emerge on the AI trade, tariff impacts deepen, showdown with the Fed heats up and geopolitics is at its toughest in decades. All this must be offset by an AI miracle to justify the current S&P 500 valuation. Published on January 17, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: ‘They’ve pickled each others’ brains’

Longtime entrepreneur and critic Anil Dash on where the tech industry has been and where it may be going 2:00 PM PST on January 14, 2026 Tech entrepreneur and writer Anil Dash. Photo: Anil Dash Advertisement opens in a new tab. These are tough times for tech workers. Half-a-million tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as their companies continued to invest, insatiably, in AI and deploy products that have caused psychosis in their own investors, seamlessly produced and proliferated child sex abuse material, and encouraged teenagers to kill themselves. So-called “hard tech” is in: Jobs in defense and surveillance are the hottest roles on the market. Working 9-9-6 (that’s 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) is the new answer to work-life balance. And for anyone still holding onto the progressive, pro-immigrant, “democratizing” dreams of the tech industry of the 2010s, Big Tech leaders (and some of their partners, including a distracting Lauren Sánchez) made their new political alignment clear as day just under a year ago, when they joined Donald Trump at his second inauguration. Anil Dash is not surprised by the dark turn the industry has taken. As a seasoned entrepreneur, prolific early blogger, and proponent for civil liberties in the digital world (he sits on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), Dash has kept a close eye on tech leaders and chronicled the impacts on the workforce in his blog, including a recent post with the howling headline How the hell are you supposed to have a career in tech in 2026?. To usher our tech-minded (and anti-tech-minded) readers into 2026, Gazetteer SF got Dash on the phone for a chat about AI, labor, why the MAGA ethos has taken hold of the industry, and a grand VC conspiracy. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. You said this moment in tech is “grim” and “about as bad as you’ve seen.” What are the forces that have brought us to this moment? A great one, that is going somewhat underreported, is just the numbers. ChatGPT came out in late 2022, a little over three years ago, and since then there have been over half-a-million layoffs across the tech sector. Just that one signal — put all the other things aside — that’s decimation. That’s twice as much as the DOGE guys cut in the federal government. This would be devastating if it was the auto industry. It’s ten times as many people as work in the entirety of coal mining. It’s shocking to think about that many jobs gone. This industry’s been gutted. In any normal time, people would say, “Oh, this is a recession.” But because those same companies [who are doing layoffs] are doing this financial sleight-of-hand where they’re doing deals with each other — like, “We’ll buy machines from you and you buy AI from us,” — they make it look like the share prices are going up, so it doesn’t look like a recession. That’s part one. Part two is what we’re seeing at the top, which trickles down to tech workers and creates this really grim outlook. What I mean is we’re seeing this new technique of the leaders of these companies — the investors, owners, CEOs — are now able to make money even if the companies never make money. That’s new. It started a little over ten years ago, and I’ll give you Uber as an example. Before they went public, Uber had only ever lost money. Billions and billions of dollars. And yet, their investors were still able to make billions of billions of dollars in profit by making this thing public and recouping that money on IPO day. That is different than everything else in the prior history of the industry. What they figured out was if you tell a great story, and, importantly, if you get a legal monopoly, which Uber and Lyft basically did, you can print money kind of without regard to whether it ever makes sense as a business or not. So that’s been a pattern with everything that’s followed, whether it’s crypto or AI. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that's not venture capital. This isn’t even venture capital anymore. Venture capital means you take a risk. High risk, high reward. If there’s no risk, that’s not venture capital. If you wouldn’t call this venture capitalism, what would you call it? It’s pure crony capitalism. Corruption capitalism. These days, when you go to raise, the VCs are explicit about how they’re all talking to each other about what your business is, what your economics are, what they think of your company, what they each think they might offer you. That is collusion. They’re not competitors. It is essentially one company with different divisions, openly sharing information against entrepreneurs. If you get to even a Series B, you will have to take money from either Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund or Ron Conway, and it’s straight-up Godfather shit. They’ll say, “You’re gonna need help some day, and we can help you. We know PR. If you get stuck, we know someone in the White House.” Let’s talk about the tech and White House. When we think of the tech industry of the 2010s, we think of progressive, optimistic ideals. Now, we’re seeing the hard tech era and tech leaders cutting DEI and supporting Trump. For those of us who weren’t there, was the tech industry of the 2010s just marketed differently, or did it really operate differently? For workers, it was genuinely really different. It was peak Obama optimism era, and it was 100 percent sincere. The creature comforts were really good, the benefits were great, the holiday parties were huge. And structurally, tech companies were genuinely providing upward mobility for people. They were genuine advocates for H-1B visas. People now are at this point where they're so beaten down they're kind of like, “Was it all a lie?” But I had enough visibility and access, like I’ve had dinner with Jeff Bezos, I’ve been in the room, and I can say they were different. They have changed, and been changed by intentional political actors like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. And now they’ve pickled each others’ brains. Do you think today’s founders have to move in this more libertarian direction to survive in this industry? They don’t even have to move. I talk to young founders these days and for them, there’s no other world than the Trump world. I ask them what inspired them to go into tech and they say they read Marc Andreessen’s manifesto, they read Peter Thiel’s books, and I think, “Oh, your brain’s cooked.” They come in pre-pickled. But everyone else who could have told an alternate narrative has been hounded out of the industry. In terms of the libertarian bent, those intentional political actors like Peter Thiel were very intentional about it. They created their own media ecosystem. They created Substack — they, meaning Andreessen Horowitz is a big investor — and paid to have content on there that would drive users to their own media. They took over culture. On the topic of VC media ecosystems, I saw the Thread you posted a few days ago about common things VCs believe. One was “Platforms need Nazis on them.” What do you mean by that? Well, it’s inciting. These guys like Thiel and [White House AI czar David] Sacks have been fixated for 30 years on trying to normalize and re-assert the public use of slurs. One of the examples they use [in their 1998 polemic The Diversity Myth] is the r-slur, which had just fallen out of favor in the early ‘90s. And they were explicitly saying not being able to use these slurs reflects growing political power from these groups, and that's why we need to bring them back. I have these notes that I’ve written, and I need to wait until I can like spend my entire waking hours defending the onslaught of shit I’ll get for writing it, but I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. I really think the thing that they’ve been working towards for 10 years is to get Trump to be able to use the n-word in public. And I think we are less than a year away. That is dark. I can’t even contain my reaction to that. That is scary. I want to be wrong. But, yeah, they want to make sure [marginalized groups] don’t have power, and that’s signified by having Nazis on a platform. On that note of power, with all the layoffs and the bleakness among the workforce, do you think we’re going to see any sort of labor power movement in the tech industry? I’m hopeful. There was a moment in 2018, 2019, 2020, early COVID, when I thought there was going to be a moment. That’s when you had Amazon workers unionize in Staten Island [in 2022] and the first Google union [in 2021]. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the next 18 months after that they put $10 billion into teaching tools how to code. Like, ChatGPT comes at the end of 2022, right? It’s not entirely because of that, but it’s not not because of that. Also, like I said, [tech workers’] brains are pre-pickled. They don’t know the first thing about labor, and they’re trepidatious about learning because it’s coded “other.” Like, solidarity with the people serving meals in their workplaces is terrifying, because those people are completely disposable. None of those people have equity, none of those people have any job security. To somebody graduating college in 2026, would you recommend a career in tech? I think it’s hard. But compared to what? Compared to being a prison guard? Yes. But I do think tech is going to be the industry that is most changed by AI. Right now, ChatGPT can write a memo for you, write code for you. But the tools they’re building now, it’ll be more like one tool will replace an entire team of software engineers. For someone entering college in 2026, would you recommend studying computer science? It puts a pit in my stomach to say it, but no. I think [coding] should be part of people’s lives, for sure. But should you go into it as a career? I feel the same way about it when somebody says to me, “I’m going to learn an instrument for a living.” I’m like, “Well, hold on.” If you’re going to be the best in the world at that instrument, okay, go ahead. But if you’re not going to be the best in the world, it’s going to be a hard road for you. Last year, we heard so much about the AI bubble. Do you think we’ll see a crash in 2026? They’ve sort of economically engineered themselves out of crashing, and this is sort of similar to the de-risking of venture capital. When there's no risk, you don’t have crashes and you don’t have bailouts. And this is sort of, again, a feature of fascism versus capitalism. It was trendy in the last couple of years to call where we’re at “late-stage capitalism.” Would you call this fascism? Yeah, we’re there. Okay, the million dollar question: Do you still feel optimistic about the tech industry? Well, I have to believe. Part of the reason why is that I’ve seen it change people’s lives for the better. I think you can still build a thing that does connect the world and enables people to be part of the lives of people they love using technology. People can do it again. I think people are starting to understand the stakes. People understand that Elon Musk made a machine that makes child abuse material. I think it has to get pretty dire before people will make a change. But I think it can happen again. Do you see anybody leading that charge? There are some small projects, but I don’t want to blow anybody up yet. They’re fragile. Advertisement opens in a new tab.

Title: Ubisoft Cuts 55 more jobs in Sweden after Halifax studio closure and unionization vote

Toward the beginning of the new year, Ubisoft announced its second round of terminations amid an organizational restructuring that could affect an estimated 55 positions across its Swedish studios, including Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment. This follows a call for a voluntary leave program in the fall of 2025. Ubisoft informed its employees about these changes on January 13 and explained that they came after the completion of the voluntary program, concluding a long-term roadmap and evaluating the structure required to operate effectively. In a statement to IGN, Ubisoft said, “Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructuring that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm.” The company further explained: This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clear visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainability over time. Ubisoft stressed that these layoffs were not tied to individual employee performance or recent game releases, but to structural requirements. One of the affected studios, Massive Entertainment, has been known for its work on The Division series, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It has been one of Ubisoft’s key contributors since the studio’s acquisition in 2008. Ubisoft Stockholm, on the other hand, had opened recently, collaborated on the Avatar project, and was reported to be working on an unannounced project. Ubisoft reassured the studios that these restructuring shifts would not affect their long-term roadmaps and that projects currently in development, such as The Division 3, would not be affected. To put things in perspective, this is the second wave of job cuts under Ubisoft's helm in 2026. Earlier, on January 6, Ubisoft announced the shuttering of its Halifax studio, resulting in the termination of 71 employees. Strangely, this shutdown happened right after the studio voted in favor of unionization. However, Ubisoft insists that this decision was made in tandem with the company’s efforts to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and cut costs. The Halifax team has worked on mobile titles like Assassin’s Creed Rebellion. Buy Assassin's Creed Shadows on Amazon here IGN
