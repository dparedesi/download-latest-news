By Tyler O'Neil, The Daily Signal October 3, 2025 FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added.

The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combatting real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

Title: Federal workers share shutdown anxieties and young Trump supporters express frustration: Morning Rundown

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Furloughed federal workers were already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, then came the government shutdown. Frustrated young Trump supporters express what they want to see out of the president. And, Taylor Swift album drops have always been an event; her 12th one was no different. Here's what to know today. Furloughed federal employees won't be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government. And with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown enters its third day, some federal employees say they are "sad," "scared" and "afraid." While most of the furloughed employees won't be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential — such as members of the military and airport security screeners — will continue working without pay. Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In addition to the uncertainty around paychecks, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings. That's left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her mortgage. Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda. "I was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid," an Arizona TSA worker said, explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her. She will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown. Read the full story. President Donald Trump's victory last year was fueled in part by young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed his campaign are beginning to sour on his administration's approach to immigration and the economy. Fourteen swing-state Trump voters under age 30 participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 "Deciders" series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. Nine said they disapproved of Trump's overall job performance so far, while five approved. The group included eight self-identified independents and six Republicans. And while some of the voters in the focus groups detailed concerns about Trump, that didn’t necessarily mean they're inclined to support Democrats. Many of them described the Democratic Party as weak and out of touch. Read the full story. Sean "Diddy" Combs apologized and expressed how "sorry" he was "for all of the hurt and pain" he caused in a letter to the judge set to sentence him on two prostitution-related convictions today. Combs, who faces up to 20 years in prison, also asked for mercy, writing he has "been humbled and broken to my core." The letter marks the first time that Combs has addressed U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian in any meaningful way. During the eight-week federal trial, Combs did not testify and gave brief answers to questions from the judge. Read the full story. Taylor Swift has already broken records with her latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," being the most pre-saved album ever on Spotify, making her the first female artist to exceed 100 million album sales. The album features a dozen tracks and reunited her with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who produced her most recent albums. Fans are also expected to flock to movie theaters this weekend to catch "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which the singer described as a "dazzling soirée." The theatrical event will include the premiere of the music video for "The Fate of Ophelia." Read the latest updates on "The Life of a Showgirl" in our liveblog. Perhaps, nobody knows more about how to sound like Trump than Ryan Chen, a social media star from "CHI-na." Though Chen has never set foot in the U.S., he sounds as American as the president himself, nailing Trump's tone, rambling cadence, and the signature hand gestures. In his first U.S. media interview, Chen told NBC News that he posted his first Trump impression video last fall just as a dare. But the clip went viral. So, he just kept going. Chen's popularity continues to grow at home and abroad even amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, Chen said his videos aren't about politics, and he just wants to make people laugh by introducing Chinese food and culture to foreigners in Trump's accent. – Peter Guo, associate producer Still unsure what's actually worth buying during Prime Big Deal Days?

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. It is pertinent to mention that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been vocal critics of the H-1B visa programme and have consistently contended that these visas are being abused by many to replace US workers with cheaper labour from overseas. In fact, just a few days after their missive to the ten companies, the senators said they are reintroducing bipartisan legislation to "reform and close loopholes" in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act targets fraud and abuse in US immigration system, provides protection for American workers and visa holders and enhances transparency in the foreign worker recruitment process, the two argued. "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the US on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions." On TCS, the statement noted that the company recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. "In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favour of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders," it said. It further said Cognizant Technology Solutions laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the US. "In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favoured South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages," it added. E-mails sent to TCS and Cognizant for comments by PTI did not elicit a response. The statement by Grassley and Durbin noted that Amazon laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Google, it said, laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 per cent of its small team managers "despite enjoying records profits". In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees, the statement observed. According to it, Meta laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labelled it a "year of efficiency". "In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five per cent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees," it said. Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees in fiscal year 2025, as per the statement. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits, it said adding amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterised its actions as an "enigma of success".

Title: How posting on TikTok helped this 22-year-old land a software engineering role at Amazon after a yearlong job hunt

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, Andrew Chen couldn't stop thinking about the ticking clock. He was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. Then a glimmer of hope landed in his inbox: an email from Amazon inviting him to interview for a software engineering role in 10 days. He knew he couldn't waste the opportunity, so he made a plan: hole up in his room to study — and document his preparation for the big day on TikTok to hold himself accountable. "I canceled all my social obligations, locked myself in my room, and basically only left the house to have lunch," said the 22-year-old. "I was thinking, if I don't get this job, this is all for nothing." Chen is among the many recent college graduates who have struggled to find work. As of June, the most recent data available, 4.8% of Americans ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree were unemployed — higher than the 4.0% jobless rate among the broader working-age population, a reversal from the typical trend in recent decades. These challenges reflect a broader hiring slowdown that's hit entry-level job seekers especially hard. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are hiring at one of the slowest paces since 2014. Tech professionals, including computer science graduates like Chen, have been particularly affected, with layoffs at firms including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. On Indeed, US software development job postings have declined by over 70% from their peak in 2022. While some new graduates are still searching, others, like Chen, have used creative job-search and interview preparation strategies to secure offers.

You can also find more of our job market coverage below: Chen began looking for a full-time job in the summer of 2024. As a computer science major, he'd always envisioned starting his career in software engineering. But after applying to more than 400 jobs and struggling to gain traction, he expanded his search to include product management and design roles. But he didn't give up on software engineering. Between September 2024 and early February 2025, Chen applied to several software engineering roles at Amazon. In mid-February, he was asked to complete an online assessment for one of the roles he had applied to — he's still unsure exactly which one — that included a coding test and behavioral questions. He thought he had done well — news he excitedly shared with his parents — but as the months passed, he never received an update about his application status. "My parents would keep asking for updates on Amazon because it's a name brand," he said. "And I eventually told them I got rejected — I thought if I hadn't heard from them after months, it's probably not going to happen." By the time Amazon reached out in May, Chen said he was deep in interviews for product management and design roles — and had nearly given up on software engineering entirely. The unexpected opportunity to return to his preferred field was welcome, but its timing posed a challenge. After focusing on other types of roles, he'd largely stopped practicing his coding skills and would need to quickly brush up before the interview. Chen had just 10 days to prepare — and still had to carve out time for interviews with other companies, in addition to school exams and final projects. So he developed a plan of attack, dividing his days into blocks for coding practice on LeetCode, behavioral prep, and studying for other interviews. He set out to read everything he could on platforms like Reddit and Blind about Amazon's interview process and past candidates' experiences, practice common technical questions, study the company's leadership principles, and memorize STAR-format personal stories that illustrated how he embodied those values. "This was the first big company that had given me a chance in a while," he said, "so I really wanted to get this one." But pulling this all off seemed daunting, and Chen felt he needed something to help him stay motivated. Then he had an idea. He'd been interested in creating social media content for a while but had only posted a handful of TikToks. What if he started documenting his preparation for the Amazon interview? Sharing updates publicly on TikTok, he figured, would add the kind of pressure he needed to stay locked in — and maybe even attract advice from others who'd been through the process. On May 19, Chen posted a TikTok with the caption "10 days until FAANG final interview," sharing how much prep he'd done, how many classes he'd skipped, how much caffeine he'd consumed, and how many showers he'd taken. He followed it with similar updates in the days that followed. Chen said his videos — which received as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions, including skepticism that he could land the role given his limited preparation time. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," he said. When interview day arrived in late May, Chen was anxious and sleep-deprived. He said his Amazon "loop" interview process consisted of three back-to-back virtual interviews with short breaks in between. The first round focused on technical questions, the second on behavioral scenarios tied to Amazon's leadership principles, and the third included a mix of both. "I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed," he said. Chen gradually settled in as the day went on and left the interviews feeling like he'd done his best. On June 3, shortly after finishing his third interview of the day for non-Amazon roles, he saw an email notification on his phone. He'd received an offer from Amazon with a six-figure salary. On June 5, Chen posted a TikTok with the news that received over 941,000 views. He graduated in mid-June and, after moving to New York City, started working full-time in July. Chen said his biggest takeaway from the Amazon interviews was the company's emphasis on behavioral questions tied to its leadership principles — something he felt played to his strengths. "They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise," he said. "I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that." One of his top pieces of advice for job seekers: while application quality matters, volume is essential in a tough market. "Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game," he said. "You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for." Jump to

Title: Meta gives advertisers new AI personalization tools - while using your chats to target content

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Meta is continuing to build AI for advertisers. Its latest AI agent and several new tools are designed to serve as an automated online sales assistant and personalization feature for small- to medium-sized businesses, even outside of Facebook and other Meta platforms. Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude At the same time, the company will start using your chats with Meta AI to personalize the ads you see on Meta platforms. The company's new Business AI agent can provide online shoppers with basic customer support and product recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The goal is to quicken the process between customers discovering a new product and completing a purchase, while simultaneously freeing businesses up to focus their attention on more pressing tasks. Leading tech companies have been investing heavily in business-facing AI agents, promoting them as a simple and effective way to automate busywork. Like many other agents, Business AI specializes in analyzing and integrating with the context of the business deploying it; the system automatically assesses a brand's preexisting online presence to modify its outputs. Also: How autonomous businesses succeed by engaging with the world Eligible businesses can now access Meta's new agent for free via Meta Ads. It's also available "at a fraction of the cost of other solutions," Meta wrote in a company blog post, for businesses based in the US that want to add it to their website, or to their WhatsApp and Messenger accounts, with availability in more countries expected soon. (A company spokesperson declined to provide additional details around the agent's pricing structure.) Alongside this product release, Meta had some news about its user experience and personalization policy. Starting Dec. 16, the company will begin using individual users' interactions with its Meta AI chatbot to customize the ads and content recommendations they see on Facebook and Instagram, the company announced Wednesday. Someone asking one of Meta's chatbots about local dining options, for example, might start seeing ads for nearby restaurants on Meta platforms. There's no opt-out option for the new personalization changes, Meta said in its announcement. You always have the option of not interacting with the company's chatbots while using its apps, of course, but the company is also reportedly working on chatbots that proactively strike up a conversation with users. Also: My new favorite Photoshop AI tool lets me combine images in one click - and I can't stop Some conversation topics won't be included as training data, including anything that covers sexual orientation, health, race, religion, or political views. Chats that take place before Dec. 16 also won't be used, and the personalization changes will not initially apply to users in the UK, South Korea, or the European Union, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to ZDNET. While Meta said it won't start using chat data for targeting ads until Dec. 16, it's hard not to see a relationship between the company's increased in-house personalization via AI and the launch of external AI personalization tools for businesses. It's unclear what the relationship will be between user chat data and the models powering external tools for advertisers. Meta also announced Thursday that it was launching more AI tools to help businesses create ads on Advantage+, its AI-powered social media ad campaign management platform. There's a new AI-generated music feature, for example, which, according to Meta, "understands the content of an ad and produces unique, custom music that reflects the product, style, and sentiment -- helping brands better engage their audiences and connect in new ways." Also: Meta wants AI to automate every step of the ad production process - report The company also introduced AI dubbing for quick translation to reach international audiences, a tool for generating higher-quality AI-generated videos in ads, and another that generates a set of images curated to different audience demographics. The new features build on a broader offering of generative AI tools for advertisers, which Meta first began rolling out in October 2023, during the company's so-called "Year of Efficiency," which centered on -- among other initiatives -- internal layoffs and a shift in focus toward AI. While Meta pushes new AI tools to businesses to help them sell products, the company is also working towards automating the entirety of the advertising production process, from ideation to campaign launch -- although it isn't totally clear at this point what such comprehensive automation might look like in practice. Also: The work AI should really be doing, according to these pros Similarly, Amazon unveiled an agent last month that can assist with every step of creating a short video ad, including the generation of custom voiceovers.

It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2014. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,” Souls archeologist Lance McDonald wrote in a thread that’s been circulating again recently. 6 years ago @ShawnLayden delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing.

Starbreeze announced the project has been canceledÂ as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise. âThis was a difficult but necessary decision,âÂ CEO Adolf Kristjansson said in a statement. âOur strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreezeâs position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.â The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, GamesIndustry.bizÂ reports. The change comes after the cancellation of a Disco Elysium sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads. “It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told GamesIndustry.biz. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio.

That was after several viral posts dunking on the latest Xbox move. Kotaku reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last.

Dune: Awakening debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since. “The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios.

Title: Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios announces Liverpool shutdown and workforce cuts in Sweden

The Swedish developer behind the Just Cause and Mad Max series, Avalanche Studios, has announced the shutdown of its Liverpool studio, alongside a reduction of workforce at its core Malmo and Stockholm locations. The studio broke the news in a statement published on the company’s website on September 30, 2025, amid ongoing hurdles in the gaming industry. The Liverpool studio, established in 2020 as part of its global expansion, has now ceased operation entirely. Previously, the Liverpool location focused on support roles and had not released any standalone titles. Avalanche stated: In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success best. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio and to initiate a collective consultation process as required by UK law. This will impact all “Avalanchers” in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmo and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs. The company also mentioned that it is focusing on offering full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time and that, despite the structural changes, the studio will remain fully committed to delivering amazing games to its passionate players. Currently, the number of affected employees remains under wraps. Avalanche Studios Group employs more than 600 people worldwide. This move marks the third such action by the company in just over a year, following the shutdown of its New York and Montreal offices in June 2024, which resulted in 50 layoffs. This announcement comes just one month after Microsoft canceled the co-op heist game, Contraband, which was being developed by Avalanche’s Liverpool team, which was first revealed four years ago in 2021. In August 2025, Microsoft paused development on the title amid its sweeping layoffs, and Avalanche announced that “active development has now stopped.” Considering the given circumstances, it seems unlikely that Contraband will be released anytime soon.

The Estée Lauder Cos.-owned brand has removed e-commerce capabilities and content from its website. Instead, a text-based page now informs shoppers that while it’s unable to accept new orders, it’s still here “to help with any existing orders or refunds.” Shoppers are advised that they can still buy Glamglow products on Amazon.

Title: Aware Super, Goodman Group Launch $1.3B U.S. Logistics Platform

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Two Australian titans have joined forces on a $1.3 billion logistics real estate platform that is leased to heavyweight tenants like Amazon. Aware Super, one of Australia’s largest pension fund managers, bought a 49 percent stake in the venture with Goodman Group, a global industrial and infrastructure developer. The firms will target “undersupplied” infill industrial markets within the U.S. The exact financial contribution of each firm was not disclosed. Three assets currently comprise the $1.3 billion platform, all in Southern California totaling nearly 2.8 million square feet. They include Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach, at 2401 East Wardlow Road, Goodman Commerce Center Los Angeles, at 4841 West San Fernando, and Goodman Gateway Santa Fe Springs, which makes up two contiguous properties at 12801 Excelsior Drive and 14420 Bloomfield Avenue. The properties are currently leased by the likes of Amazon, Maersk and Relativity Space. Relativity Space in 2021, for example, inked a roughly 1 million-square-foot lease at Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach. “Our U.S. business represents over 37 percent of Goodman Group’s offshore earnings and is an increasingly important part of our global investment strategy,” Gregory Goodman, Goodman Group’s CEO, said in a statement. “Alongside our long-standing investment partner, Aware Super, we see significant growth opportunities in our key U.S. infill markets to support the development of essential infrastructure in a rapidly transforming digital economy.” Goodman controls several industrial platforms and portfolios across the U.S., including one it splits with Norges Bank Investment Management. The investment arm of the Norwegian bank in early 2025 paid $1.07 billion for a 45 percent stake in a 48-building logistics stable, most of which is in Southern California. Aware Super has a more diverse U.S. investment strategy. Last summer, the pension manager, along with development partner Lendlease, secured a $316 million construction loan forHabitat, a 454,000-square-foot, mixed-use district in Culver City. In late 2022, the Aware Super and Lendlease JV landed a $360 million loan for a 36-story, 834-unit multifamily development in Brooklyn. “Through deliberate sequencing we’re establishing our reputation and presence as a global asset owner,” Alek Misev, Aware Super’s head of property, said in reference to its new logistics platform with Goodman.

Title: Grassley, Durbin Take Aim at Tech, Finance and Retail Sectors for Favoring H-1B Visa Holders over American Workers

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/01/2025 10:14:25 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) are scrutinizing major corporations for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labor visa petitions after conducting mass layoffs of American employees. “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees.

According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

Title: First Brands’ Fall Renews Concerns Over Murky Trade Finance
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/first-brands-fall-renews-concerns-over-murky-trade-finance-11759335358613.html
Time Published: 2025-10-01T16:15:58Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- When the auto-parts supplier First Brands Group filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, one name popped up in the documents again and again: Raistone. The little-known firm helps businesses secure short-term financing as they wait for customer payments to come through or seek to delay paying suppliers. On Tuesday, the New York-based company let go dozens of its workers as the deals it worked on for First Brands came under scrutiny. The collapse of First Brands is only the most recent instance of a firm like Raistone facilitating apparently low-risk transactions that have led to problems for companies and lenders in what is known as trade finance. Late last year, a Raistone competitor, Stenn Technologies, collapsed in dramatic fashion after promoting mundane corporate lending products that proved to be anything but. The biggest bust in the industry came in 2021, when Greensill Capital filed for insolvency after channeling bank deposits and insurance funds into short-term loans to risky companies, ultimately contributing to the forced sale of Credit Suisse Group AG. Raistone has a working familiarity with these past problems. It offered to take on stranded clients of Stenn, and the founder of Raistone, Dave Skirzenski, was one of the first employees at Greensill. He left that firm years before it collapsed, and there are no allegations of wrongdoing against either Raistone or First Brands. A few of Raistone’s workers previously held positions at Stenn, according to a review of their LinkedIn profiles. The links between these disconnected corporate crashes underscore the questions surrounding the tools and platforms that offer companies easy access to short-term corporate financing, often tied to some promised future revenue. While intermediaries like Raistone and Greensill aim to make these markets more efficient and available to a wider array of businesses, they can end up obscuring some of the risks for borrowers, lenders and even the platforms themselves. The innovation in trade finance is “supposed to be good, but oftentimes, those financial innovations are being taken advantage of and companies kind of hide information, take on more risk,” said Ben Lourie, a professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine’s business school. “Sometimes that risk explodes,” he added. Raistone and First Brands both declined to comment. Warning Signals Regulators and accounting experts have sounded alarms for years about the growth of off-balance sheet financing techniques that companies use to manage their short-term cash flow. Transactions between investment-grade companies and lenders carry low risk, but cracks can emerge for businesses on shakier financial footing. The funding for these deals has largely come from asset managers and insurance companies, rather than the banks that used to provide it, creating additional visibility problems for investors and regulators. In 2022, after the collapse of Greensill, US accounting rulemakers required companies to disclose the size and key terms of one kind of financing offered by Greensill called supply chain financing, which generally involves taking out short-term loans to pay suppliers. Even with the new rules, though, many of First Brands’ creditors felt they were left in the dark leading up to the bankruptcy. The court filings this week are providing many lenders with the first real glimpse at what went wrong with First Brands, which saw the value of its loans drop by more than half in a matter of weeks after concerns began to circulate about its off-balance sheet financing. The Michigan-based company, which owns car parts brands such as Carter fuel pumps and Trico wiper blades, was thought to have about $6 billion in debt. But when it filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night, there were over $10 billion in outstanding liabilities, and just $1 billion to $10 billion of assets. The company is owned by a businessman who kept a low profile, Patrick James, and it channeled much of its financing through a network of intermediaries owned by James. Short-Term Cash While there’s no indication of wrongdoing, a newly appointed board committee is now investigating the company’s use of roughly $2.3 billion of off-balance sheet financing, Chief Restructuring Officer Charles Moore said in a court filing. Some of the inventory backing these facilities “may have been commingled” with collateral securing a separate asset-backed loan facility. The declaration filed on Tuesday morning showed that $2.3 billion of First Brands’ liabilities were tied to a practice known as factoring that can turn expected future income, like outstanding receipts, into immediate cash — a sort of corporate payday loan. An industry group, the Secured Finance Network, reported this week that the total funds in use in factoring rose 13% between the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. First Brands also owed another $800 million to creditors that offered supply-chain finance, the borrowing tool companies use to pay suppliers. Many of these arrangements ran through Raistone, which is listed as the point of contact for several of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, including the three largest, with combined claims of over half a billion dollars. While Raistone’s precise relationship to these creditors is not detailed in the documents, its website describes it as an administrator originating and placing such debt with its client investors. Unsecured Creditors Raistone was founded in 2017 by Skirzenski, who, in a 2020 interview, said that he imagined it as “the Amazon Web Services of trade finance,” standing in between the various players in the market. It advertises its services to companies that want to “get paid quickly without taking on debt,” and to investors looking to offer funding with a “short tenor,” “low default rates” and “no mark-to-market risk.” The company says it has offered nearly $15 billion in financing to date. While Raistone is typically only the intermediary in these transactions, it is also separately listed as one of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, for an “undetermined amount” tied to both factoring and supply-chain finance. Skirzenski would have been familiar with this mix of businesses at Greensill Capital, which he joined in 2013, according to his personal LinkedIn profile. After he left in 2017, Greensill grew into one of the hottest startups in the fintech industry, with a big investment from SoftBank Group Corp., ties to the highest ranks of the British government and a fleet of corporate jets. Greensill’s high profile founder, Lex Greensill, promoted the safe nature of his business lending against future cashflow, which appeared to be secured by the invoices themselves. However, it turned out that much of the money was lent against predicted future income, rather than actual invoices. This became a particular problem because Greensill’s business was largely concentrated on a handful of risky companies. Some of the same issues cropped up at Stenn, another UK trade finance fintech, though it also faced accusations of faked client lists and fraud. When Stenn went under last year, Raistone put up a website for “former Stenn clients left looking for an alternative” and promised interest rates as low as 6%. --With assistance from Lucca de Paoli.

Title: A Northwestern grad shares how she landed job interviews at Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and a tech role at Salesforce

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Karishma Mandal wanted to be at the center of the tech world — working in AI at a big-name company in San Francisco. So she moved across the country — and tapped every job search strategy in her toolbox, hoping to land an offer. Mandal's career journey — which would include interviews at Uber, Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce — began when she moved to the US from India in 2021 to pursue a master's in engineering management at Northwestern University. After graduating in January 2023, she began working full-time in March of that year as a product manager at a consulting firm in Chicago — before leaving for a senior product manager role at a healthcare company that November. The position was remote, with team members spread across the country. In her first few months on the job, Mandal said she missed working with people in person — and the time zone differences made it even harder to connect with colleagues. At the same time, she kept hearing about tech meetups and professional events happening regularly in San Francisco — opportunities she said were harder to find in Chicago. There was also the unavoidable buzz around generative AI, the future of which seemed increasingly centered in the Bay Area. San Francisco, she realized, was where she needed to be. So she started planning a move, with the goal of eventually landing an AI-focused role at a large tech company. "I felt like, as a tech person, I had to be in San Francisco," said the 29-year-old. But one big hurdle stood in the way of her plan: the tough tech job market. Mandal is among the many tech professionals who've struggled to find work or to change jobs in recent years. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the start of 2025, global tech companies — including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon — have collectively laid off more than 80,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have coincided with a broader slowdown in white-collar hiring. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are now hiring at nearly the slowest pace since 2014. Still, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Mandal shared how she landed interviews at several tech giants — and ultimately secured a role at Salesforce. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above. You can also find more of our job market coverage below: In May 2024, Mandal moved to San Francisco while continuing to work remotely for the healthcare company. She said she didn't start job hunting right away, in part because the move was overwhelming. There were boxes to unpack, and she didn't have any friends or family in the area. Instead, she focused on settling in and building her social and professional network from scratch. "When I came to San Francisco, I really had no one," she said. When Mandal began her job search in September 2024, she sensed the tech hiring landscape wasn't in her favor. To gain traction, she believed she needed to connect directly with hiring managers and recruiters. Rather than simply applying to job listings, she looked for people who were actively posting about open product manager roles on LinkedIn. One trick she used was searching "product manager + hiring" — a combination that filtered for posts containing both terms. Then she'd apply LinkedIn's "past 24 hours" filter to surface the newest listings. To take things a step further, she'd tweak the URL manually — changing the number of seconds from 86,400 (24 hours) to 3,600 (1 hour) — to see posts from the past hour. Once she found a post of interest, Mandal said she'd message the recruiter or hiring manager — explaining why she was interested in the role and why she thought she'd be a good fit. In addition to filtering LinkedIn posts, Mandal applied the same logic to the platform's job listings tab — using filters to uncover the newest openings. Based on conversations with recruiters and her network, she said she thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role. Many recruiters, she said, are far more likely to closely review the 20th application than the 200th or the 2,000th. Career experts previously told Business Insider that being among the first applicants could give candidates an edge. Mandal was also strategic about how she submitted applications. She said an HR professional at one company told her they prioritized applications submitted directly through their website over those sourced via LinkedIn — even if the candidate was redirected there from a LinkedIn post. Mandal figured following that advice couldn't hurt her chances. To get an extra edge, Mandal said she used the referral platform Refer.me to secure referrals for roles at McKinsey and Best Buy. A free account allows users to send one referral request a week to employees at a wide range of companies. "You have to be early, you have to be through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," Mandal said of her job search strategies. Over time, Mandal's job search strategies began to pay off. She said reaching out to an Amazon recruiter and an Uber hiring manager on LinkedIn — after seeing their posts about open roles — helped her secure interviews at both companies. A separate referral from a Meta employee — sourced outside Refer.me — led to another interview. Business Insider has verified her interview offers by reviewing emails she received from the respective companies. Mandal said her Uber interview included a case study involving AI tools built around user communication data, while Meta's featured questions about measuring the performance of AI features on Instagram. The Amazon interview, she said, focused more on the company's leadership principles. These interviews didn't ultimately lead to offers. But in late 2024, Mandal messaged a Salesforce recruiter on LinkedIn who had posted about an AI-related product manager role — and eventually heard back to schedule an interview. Over the next several weeks, Mandal said she went through a seven-round interview process that included a design exercise where she was asked to create an AI-powered lawn mower; conversations with the engineering, product, and AI teams; and a final interview with a senior leader. "They're not limited to behavioral questions," she said of Salesforce interviews. "Most hiring managers want to see real expertise." Mandal said she received an offer from Salesforce around the end of the year, which included a six-figure salary about 40% higher than what she earned in her previous role. She started full-time in January. While San Francisco's high cost of living has been frustrating at times, she said the career benefits have made relocating from Chicago worthwhile. "If you are trying to make a big career move in tech, I'd recommend living in San Francisco and seeing how you can leverage your network," she said. Jump to

Title: Walmart CEO expects AI will 'change literally every job' - not just engineering
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/walmart-ceo-expects-ai-will-change-literally-every-job-not-just-engineering/

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has good news and bad news for the more than two million global workers employed by his company. The bad news is that AI is rapidly going to transform all of those employees' roles, and soon. The good news is that, in his view, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be out of a job. Also: Nearly everything you've heard about AI and job cuts is wrong - here's why Speaking at a conference in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of Walmart's headquarters, last week, McMillon told the audience that it's by now "very clear that AI is going to change literally every job," according to a Friday report from The Wall Street Journal. Walmart is the largest employer in the world, so when McMillon unequivocally declares his conviction that AI is going to reshape his company from the ground up, that's a vision for the future with ramifications that will be felt by millions of workers globally, at every rung of the socioeconomic ladder. Thus far, many predictions about the potential for AI to transform the job market have focused on white-collar jobs, especially software engineering. Also: Will AI replace software engineers? It depends on who you ask It's true that the growing availability and sophistication of AI coding tools does seem to be one of the factors that's been making it more difficult for young computer science grads to find work in the tech industry. At the same time, however, the race among tech companies to build ever-more powerful AI models has also sparked a talent war that has hugely inflated the salaries of some of the industry's more established engineers. Some new AI tools, especially those that are designed to generate video, could also replace many creative roles in industries like filmmaking and advertising. Also: OpenAI tested GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini on real-world tasks - the results were surprising McMillon's prediction, however, paints a much more unilateral and democratic picture of the future of AI-powered automation: it isn't just salaried office workers who will feel the effects of AI, but also warehouse workers, checkout cashiers, and millions of others, many of whom are already working paycheck-to-paycheck. That said, his vision for the future is more about transformation than replacement. In his view, as business leaders rush to onboard new AI tools, they also have a responsibility to provide the requisite upskilling to workers. "We've got to create the opportunity for everybody to make it to the other side," he said at the Bentonville conference. Also: Got AI skills? You can earn 43% more in your next job - and not just for tech work This language portrays AI not as a giant ax that will cleave many workers from their livelihoods, but as a moment of societal change -- a chasm which executives should help their employees cross safely. In the absence of robust federal oversight of AI, the onus of responsibility for managing the technology's impacts upon the labor market will likely fall disproportionately on employers' shoulders. The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, a set of policies released earlier this summer, emphasized AI upskilling without outlining any protections for workers displaced by the technology. McMillon's stance is supported by recent data from Indeed, which indicates that AI is transforming specific job requirements more than it's replacing jobs themselves. Similarly, a recent report shared exclusively with ZDNET found that only 11% of executives surveyed believe that AI will significantly reduce their workforce, while 84% said they expect the technology to alter the nature of existing roles within their companies. Elsewhere, recent research from OpenAI found several frontier models performed competitively with human experts on economically viable work tasks that contribute to US GDP. Also: The best free AI courses and certificates in 2025 - and I've tried many In that same vein, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon (the second-biggest employer in the world) recently told CNBC that AI will lead to "fewer people doing some of the jobs," while also creating new ones.

She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs. Bosses have spent the better part of two years summoning their employees back to the office, making remote-loving workers “quiet quit” in protest, while others have threatened to quit for real. But that’s secretly what a significant chunk of CEOs were hoping for. According to research from BambooHR, a survey of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found a quarter of C-suite executives hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing a return-to-office (RTO) policy. Meanwhile, one in five HR professionals admitted their in-office policy was meant to make staff quit. It’s why the report concludes what many workers have long suspected: that “RTO mandates are layoffs in disguise.” It’s no secret that rigid in-office policies haven’t landed well with workers. Amazon is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get. Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand. When the tech giant eventually demanded workers show face in the office five days a week, numerous staffers told Fortune they were immediately updating their LinkedIn profiles and “rage applying” for new jobs. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” one person said. Research has shown 99% of companies with RTO mandates have seen a drop in engagement. Meanwhile, separate data shows that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. BambooHR’s research has further highlighted that nearly a third of workers would consider leaving their positions if forced to return to their company’s towers. But in reality, many workers aren’t following through with such threats—and fewer are quitting than bosses had hoped. Nearly 40% of all managers in the survey said they believe their organization did layoffs because not enough workers quit in response to their company’s RTO mandate.

Title: US senators target H-1B, L-1 visa loopholes in new bipartisan reform bill

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/30/2025 5:13:28 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Two of the US Senate’s most senior lawmakers are once again teaming up to overhaul America’s high-skilled H-1B and L-1 visa systems, saying companies have turned what was meant to be a tool for innovation into a loophole for outsourcing. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. This latest push comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping presidential proclamation on H-1B visa applications. Under the new order, companies are now required to pay a one-time fee of $100,000 (around Rs 88 lakh) on every new H-1B visa application. Earlier, the senators sent letters to 10 major employers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, questioning why they were filing thousands of visa petitions even as they laid off American employees. "Congress created the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes as limited pathways for businesses to acquire top talent when it can’t be found at home," Grassley said in a statement. "But over the years, many employers have used them to cut out American workers in favour of cheap foreign labour. Congress must step in again to bring integrity back to these programmes and restore dignity for American and foreign workers," he added. Durbin repeated the concern, pointing to mass layoffs in tech. "Major companies are laying off thousands of American workers while filing thousands of visa petitions for foreign workers at depressed wages and poor working conditions," he said. "Congress must step in to protect American workers and fix our broken immigration system." (Excerpt) Read more at indiatoday.in ...

"Congress created the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes as limited pathways for businesses to acquire top talent when it can’t be found at home," Grassley said in a statement. "But over the years, many employers have used them to cut out American workers in favour of cheap foreign labour. Congress must step in again to bring integrity back to these programmes and restore dignity for American and foreign workers," he added. Durbin repeated the concern, pointing to mass layoffs in tech. "Major companies are laying off thousands of American workers while filing thousands of visa petitions for foreign workers at depressed wages and poor working conditions," he said.

Title: EA’s $55 Billion Buyout Sets New ‘Going Private’ High Score

The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Video game-maker Electronic Arts has agreed to go private for $55 billion in the biggest-ever buyout of a public company. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, along with private equity firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, will pay $210 per share to EA’s investors. That’s nearly 25% more than what the stock was worth before The Wall Street Journal reported details of the deal on Friday. EA has been making popular titles like “The Sims” and “Madden NFL” for decades. But recent years have left the company floundering like a Sim in a pool with no ladder. The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass, en masse, again. EA contracted with the broader industry, reducing its workforce through several rounds of layoffs, shutting down development studios and canceling games. The company’s stock experienced its biggest single-day slide in 17 years in January after executives slashed annual bookings guidance. The problem: Free-to-play games like “Fortnite” dominate the gaming industry, not $80 console titles. Plus, games like EA’s upcoming “Battlefield 6” are under immense pressure to succeed since they cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. So EA’s switching its focus: Pressing Buttons: The massive buyout of EA could spark investor interest in gaming companies: Shares of EA and other gaming companies, including Take-Two and Roblox, rose yesterday. But the deal has a vital level to complete first: regulatory approval. Regulators may question whether the Saudi fund’s involvement raises national security concerns. EA’s games have a trove of data on American gamers that goes beyond their “Battlefield” kill/death ratios. The Saudi fund has been expanding its gaming interests with sizable stakes in EA and rival gaming company Take-Two Interactive, as well as acquiring the gaming division of Pokémon Go-maker Niantic. Saudi Arabia also hosted the Esports World Cup last year. Universal and Warner are said to be pushing AI startups to develop an attribution system that can track when an artists’ music is used. Lame duck Disney CEO Bob Iger will likely have his hands full with pressure from regulators and investors in his remaining days on the job. Tying its various advertising tech services together has allowed Google to snare roughly 20% of each dollar that moves through its platforms. Lachlan Murdoch’s moves so far are clearly those of someone who came of age during an era of rapidly advancing digitization. Whether it pursues the box office or not, Netflix is clearly interested in catering to the extroverts among us. ESPN’s standalone streaming service is finally here, but it’s core audience may have already found a preferred way to watch sports. Advertising companies are scrambling to make changes as their businesses get hammered by advances in artificial intelligence. Vegas has been dealing with the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s trade, tariff and immigration policies. Revenue from theme parks in the US rose 10% to $6.4 billion, with passenger cruises and resort stays registering higher turnout. Warner Bros. Discovery entered the year stuck in media conglomerate mud, with its eponymous film studio in especially bad shape. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Whether that nets out to a head count reduction or an increase at any given company ultimately boils down to a few factors, Meta's CMO says. Alex Schultz has worked at Meta for almost two decades, starting at Facebook as an analyst and working his way up to chief marketing officer. The company has undergone significant changes over the years, from a pandemic-era hiring boom to layoffs during Mark Zuckerberg's "year of efficiency" and, most recently, a costly AI poaching spree. On "The A16z Podcast," Schultz said that there were three factors determining whether AI would cause companies to grow or shrink their workforce. First, Schultz said that AI would enable workers to perform existing tasks more efficiently — something that could lead to a company's headcount shrinking. "Existing stuff is going to be done more efficiently with AI as it exists today," Schultz said. "A lot of stuff can be automated, a lot of stuff can be done more efficiently. So that work, there will be less of it." There are already signs of that playing out at some major tech giants. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that he expected AI efficiency gains to reduce the company's corporate workforce. These AI efficiency cuts are leading to what some refer to as the "Great Shrinking." On the other side of the equation are work-creating possibilities from AI advancements. Schultz's second factor is the creation of work that was previously unimaginable. "Things that literally weren't possible before will become possible," he said. "That can open up a lot more jobs." Schultz used the example of "semantic understanding of content," which bettered content ranking and could not exist without AI. A handful of previously unheard-of job titles have emerged from the AI boom. AI trainers are earning lucrative contracts, while prompt engineers are discerning the best ways to interact with AI. Some companies are hiring guidance positions to vet AI vendors and explain tools to the workforce. Schultz's third factor surrounds cost-prohibitive work. AI may open up the possibility for these new projects. "Things that were possible, but just were really effing expensive, suddenly become over the threshold of reasonable to do," he said. Schultz uses the example of support chatbots. Before, you could have built a customer support bot, Schultz said, but it was "prohibitively expensive." Now, AI can do it — and people can build the system, creating new work. How it ultimately shakes out at a company comes down to the result of that equation. Will the head count shrinkage from efficiency gains outweigh the growth from new (or newly affordable) work growth? Answering that will determine the labor outcomes, Schultz said. That is, if artificial general intelligence (AGI) doesn't come first, which Schultz said would disrupt the full equation. "It depends how weird you think it's going to get," he said. Jump to

Title: Companies Are Lying About AI Layoffs

Companies are saying that the economy and AI are causing the large amount of tech layoffs, but Vanessa Wingårdh looked at the H-1B visa data and noticed that the companies are lying. She argues that the American employees are being replaced by cheaper H-1B visa workers. WSJ also reported on this due to some senators speaking up. As proof she uses the H-1B data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. When filtering by fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the number of Beneficiaries Approved for some of the big corporations as of 30 June 2025 are shown in the second column below. I also searched a bit for news articles about layoffs and put those numbers in the third column. A commenter on Hacker News writes: "You can go on Blind, Fishbowl, any work related subreddit, etc. and hear the same story over and over and over - 'My company replaced half my department with H1Bs or simply moved it to an offshore center in India, and then on the next earnings call announced that they had replaced all those jobs with AI'." I searched a bit to verify these claims and it seems plausible since I could without much effort find a report from Boeing in the 2000s, and that indeed the replacing of US workers by H-1Bs seems commonly agreed upon here, here, and here. Another commenter pointed out that Accenture proposed hiring 12,000 employees in a new campus in India.
