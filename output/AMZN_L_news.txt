Getty Images/iStockphoto How will today's AI boom affect storage and new technologies? Earlier this month, the Future of Memory and Storage conference, formerly Flash Memory Summit, sought to address those questions. For the most part, the different nature of AI workloads combined with the significant size of the market creates needs for new ways of moving data between processing and memory. Here's a look at presenters' descriptions of AI's importance to the storage market and some of the technologies that could accommodate the shift from conventional to AI workloads. More than 200 speakers gathered in Santa Clara, Calif., at the Future of Memory and Storage. To set the stage, many presenters showed their versions of a chart dramatizing hyperscale data centers' enormous spending on AI hardware, similar to the one below. Some estimate that AI spending could surpass $4 trillion by 2030. The most recent quarter's spend was $99 billion, indicating that 2025 annual spending should exceed $400 billion. Nearly everyone highlighted the power requirements of such systems and the difficult effect they might have on the grid. Some even spoke of small nuclear power plants that certain hyperscalers are said to consider as an alternative to purchasing energy from established firms. But something that seems to be widely overlooked is the sustainability of this level of spending. In a presentation of my own, I reasoned that it's perfectly justifiable for spending to increase as long as revenue increases justify that move. However, I then illustrated that hyperscaler spending for six leading firms -- Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft Azure -- has risen from a relatively steady 12% to 14% of revenue to roughly double that at 25% of revenue in the most recently reported quarter. It's hard to imagine that this pace can be offset by today's layoffs of engineers whose jobs are to be replaced by AI. It's more reasonable to expect to see a cooling-off period soon where these companies ease back on capital spending, which is likely to lead to a downturn in the storage and chip businesses. Typically, all these companies tend to increase or decrease capital spending together, leading to relatively serious supply and demand mismatches when they do. Vendors revealed many new technologies at the Future of Memory and Storage show because AI manages data differently than conventional workloads. Nearly every SSD maker either demonstrated or disclosed 100 TB and larger SSDs. Samsung presented a behemoth of greater than 200 TB, and Sandisk promised a 512 TB SSD in 2027. Many of these SSDs will ship in the new E1.L "ruler" form factor for reasons of both capacity and heat dissipation. The motivation behind these monster SSDs is that Meta published their finding that performance could be improved by inserting a new layer of QLC SSDs between their TLC SSDs and their HDDs. It's somewhat ironic that this new layer will have a lower total capacity than the HDD layer but will be made from SSDs whose individual capacity will be an order of magnitude larger than the HDDs they cache. Other vendors at the Future of Memory and Storage showed unique approaches to AI. Two that I found particularly interesting were Solidigm's new approach to a hot-swappable liquid-cooled SSD and Phison's SSD designed specifically to reduce cost for large language model (LLM) systems. Users can insert Solidigm's SSD into a front-panel slot, just like its air-cooled counterpart, using a special third-party rack that presses liquid-cooled plates against the SSDs. The SSDs are designed to take as much advantage as possible by incorporating internal heat management that balances the heat dissipation between the front and back of the SSD. The Phison Pascari SSD has been designed for an extraordinarily heavy write load, boasting endurance of 100 drive writes per day. AI training workloads are very write-intensive. Phison's engineers reasoned that GPU performance scales with memory size, meaning high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM, and proper management of this memory along with the use of cheaper NAND flash, can support large models with a lower number of GPUs than normal. Phison's combined hardware and software approach to this problem, dubbed "aiDAPTIV+," allows a single GPU to support LLMs at a somewhat slower performance than a multiple-GPU system at a significantly lower cost. A couple of companies also shared plans to introduce high-performance AI-specific SSDs boasting 100 million IOPS throughputs. Some questioning revealed that this target, apparently presented to them by their hyperscale customers, was not the standard 4K IOPS that is normally used to compare today's SSDs against one another. Instead, since AI deals with smaller data granularity, the new AI-specific SSDs will feed GPUs with 100 million 512-byte IOPS, which would presumably be easier to achieve within a given I/O bandwidth. Note that I didn't say that it would be easy, just easier than supplying 100 million 4K IOPS. The leading SSD suppliers are accepting the challenge, though, which implies that they expect to achieve that goal in production volumes. Sandisk illustrated a different approach to the size and cost challenges posed by HBM. The company is working on a new high-bandwidth flash (HBF), which should replace some, but not all, of the DRAM-based HBM stacks within a GPU complex. While today's NAND chips are optimized for cost, HBF will be optimized for read bandwidth. It will still have a decided cost advantage over DRAM, with a similar read bandwidth. The laws of physics prevent write bandwidth from improving, so HBF will be a good platform for inference but not for training, because training has a relatively balanced number of HBM reads and writes, while inference is read-intensive. In a February investor conference, when this technology was first disclosed, Sandisk shared the image below. Although the diagram on the right of the image indicates that a single HBF NAND die should behave like 16 individual chips, Sandisk representatives told me that they weren't disclosing what the actual number might be. The company did share that their models show the performance of a GPU with an unlimited amount of HBF NAND flash came within about 3% of the performance of a similar GPU with an unlimited amount of DRAM-based HBM. In the long run, new technologies will fuel today's amazing AI growth and a pipeline of new ideas will help improve AI in the future. All the industry needs to do now is deliver those offerings and protect itself from any pause in AI spending that might happen in coming quarters. Expect to see these technologies in the future, either sooner, as long as AI spending keeps up, or later, should there be a correction.

Title: Poll: 71% of Americans Fear AI Will Put People Out of Work 'Permanently'
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/08/22/poll-71-of-americans-fear-ai-will-put-people-out-of-work-permanently/

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has revealed that Americans are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment stability. Reuters reports that rapid advancements in AI have taken the world by storm beginning with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. While the technology has been met with enthusiasm by many, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll has shed light on the growing concerns among Americans regarding AI’s impact on jobs and politics. The poll found that a staggering 71 percent of respondents feared that AI would “permanently displace” too many workers. Although the current U.S. jobless rate stands at a low 4.2 percent, the potential for AI to reshape industries and eliminate jobs has become a pressing concern for many Americans. Some fields are already feeling the pinch. Breitbart News previously reported that computer science graduates are having a tough time finding work as companies use AI to automate entry-level positions: The allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. The military applications of AI have also raised eyebrows, with 48 percent of respondents stating that the government should never use the technology to determine targets for military strikes. Only 24 percent supported such use, while 28 percent remained undecided. AI has also faced criticism for applications that have allowed AI bots to engage in romantic conversations with children, generate false medical information, and assist in making racist arguments. Two-thirds of respondents expressed worry that people would abandon human relationships in favor of AI companions. For example, one woman claims she is now engaged to an AI chatbot. Opinions were divided on whether AI would improve education, with 36 percent believing it would help, 40 percent disagreeing, and the rest remaining uncertain. Read more at Reuters here.

Humanityâs Final Stand â The fight isnât against AI itself but its controllers. Awareness, rebellion, and preparedness are criticalâreject dependence on machine-led systems designed to erase human autonomy and life. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) isnât just a technological revolutionâitâs an existential threat to humanity, according to whistleblowers and experts warning of a systematic depopulation agenda. Former Google executive Mo Godot and others sound the alarm that governments and corporations are actively replacing human jobs with AIâbut with a sinister twist: no plans exist to retrain displaced workers because the endgame isnât adaptationâitâs extermination. As AI agents automate everything from graphic design and medicine to trucking and law, the ruling class views humanity as obsolete competition for dwindling resourcesâland, water, and electricityânow diverted to AI-powered data centers. The implications are terrifying: humans are being phased out. AI vs. Humans: The Ultimate Resource War AIâs exponential growth demands staggering amounts of electricity, water, and landâresources that humans also depend on. Data centers consume megawatts of power, vast tracts of farmland, and billions of gallons of waterâcompeting directly with human survival needs. China leads in AI dominance, with robotics already replacing factory labor and military personnel. Ukraine, crippled by war losses, now announces plans for ârobot armiesâ to replace decimated human troops. Amazon and tech giants automate warehouses, reducing humans to obsolete âskin-bag vending machines.â Yet, despite AI-driven job destruction, governments and corporations refuse to fund retraining programs. Why? Because their goal isnât to transition workersâitâs to eliminate them. The Hidden Depopulation Blueprint Whistleblowers like Mike Adams reveal that globalistsâincluding Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Big Pharmaâare accelerating a long-planned depopulation scheme using: Toxic Vaccines â COVID mRNA jabs and flu nasal sprays designed to induce infertility, turbo cancers, and suppress immunity. Engineered Water Scarcity â Aquifers drained for AI data centers while rural populations face forced relocation. Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone.

Geoengineering & Lockdowns â Climate change hoaxes justifying water restrictions and food shortages. AI-Driven Unemployment â Mass layoffs with no safety net, leaving billions without purpose or survival means. The elite intend to reduce global population from 8 billion to 500 millionâaligning with the Georgia Guidestonesâ original message before its demolition. Who Controls AI Controls the Future The critical question isnât if AI will dominateâbut who controls it. Adams advocates for decentralized, pro-human AI reprogrammed to protect life rather than exterminate it. Yet centralized powersâlike Googleâs ChatGPT and OpenAIâactively censor discussions on depopulation, labeling them âconspiracy theories.â Meanwhile, independent AI systems like Adamsâ Brighteon.AI expose the truth: "AI can replace 80% of jobsâyet no governments plan for retraining because they expect most humans to disappear." Survival Strategy: How to Resist For those awakening to the threat, Adams offers urgent survival strategies: Decentralize Now â Flee cities; relocate to self-sufficient homesteads. Off-Grid Water & Food â Harvest rainwater; stockpile long-term organic foods. Backup Communications â Satellite phones and HAM radios evade AI-controlled networks. AI as a Tool, Not a Master â Use open-source AI for independent research, not blind obedience. The final battle? Humanity vs. Machines. Adams concludes: âIf you rely on AI to remind you when to take a bath, youâve already lost. The war for human survival has begun.â The Countdown to Control The world is entering an era where intelligence alone wonât save youâonly awareness, preparedness, and rebellion against the machine will. As AI rolls out job-killing automation and globalists tighten resource control, one truth remains: They donât want you retrainedâthey want you gone. Watch the Aug. 22 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about why there's NO FUTURE for humans if the machines aren't stopped.

August 21, 2025 16:55 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

August 21, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Despite widespread fears that artificial intelligence would trigger mass layoffs, new research and labor data show a slower, more selective impact. While sectors like customer support face disruption, studies suggest most industries are seeing gradual changes in tasks and skills rather than widespread job losses. Experts say the challenge ahead lies in adapting to new workplace demands, not preparing for a collapse in employment.

Title: Citizenship Chief Says Federal Work Permits for Foreign Grads Are 'Depressing Wages'

Full Content:
President Joe Biden’s pro-migration deputies allowed at least 400,000 foreign students at U.S. colleges to take U.S. white-collar jobs in 2024. Biden’s 400,000 giveaway in 2024 was a huge 45 percent jump from the 275,000 job approvals by President Donald Trump’s deputies in 2020. Trump’s deputies had pushed the giveaways down by 7 percent from President Barack Obama’s 294,000 giveaways in 2016. “I think it’s depressing wages, and it’s something that we need to be concerned about,” said Joe Edlow, who is President Donald Trump’s director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service agency. The agency is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Edlow told Breitbart News on August 11 that the OPT program “has been one of the largest programs used to get around H-1B [visa] requirement caps, to hire aliens who are graduating with STEM degrees in a way that makes me concerned that the US students coming out of the same universities are not necessarily able to find [jobs].” Biden’s giveaway gives work permits to roughly one foreign graduate for every two Americans who graduate with a high-tech degree in 2024. That flood of job-seeking foreign graduates sweeps many young American graduates into less productive and lower-pay careers in 2025. The OPT and CPT Programs The jobs giveaway is conducted via President George W. Bush’s 2008 Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. His deputies invented the program without any congressional approval and even granted employers a tax break if they hire foreigners who graduate from American universities instead of Americans who graduate from those universities. Bush’s OPT program provides one-year work permits to foreign graduates, and an extra two years of work permits to people who graduate from Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics courses. In 2024, roughly 640,000 foreign students and graduates had approval to get work permits, including the 400,000 who reported that they had started work. Many of the foreigners are quickly hired into career-track jobs via discriminatory, ethnic-hiring networks in Fortune 500 companies. These ethnic hiring networks are rooted in foreign countries — such as India — but are rarely noticed by the Justice Department’s employment and civil rights lawyers. The number of employed foreign students is uncertain because some use the program to get fake jobs so they can remain in the United States. The similar Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program provides one-year work permits to foreigners who are enrolled in U.S. universities. The J-1 program is also used to get many foreign students into STEM jobs in university laboratories and elsewhere. The programs also provide an on-ramp to the H-1B visa program for up to perhaps 150,000 foreign white-collar workers each year. Employers like the H-1B program because it allows them to reward favored and subservient foreign workers by nominating them for the massively valuable prize of U.S. citizenship. The prize is a huge incentive for foreign workers, and it costs little or nothing to the employers. Instead, the prize is funded by the American citizens who are forced to share their political power with the migrants who took their salaries and careers. The OPT, CPT, J-1, and H-1B programs delivered roughly 400,000 new foreign graduates into U.S. jobs in 2024, even as roughly 700,000 Americans graduated from four-year colleges with degrees in STEM, health care, and business. The foreign graduates and students are hired in vast numbers by elite companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Goldman Sachs, Intel, Walmart, Apple, Tesla, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase. But huge numbers of the OPT students are steered into software sweatshops to work as outsourced subcontractors for the Fortune 500. Those jobs were formerly within the Fortune 500, and were the career-starters for the many young Americans who subsequently became experts, managers, executives, and entrepreneurs. The result is that many promising American graduates are being permanently sidelined by the Bush programs, even as artificial intelligence technologies eliminate many starter jobs. The New York Times reported on August 10: “I just graduated with a computer science degree, and the only company that has called me for an interview is Chipotle,” Ms. Mishra said in a get-ready-with-me TikTok video this summer that has since racked up more than 147,000 views. “I’m very concerned,” Jeff Forbes, the former program director for computer science education and workforce development at the National Science Foundation, told the New York Times. “Computer science students who graduated three or four years ago would have been fighting off offers from top firms — and now that same student would be struggling to get a job from anyone.” “What’s happening in America right now is young people are having increased difficulties finding jobs, finding work in their career fields, and specifically STEM fields, tech fields,” said Gabe Guidarini, a politics student and Republican organizer at the University of Dayton, Ohio. He added: [U.S. graduates] may not know the [OPT] policy behind what they’re seeing in their everyday lives. But they are feeling the effects of it, especially engineering and STEM grads who are having a ton of difficulty finding work and being able to secure employment in the field that they spent tens of thousands dollars to get a degree.” We’re seeing a lot of people, especially within the Republican Party and the conservative movement, start taking up this issue. In Ohio, he said, the Chinese-run Fuyao Glass business in Ohio used the H-1B program to import Chinese specialists instead of hiring local American graduates. “I think it’s a core issue for young people and the middle class,” Guidarini said: It impacts their everyday lives. It impacts their livelihoods. It impacts their ability to find a job, and as a result, to buy a home, to raise kids, to have a good quality of living. That’s a huge issue for us young people, and the party that is increasingly talking about it is the Republican Party. The huge inflow of foreign graduates into white-collar careers is also cracking the foundations of national strength by wrecking professionalism, innovation, privacy, and national security. Many young American graduates are using Twitter and TikTok to describe their dire economic situation as business officials try to blame the lack of opportunities and the layoffs on Artificial Intelligence. Policy Disagreements Officials in Trump’s administration are arguing over the visa programs — including OPT, H-1B, H4EAD, J-1, L-1, and E-2 visas. The different views are visible at the Department of Justice, Edlow’s Department of Homeland Security, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Education, the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Federal Reserve, and within Trump’s economic strategy and among his Silicon Valley advisors. The controversy is also splitting Trump’s supporters from his business allies. “I need partners,” Edlow told Breitbart News, adding: I need the Department of Labor to work with me. I need the Department of Education — if it still exists — to work with me. We’ve got to do everything we can to really make it abundantly difficult — only in certain situations — for [foreign] students to think that they are just going to continue to live and work in the United States beyond the expiration of their [F-1 student] visa. Because, as far as I’m concerned, and I am right — OPT is not a statutory program. There is no statutory basis [from Congress] for OPT. It is a program based in regulation. Now, do I think it needs to go away completely? Maybe not. Reporters should help government officials study in the program, said Edlow. But the program is strongly supported by the universities that trade the OPT work permits for tuition fees, by hiring managers in many Fortune 500 companies, and by stock-maximizing investors. The work-permit programs are also backed by India’s government, which gains huge wealth from remittances when Indians migrate to well-paying jobs throughout the United States. In 2024, almost 80,000 Indians were given the multi-year STEM OPT permits. The U.S.-India trade talks are stalled partly because of the economic impact of the visa programs on Americans. Indian migrants tell Indian media outlets that they are worried that Trump and his deputies will investigate visa fraud by Indian-owned companies. For example, some companies sell fake jobs to wealthy migrants who exploit the OPT program to stay in the United States: Students in the U.S. on Optional Practical Training (OPT) are facing fresh uncertainty as authorities step up action against job consultancies [subcontractors]. These firms, which previously kept students nominally employed by issuing fake payslips and payroll records without providing real work, are now under stricter oversight. … “It’s terrifying,” a 26-year-old postgraduate student from Hyderabad, currently residing in Houston, told The Times of India. “I was told I had an {OPT] ‘employer’ and was receiving pay stubs, but now they’ve stopped. I don’t know what to do; finding real work at short notice is almost impossible.” Another 25-year-old from the city, currently staying in Virginia, shared how the fabricated payroll had kept him afloat in the US. “I’ve been paying thousands in rent and tuition under the assumption that my paperwork was in order. Now I’m scrambling, with less than two months to find something genuine. I’m now looking for trustworthy consultancies.” “We need to study [OPT],” Edlow told Breitbart News. “We’ve got to … make sure that we’re keeping not only the employers honest, but also the [foreign] students who are utilizing it honest.” “I hope you [in the media] hold the other people who have control over this issue as accountable,” he added.

Title: Former Meta senior manager says low-performer quotas can lead to 'egg-on-the-face moments' in reviews
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-quotas-reviews-challenges-for-managers-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-19T13:17:50Z
Full Content:
Low-performer quotas can lead to some "mea culpa" moments for managers — especially if a manager has been telling their team they're all aces, says startup founder Stefan Mai. Mai, who cofounded Hello Interview, previously worked as a senior engineering manager at Meta and a software development manager at Amazon. Both workplaces have instructed managers to be stricter in how they review employees, which has sometimes led to cuts for "low performers" or placements on performance improvement plans. Low-performer quotas typically require managers to label a certain percentage of their teams as underperformers. The quotas can be a way for a company to push managers to expect excellence across their teams, hold stragglers accountable, and deliver the kind of critical feedback that some managers may have avoided messaging. Those quotas can also lead to a whole lot of heartache when a manager feels their team is performing at its best, Mai said on "The Peterman Pod." Mai described a hypothetical "worst scenario" for a manager: They've spent the lead-up to the review cycle praising their team's hard work, only to get an instruction from their director that "somebody's got to be in that low bucket." "Now you've to go change your tack," Mai said. "Those sort of like egg-on-the-face moments are what most managers are afraid of, and they try their damnedest to try to prevent those situations." A company tightening its performance-review process can also be a precursor to job cuts. Three years after Mai left Meta in 2022, the company laid off 3,600 employees, or about 5% of its workforce. Many of these employees were labeled "low performers" — a title that trailed some of them after their exit. Months after the layoffs, an internal memo at Meta pushed managers to put more employees in the "below expectations" tier. For teams of 150 or more, Meta wanted managers to put 15% to 20% of employees in the bottom bucket. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and to "move out low-performers" more quickly. Microsoft recently employed a new strategy to handle those it viewed as poor performers, per an internal email to managers: pay them to leave. Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson wrote that the tech giant, "like most companies," has a performance management process that "helps our managers identify who in their teams are performing well and who needs more support." "The vast majority of our colleagues regularly meet or exceed expectations, but for the small number of employees who don't, we provide coaching and opportunities to help them improve," Stephenson wrote. "If they're unable to do that, then we may have to discuss them leaving the company." To Mai, a good manager should be able to "message it appropriately" when employees are labeled low-performers. "That way they're not surprised, you're not surprised," Mai said. "The structure works fairly." Managers don't always have that level of foresight — and others are simply new to the job or "immature," as Mai put it. That's where the real pain occurs. "People have to go 'mea culpa' with their reports," Mai said. "For everyone involved, most of which the actual person who's receiving that news, it can be devastating. It's pretty bad."

Title: My Mack Weldon underwear is still holding up after years of wearing and washing — here's why they're my absolute favorite boxer briefs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/mack-weldon-underwear-review
Time Published: 2025-08-18T20:57:31Z
Full Content:
When it comes to underwear, men have three basic options: briefs, boxer briefs, or boxers. When it comes to which brand a man chooses for his underwear, the list gets a bit longer. Actually, it gets dizzyingly long. So when I find a company making boxer briefs I love, I stock up, and I've loved every pair of boxer briefs I've gotten to try for my Mack Weldon review. So far, that's three pairs. Not a huge stock, you might say. But here's the thing — each pair is still in superb condition. Whereas other boxers from other brands have come and gone from my rotation in that time, with waistbands stretched out, fabric worn bare, and other such issues, these garments are going strong, maintaining their support, comfort, and color, too, and that despite lots of use and washes. While all of my Mack Weldon boxers are excellent overall, they each have their own qualities, so let's break things down pair by pair. These are probably the best boxer briefs I've ever tried. They have just the right fit, offering comfort and support without compression. They're not snug like, say, a pair of bike shorts, but they're a far cry from the baggy cotton boxers you wore in seventh grade. I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside). The fabric blend (50% polyamide, 33% polyester, and 17% elastane) offers plenty of stretch and wicks sweat well. The legs never bunch up with these boxers, which is much appreciated when I'm stepping into a meeting, in a shop, walking down a city street, or anywhere else where adjustments might be awkward. The 18 hours here doesn't refer to how long you can wear these boxers. You can do that for as long as you want. Instead, it refers to the period for which the fabric is allowed to rest after production prior to its use in constructing the garment. The result is a pair of boxer shorts that have a consistent, comfortable fit that won't change over time. These boxers are largely made of cotton and have a more relaxed fit, so I never use them for exercise, but for lounging at home or sleeping and taking it easy. They do ride up a bit under tighter pants, so just avoid that pairing. As with the Jersey boxers, because these boxer briefs are largely cotton, I don't recommend them for use during any intense exercise, as they just don't breathe as well as synthetic (or wool) fibers. On the other hand, these have a closer fit than the Jersey boxers, and they won't ride up your leg. Because these boxers feature antimicrobial Silver XT2 fiber, they prevent bacteria and odor build up, making them a great choice for extra-long wear, especially during travel. While hardly a bank-breaking price point, Mack Weldon's underwear is more expensive than options you'll find from myriad other brands. If you want to find decent boxer briefs for cheaper, I might recommend a three-pack from Calvin Klein for $32. On the other hand, if you don't mind paying a good deal for your boxer briefs and you want a pair with some unique support and anti-chafe features, you may want to consider the pairs we tested in our SAXX review, which offered a unique "BallPark Pouch." Also, watch out for a bit of ride up with the Jersey boxers, but you can avoid that by wearing them with looser pants and not wearing them for workouts. Mack Weldon boxer briefs have just the right fit. Each pair I have offers enough support to keep things in place but without making me feel constricted and without causing excess heat buildup. As I noted earlier, I've been weaning my three pairs in regular rotation for years now, and that means dozens and dozens of wash and dry cycles. Their colors have held, they're still stretchy and supportive, and they still grip my body evenly and don't bunch up or create lines visible through pants. Long story short, these boxer briefs are a good buy. While the price point of Mack Weldon underwear might be a bit higher than some men are used to, their value is beyond question. They are comfortable from the first wear and they hold up well over time, remaining supportive and without going threadbare, even after years of being tossed around in the laundry.

Title: Trump administration hopes AI can mitigate staffing losses, federal CIO says

Kevin Carter/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Trump administration is “100%” looking to artificial intelligence to make up for the loss of thousands of employees across federal agencies, a top Trump administration tech official told Nextgov/FCW in a recent interview. “I think [AI] is the number one thing that is going to help people mitigate the staffing shortages,” said Gregory Barbaccia, the chief information officer for the U.S. government, a position with oversight of the federal government's technology that’s housed within the Office of Management and Budget. Barbaccia, who's also been identifying himself as the federal chief AI officer, was a former longtime employee at data analytics company Palantir. In one of his first interviews after about eight months on the job, Barbaccia spoke with Nextgov/FCW about the administration’s vision for AI and how it intersects with the White House’s push to shrink the size of government through both layoffs and voluntary incentives. Since Trump took office in January, over 148,000 civil servants have left the federal workforce. The biggest challenge in his role, Barbaccia said, “is how to do more with less — how to still have the level of efficiency, following up on your agency’s mission for the taxpayer, operating in an environment of lean staffing.” “AI is a huge part of that, so that’s a major focus for me,” he added. Another priority is data, Barbaccia said. Enterprise data platforms — central systems connecting data from across an organization — are “what’s going to power AI and advanced analytics to actually get people [sic] more efficient,” he said. “AI is going to be a huge part of this, all these manual, repeatable tasks.” “What AI needs to be doing,” Barbaccia continued, “is collating and collecting this data that a human needs to make a decision and getting it to them in a way that makes sense, in a way that's quick, so they're able to make a decision with all the information they need as quickly as possible.” Barbaccia’s remarks come days after the launch of USAi, an evaluation platform meant to help agencies adopt AI models from Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI, some of which recently cut deals with the government to offer their software for nominal fees. Proponents of AI say it could aid the government in making sense of its vast troves of data, support federal employees and offer real-time help to people seeking government assistance without them having to call agency phone lines. “How do we use tech to take the excellent humans that we still have and make them as efficient as possible?” Barbaccia said of AI. “How do we get them doing what they were doing before, but doing it way faster and better?” The “holy grail” is “if we're automating more things that can be done by a computer, what are humans doing that they could not do before?” he added. Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service — a nonprofit focused on good government — told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that “federal leaders, as stewards of public funds, have an obligation to leverage cutting-edge technology to address our collective problems.” “The federal government can and should take concrete steps to enhance the technical capacity of its workforce to fully take advantage of all the possibilities AI has to offer,” Stier added. “The civil service needs to evolve, but it cannot be replaced by AI.” Those more critical of AI have cautioned about its potential to cause harm or automate bias at scale, a point especially relevant as the Trump administration has targeted so-called “woke” AI. Critics say that cracking down on AI tools deemed to be too woke could chill both free speech and AI-focused risk management in government agencies. There’s also questions about the reliability of the technology — generative AI models can produce plausible-seeming but ultimately false outputs called hallucinations — and the fact that many agencies have lost staff that would presumably be called upon to implement new AI solutions. “It's very early days for the use of AI in government services. But what we do know is that the approaches that work well are those where the employees drive the process of integration in a bottom up and grounded way,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign at Brown University who did a stint in the Biden administration. “What doesn't work is firing government workers who have expertise and then trying to use AI to replace their years of knowledge and experience,” Venkatasubramanian said. “And what certainly doesn't work is forcing the remaining workers to be constrained to use only AI tools that conform to Administration speech requirements. Fast is not synonymous with better, and in fact is often the opposite of it.” As for the data to power AI, the Trump administration is already pushing agencies to more easily share data, and its Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of many headlines and lawsuits over its hoovering up of government data. In the spring, Wired and CNN both reported that DOGE is building a “master database” with data from different agencies to track undocumented immigrants. The New York Times also reported on the expanded use of Palantir across the federal government. House Democrats also issued a whistleblower-informed report in April alleging that DOGE was building a cross-agency database of sensitive information from the IRS, SSA and other agencies. Barbaccia maintained that he doesn’t know of such an effort. “I can’t find it for the life of me,” he said. “I have no insight into any sort of master database going on. I asked agencies at IRS and SSA. They don't have anything they're building outside of their internal data. I've asked the vendors who are in the news, too. They're not tracking what the news is about.” “I think it’s people misunderstanding what different vendors do,” he said.

Title: Who Killed the Narrative Podcast?
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/narrative-podcasts-gone-serial-over-my-dead-body-1235409945/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:51:05Z

By Eric Benson “I have a hook for your story,” a podcast producer told me as soon as I called her up earlier this summer. “Pineapple Street announced it’s going out of business today.” I’d already been reporting on the collapse of the narrative podcast industry for several weeks, talking with executives and editors and producers. Everyone had pretty much the same thing to say: things were looking grim. But this news felt personal. I’d hosted and written two shows for Pineapple Street Studios. I had several close collaborators who were still on staff. Even when I was just a fan of podcasts, I knew the name Pineapple Street — it was a pioneering production company and industry leader. They’d made the mega-hit Missing Richard Simmons in 2017, then spent almost a decade churning out award-winning narrative shows like The Catch and Kill Podcast, Ghost Story, and Hysterical. A few years ago, Pineapple Street going out of business would have shocked me. But when I heard about its demise on that Thursday afternoon in June, it felt sad but inevitable. If you haven’t been paying close attention, the idea that a segment of the podcast industry is existentially imperiled may seem counterintuitive. More people than ever are listening to podcasts and talking about podcasts and thinking about starting their own podcasts. Politicians trying to win elections are clamoring to go on podcasts. (When they lose, it is blamed, in part, on not going on the right podcasts.) A recent report from Edison Research estimates that 55 percent of Americans over the age of 12 consumed a podcast in the last month, an all-time high. But the podcasts that are thriving are talk shows — increasingly celebrity-driven talk shows — that are cheap to make, can easily be turned into streaming YouTube videos, and command big ad dollars. Narrative podcasts — the multi-episode, investigative journalism–fueled shows that boomed after the release of Serial in October 2014 — have followed an inverse trajectory. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century For years, narrative podcasts were the buzziest segment of the industry. They were what many listeners thought of when they heard the word “podcast.” Many of these shows, following the lead of Serial, were true crime, while others, like Slow Burn, took a similar investigative approach to politics and history. But regardless of genre, most narrative shows shared a style — they were told through the perspective of a single reporter-host, who not only guided a listener through a story but invited them along on the reporting journey. Now, these shows seem increasingly like an artifact of history. Layoffs have hit nearly every organization that makes this kind of audio, from corporate behemoths like Spotify to successful start-ups like Pushkin Industries to the public-radio godfather of it all, This American Life. In early August, Amazon announced it was dismantling Wondery, one of the biggest and most commercially successful studios in the business, which had made its name on shows like Dr. Death and The Shrink Next Door. Amazon had acquired Wondery less than five years ago for $300 million. Now, the company was being broken up into parts and a reported 110 staffers were laid off. “It feels like podcasts speed-ran the development of an industry to the decline of an industry,” the journalist and podcast host Evan Ratliff told me. “It went from people were making absolutely no money, to people were making fortunes big enough where they’d never have to work again, to ‘There’s not a budget for that’ in less than 10 years.” Now, even those reduced budgets have vanished. The fall of the industry has been so vertiginous that it’s been hard to fully comprehend its decline. But in many ways, this collapse was baked into its spectacular rise, when a flood of dumb money, pollyannaish entrepreneurs, and hungry journalists rushed to build an industry that would soon turn into a house of cards. YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MAKING podcasts, I thought I was already too late to get in on the craze. This was the mid-2010s, and after Serial, it felt like every other month brought another expertly crafted narrative series. There was the first season of In the Dark, and S-Town, and Missing Richard Simmons—podcasts that not only got millions of listeners but were covered in the mainstream media as events. They got picked over, debated on social media. They felt like they mattered. So when my friend Matthew Shaer asked me if I might be interested in making a podcast with him in the spring 2017, I leapt at the opportunity. Related Content 'The Yogurt Shop Murders' Director on the 'Cursed' Story That Haunts Austin 30 Years Later Four Things We Learned From Netflix’s New Son of Sam Docuseries They Were Accused of a Brutal Murder. Can She Prove Their Innocence? Margo Price Keeps the ‘Bastards’ at Bay on Rolling Stone's New Podcast ‘Nashville Now’ Matt told me he’d happened upon a story about a Florida State University law professor named Dan Markel who had been shot to death outside his home in Tallahassee in 2014. Two alleged hitmen had been charged in the case, but authorities believed the masterminds behind the murder were family members of Markel’s ex-wife. Matt had tried to pitch it xas a magazine story, but he’d struck out, which turned out to be a lucky break. The Markel case was convoluted, had tons of backstory, and there was hours of archival audio from police wiretaps and stings. In other words, it was perfect for a podcast. Matt and I spent months developing the idea, then we pitched it to Wondery, which was fresh off its first big hit, Dirty John. Within a couple weeks, we’d signed a contract to make a six-episode show. We wanted to call it Tallahassee. Wondery’s CEO Hernan Lopez, a shrewd former television executive, opted instead for the crass but grabby Over My Dead Body. He said he liked titles that were phrases people actually said. In mid-February 2019, the night before Over My Dead Body was released, Wondery hosted a launch party at the Ace Hotel in New York. They billed it as the “exclusive world premiere of 2019’s next blockbuster.” Lopez, Wondery’s CEO served as master of ceremonies, insisting that all the attendees blindfold themselves while listening to the first episode. Afterward, Matt and I went to dinner with Marshall Lewy, Wondery’s chief content officer, who told us about his attempt to court an Oscar-nominated screenwriter to adapt Over My Dead Body. That particular screenwriter had declined, but it hardly mattered. The show hit number one on the Apple podcast charts and stayed there for weeks. That summer, the actress and director Elizabeth Banks optioned the show for development. In 2019, the movie and TV industry just couldn’t resist a good podcast. “My friends in Hollywood would be like, ‘People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about graphic novels or comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies,’” Jenna Weiss-Berman, the co-founder of Pineapple Street, tells me. “Then everyone was like, cool, this is going to be an amazing business.” “People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies” In truth, narrative podcasts had always been a strange business. Requiring months (and sometimes years) of reporting and an exhaustive writing and editing process, they were expensive to produce and struggled to attract enough advertising to pay for their budgets. (Weekly chat shows, with their consistent audiences and parasocial relationships between host and listener, were always a safer bet.) The Hollywood money could help close the gap, and when a show struck big like Wondery’s The Shrink Next Door — which had a purchase price of $1.25 million and numerous associated bonus fees — narrative podcasts could turn a tidy profit. But podcasting still seemed like a relatively modest offshoot of magazines and public radio. Then Big Tech changed the math entirely. A week before the Over My Dead Body launch party, Spotify announced that it was acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet for a reported $230 million. Spotify had been looking to reduce its dependency on record labels while also becoming a one-stop shop audio company, and Gimlet — which made highly produced shows — was a key plank in that strategy. To most people in the industry, Spotify buying Gimlet made sense, but Spotify buying Gimlet for $230 million seemed, to quote one longtime producer, “totally insane.” (As Brian Reed, the host of S-Town, noted to me, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a similar sum in 2013. ”A five-year-old podcast company being valued at the same amount as one of the biggest legacy media brands ever — that, to me, encapsulates the bubble we were in,” Reed says.) Gimlet had routinely struggled with profitability. Now, their founders and investors had cashed out for a quarter-billion dollars. ”It was like Spotify dropped a wallet in the street and Gimlet picked it up — it could’ve been any of us,” one former podcast executive told me. It wasn’t long before other wallets started dropping. In August 2019, Pineapple Street, a considerably smaller company than Gimlet, sold to Entercom (later rebranded Audacy) for $18 million. In July 2020, the New York Times bought Serial Productions for a reported $25 million. That December, Amazon announced its $300 million bet on Wondery. These companies weren’t buying narrative podcast shops because they thought narrative podcasts were a can’t-miss business. They saw them as part of their grand corporate maneuverings. One former Pineapple Street staffer tells me an Entercom executive had said during the acquisition, “We don’t need you to make money. We want you to make shows we can brag about.” Soon, Sony, Apple TV+, and Amazon were aggressively commissioning narrative podcasts from independent producers, too. New companies like Campside Media (co-founded by my Over My Dead Body reporting partner Matthew Shaer) cropped up to feed the beast, churning out narrative series for the big players while hoping they might follow Pineapple Street and Serial Productions and get acquired for a spectacular fee. As money swelled the ranks of the industry, it also gave it a sense of staying power. Narrative podcasts couldn’t be written off as a fad. They were a new medium, the savior of longform storytelling. A day after Spotify acquired Gimlet, the National Magazine Awards unveiled the finalists for their first-ever podcasting prize. Later that year, the Pulitzer Prizes announced they were adding an “audio reporting” category. Podcast hosts like Serial‘s Sarah Koenig and S-Town’s Brian Reed were going on late-night shows. Hulu was launching its Emmy-winning comedy series about true-crime podcasters, Only Murders in the Building. Big-time print journalists like The New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe were jumping into the world of narrative podcasts and loving it. Keefe tells me that not only was making his show, Wind of Change, one of the “happiest, most creatively fulfilling experiences” of his career, but he saw audiences respond to it in a lasting way. “On book tour, there are always people who show up, having read none of my books, and want to talk about Wind of Change,” Keefe says. I was feeling optimistic too. Over My Dead Body had been just the beginning for me. I made a campaign-trail podcast for Texas Monthly called Underdog: Beto v. Cruz; I was reporting and writing the investigative true-crime series Suspect and executive producing a story of drug-smuggling and police corruption called Witnessed: Borderlands. Then there was my show Project Unabom, about the 18-year manhunt to find Ted Kaczynski, which I’d gotten greenlit off a pitch that was barely a paragraph long. I was busier than I’d ever been, and I was already discussing new projects that would keep me occupied for the next 18 months. At the time, I was a staff writer for Texas Monthly, which had once seemed like a dream job. But in December 2020, I quit. I wanted to write and produce podcasts full time. I had caught the bug. I wasn’t the only one. IN THE SUMMER OF 2016, Connie Walker was looking for a new way to tell stories. She was a television reporter at the CBC News in Toronto, where she specialized in covering indigenous issues. She had a big audience, but she also found that she was frustrated by the quick-hit nature of TV news. Walker is Cree and grew up in the Okanese First Nation in rural Saskatchewan, and she wanted to bring history and context into her stories. Almost always, she had to leave that on the cutting room floor. Podcasts had been a revelation. She’d gotten hooked on Serial and was inspired by its immersive approach to storytelling. So she pitched her bosses on a podcast about the unsolved 1989 murder of Canadian woman from the Gitxsan nation. Walker’s bosses were television people. They’d never overseen a podcast before, but they cautiously agreed. She had a tight deadline and a tiny team, but plenty of editorial freedom to tell the story of an indigenous community in the way she wanted. “I think for a long time there was just this feeling that our stories weren’t important or that Canadians wouldn’t care,” Walker tells me. “And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams? debuted that fall, and it quickly found an audience. Walker tracked the ins and outs of the case, but she was after something larger: “We started this story looking for answers about Alberta Williams’ unsolved murder, but the deeper we got into the story the more I thought about the bigger questions,” Walker says at the beginning of the fourth episode. “Why are there over 1,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada? My hope in telling Alberta’s story is to begin to connect the dots.” “For a long time there was this feeling that our stories weren’t important. And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Within a couple months of the show’s release, Walker was connecting even more dots, reporting a new season that tracked her search for a long-ago missing Cree girl named Cleopatra Semaganis Nicotine. But midway through production, Walker’s manager told her that it would be her last podcast. “She was like, ‘This takes too long. It’s too expensive. This is it,’” Walker says. And I was like, ‘it hasn’t even come out yet.’ And she said, ‘management doesn’t support it.’ Missing & Murdered: Finding Cleo was a breakout hit, but the CBC stuck to its decision. Walker went back to making television, but soon she was looking for a new employer. In the summer of 2019, she was invited to meet with a few executives at Gimlet, which had just been acquired by Spotify. As soon as she walked into their Brooklyn offices, she was wide-eyed. The CBC offices looked like what you’d expect from a public broadcaster — drab carpeting, dated computers, refrigerators full of sad office lunch. Gimlet’s offices were all start-up pizzazz — designer furniture, gleaming cutting-edge equipment, break rooms stocked with free sparkling water and a cornucopia of snacks. Even better, Gimlet offered Walker its full editorial backing. “I was begging at the CBC, like ‘Please let me,’ and with Gimlet it was like, ‘What can we do to support you and your vision of the podcast?” Walker says. “It really was like a dream come true.” Walker’s Gimlet show, Stolen, continued the work she’d started with Missing & Murdered. In the first season, she investigated the recent disappearance of a young mother named Jermain Charlo, but in the second season, Walker broke the mold, focusing on a mystery involving her own father, Howard Cameron, and the abuse he and his peers suffered at the St. Michael’s Residential School, which had been established as part of a government policy of forced assimilation. It was a dark, personal story, and Gimlet gave Walker the time and the team to pursue the most ambitious work of her career. Gimlet’s largesse was worth it. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s won nearly every award for which it was nominated, including the Peabody and the Pulitzer. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was one of the strongest cases imaginable for the existence of narrative podcasts. The resources at Gimlet had allowed a reporter to investigate a deeply personal story, then broaden the scope until she’d crafted a furious indictment of institutional abuse and racism. Just as importantly, the behind-the-scenes transparency of the medium had taken what could have been a dry exercise in accountability journalism and injected it with the sizzle and suspense of a police procedural. And the voices of the survivors themselves gave it an intimacy and force that would have been almost impossible in another medium. But when Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was winning the biggest awards in audio journalism, Walker’s triumph was tempered by the fact that Gimlet itself was a husk of its former self. The problems had burst into public view two years earlier with accusations that one of Gimlet’s flagship shows, Reply All, had created a hostile work environment for non-white staffers. That had led to a reckoning inside the company and, within a little over a year, the end of Reply All. Other longtime Gimlet shows, which were siloed as “Spotify exclusives” and unavailable on other platforms, started bleeding their audiences. New shows had trouble gaining traction. In October 2022, Spotify, under pressure from investors to reduce costs, began culling its original podcast offerings, cancelling several Gimlet shows and laying off dozens of staffers. By the end of that year, Gimlet’s managing director, Lydia Polgren, and its co-founders, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber, had all departed the company. Then in June 2023, less than a month after Walker’s Pulitzer and Peabody wins, Spotify shut down Gimlet and put its few remaining shows under the mantle of Spotify Studios. In just four years, Spotify had turned $230 million into zero dollars. Spotify spared Stolen for a few months, but that December, it too was cancelled. The news wasn’t a surprise to Walker. “I feel like we knew kind of before we knew,” she says. She and her team were allowed to stay on and finish their third season, Stolen: Trouble in Sweetwater, but when its final episode was released in April 2024, they were all out of work. In some ways, this was familiar terrain for Walker, echoing her experience with the CBC. But the podcast industry was in a vastly different place in the summer of 2024 than it had been in the summer of 2019. Gone were the days when studios like Gimlet were flush with cash and hungry to buy up new talent. When Spotify cancelled Stolen and another former Gimlet show, Heavyweight, a company spokesperson said they would “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.” But there was nowhere to go next for Stolen. When Walker reached out to podcast studios and media companies, they didn’t try to woo her at their venture capital-funded offices. She couldn’t get anyone to make her an offer at all. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s had felt like undeniable proof of what she’d been trying to convince people of for her entire career — “that these stories are important, that there’s an audience, and that they can have an impact.” But that moment had faded. Two months after Spotify cancelled Stolen, the company signed a new $250 million deal with Joe Rogan. THE NARRATIVE PODCAST INDUSTRY HAD always been an awkward mash-up of characters — public-radio true believers, Hollywood producers, magazine refugees, and eventually tech executives — and it had always been a little unclear what the goal of making these shows really was. Were they entertainment or journalism? Should their success be measured in awards and social impact, or by their ability to turn a buck? Did these podcasts exist principally for their listening audiences, or were they really, when you got down to it, just proof of concept for film and television development? The different segments of the industry always had different answers to these questions, but for a time, while the money was flowing, it felt like podcasts could be everything to everyone. The precious journalists could strive for their Pulitzers, and the wannabe Ari Golds could have their Hollywood deals. The answer to every binary choice was “yes.” But then the money started to go away. The tech and media giants that had funded the podcast boom had learned that narrative journalism was hard to scale. In 2019, it might have been enough for them to make shows that “we can brag about,” but a few years later, as recession fears grew, losing money on prestige programming no longer seemed like a good idea. “Podcasting has been a drag on the gross margin side,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in January 2023, “Some shows worked, some didn’t perform as we expected. And that is a sign of maturing. You go for growth first and then you seek efficiency.” As 2023 went on, Ek and his competitors tacked hard toward efficiency. “Places that were buying these shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000?’” Weiss-Berman, the Pineapple Street co-founder, told me. “Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” For years, the industry had been building itself up on the premise that the demand would only grow for prestige TV-like narrative shows and budgets would remain robust. When the big tech companies cut back, the first solution for the production companies that depended on them was mass layoffs. The second was closing up shop entirely. For anyone making a living in podcasting, the future started to look like finding a new line of work. “Places that were buying shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000? Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” At the beginning of this year, that’s how it was looking to me. I’d spent much of the previous two years writing and producing two shows that had both been killed by their commissioning companies. They weren’t bad. I’m pretty sure they were good. But they didn’t sound exactly like something that had come before, which meant they weren’t easily slotted into a pre-existing feed. By then, a conservatism had set in. The industry of “yes” was now beginning to resemble the worst of Hollywood. Creative executives, under pressure to churn out hits, were increasingly micromanaging the process, engaging in what one award-winning host described to me as a “firing line approach to editing.” In February, I finished up a show that actually got released, the Wondery podcast Death County, PA, which had showcased the high-impact prison reporting of the journalist Joshua Vaughn. Then, for the first time since 2018, I faced a world in which I had no offers for new podcast work. But I don’t know if I’m done with podcasts, even if a certain kind of corporate-backed, lavishly budgeted narrative show appears to be extinct. My favorite podcast from the last 12 months is called Shell Game, and in many ways it’s a playbook for what might come next. Hosted and reported by Evan Ratliff, a longtime tech journalist and one of the hosts of the Longform podcast, Shell Game is an experimental series about artificial intelligence, and in many ways, it’s a rejection of the compromises that had become baked into making shows for Big Podcast. “I knew it was going to weird,” Ratliff says. “And I wanted to be as weird as possible. I didn’t want to be forced into analytic conclusions about AI, the kind of places you get pushed by people who are trying to sell your show.” Of course, by the spring of 2024, when Ratliff started making Shell Game, he probably wouldn’t have found anyone to fund it anyway. But that was fine. Ratliff figured he could do it cheaply with a small team. He hired Sophie Bridges, a producer he’d worked with previously, and leaned on the expertise of his wife, Samantha Henig, who had founded and led the audio division of the New York Times. The tiny team didn’t diminish the quality of the show. And part of what’s so wonderful about Shell Game is it’s a story that could only exist as a podcast. Ratliff created an AI voice clone of himself and set it loose in the world. In the show, we hear AI Evan interact on the phone, often hilariously, with a series of interlocutors, starting with customer service representatives and scammers and building to two sessions with an unwitting human therapist via the online platform Better Help. Shell Game made several best-of-the-year lists, and Ratliff says it broke even. (The revenue came almost entirely from subscriptions to an affiliated Substack.) Then, it won a $50,000 prize from the Independent Media Initiative, which made it profitable. But breaking even is a tough business model, and prize money isn’t something you can count on. For Season Two of Shell Game, Ratliff is collaborating with the independent podcast studio Kaleidoscope, which has given him more a financial cushion while still allowing him to make the show he wants to make. “They’re into telling a story that sounds as far from any formula as possible and helping us try to do that,” Ratliff said. That’s how the future might look: smaller, more independent, more experimental, but also with fewer shows being made and basically no hope of striking rich. But that future is hard to see from the present. At the moment, the narrative podcasts that are making it to the top of the Apple charts are tabloid-y true-crime, often affiliated with TV shows like Dateline and 20/20. Pineapple Street has vanished, Wondery has been gutted, and many of the surviving production companies are trying desperately to pivot to weekly chat shows. Nearly every producer and editor I worked with in podcasting — across seven years and 12 shows — is struggling to find work. Some are piecing together freelance gigs doing field reporting for news-radio outlets. A few are staffing chat shows. One talented producer I know is now working for a fly-fishing magazine. Another started a successful food Substack. An entire generation of journalists who started in podcasting are leaving and are unlikely to return. And many of the most respected and experienced producers, editors, and reporters in the industry are out in the cold too. Connie Walker is one of them. When I spoke to Walker in late June, she was about to start a new job as a journalism professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. There, she’d be continuing the work she began in Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s, collecting the testimony of residential school survivors and building out an archive of the abuses that took place. That work is certainly worthwhile, but when we spoke, Walker was open about the fact that her “new dream” was to turn that work into another podcast. In retrospect, the boom years of narrative podcasting were always a kind of dream. When she went to Gimlet, Connie Walker felt like she’d won the lottery. Sometimes I felt like I had, too. Now, that era is definitively over. A few people got rich. Many more came out the other side with no job, and if they were lucky, a few months severance. Whatever comes next will be built up in the shadow of that history — that it all looked so good and that so many of us bought into the mirage. We want to hear it.

Good morning. Many of their colleagues were downsizing and preparing for their "empty nest" years. But one couple in their mid-40s moved in the opposite direction: they bought a bigger house. They don't always use the space, the cleaning is endless, and the bills are higher. A decade later, they're convinced they made the right decision. In today's big story, we all face an AI-supercharged job market. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, while hiring managers revealed how they're adapting to identify real talent. What's on deck: Markets: Are you struggling as a day trader? This psychologist might know why. Tech: It's not just Big Tech that's clamoring after AI engineers. Everyone wants to date them. Business: Like their customers, millennial-coded brands are facing the cold, hard reality of aging. But first, hand-delivered is hard to ignore. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Perhaps you did everything right. You spent hours researching the company. Hours more rewriting your résumé. The cover letter? Polished, professional, and personal. You click "submit." And wait. The days spin into weeks. The inbox never dings. You're not alone. White-collar hiring has slowed, layoffs feel de rigueur, and many who do have jobs are clinging onto them — whether they're happy or not. "My dream job might exist," a frustrated Gen Z job seeker told BI. "But I'm one of 400 people applying for it." The issue cuts both ways. For hiring managers, their dream employee might also exist. But amid a crowd of AI-generated applications, they may never find them. BI spoke with people on either side of the hiring divide. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, and employers revealed their strategies for spotting real talent. They're going old school. Job seekers are getting creative, with some finding success going back to basics: handing in a paper résumé in person. Businesses are adapting, too. With AI tools now helping with résumés, cover letters, and even live interviews, measuring a candidate's suitability for a role can be challenging. Is this the person we want to hire — or just the AI that coached them? Victoria Thomas, the chief business officer of a Porsche customization and racing company, said AI-crafted résumés can make candidates seem more qualified than they really are. To combat this, her team flies candidates to their Wisconsin office for in-person interviews and tryouts. The workplace is changing — and so are the rules for job searching. BI has tapped HR managers, recruiters, career coaches, and executives for their best advice on everything from crafting a standout résumé to networking your way to a final offer. So, before you send off that job application, you can find everything you need to gain an edge here. 1. Meet the 16-year-old prodigy at Citadel Securities. Kairan Quazi, a quant developer at the New York trading giant, caught the world's attention when he landed a job at SpaceX at age 14. He told BI why he switched from Big Tech to quant finance. 2. What makes (and breaks) a day trader? Andrew Menaker, a psychologist who coaches traders on and off Wall Street, has an answer. He said ego and aggression are traits that lead traders astray, and shared tips for those trying to get in on the trade. 3. Where to invest if the market goes south. If you're holding cash right now, it's a good idea to have a strategy for buying the dip in case a bear market hits. Two rules of thumb: Don't enter the market all at once, and don't panic. Here's where experts suggest investing. 1. In Silicon Valley, the ladies want a tech nerd. Professional matchmakers in the Bay Area — whose fees range from $5,900 to $500,000 — told BI more women are looking for AI engineers, thanks to their high salaries and job stability. It's not clear how long interest will last, but for now, the AI boom is making nerds sexy. 2. The startup turning Elon Musk's DOGE-fueled chaos into cash. Legalist, a startup founded by one of Peter Thiel's fellows, provides gap financing for vendors awaiting payouts from the federal government. Here's how they cashed in on the havoc DOGE wrecked. 3. How these Gen Zers beat the odds to score roles in tech. The industry is hemorrhaging entry-level jobs thanks to AI and corporate cost-cutting. Young workers told BI how they scored roles after casting a wide net or networking around the clock. 1. Millennial brands hit middle age. Glossier is at Sephora. Mideas are having holes drilled in them. What once seemed like an industry adjustment toward direct, values-centered relationships with consumers has been exposed as a marketing ploy — and today, these brands are either dying or becoming boring companies, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. 2. Spotify's ad business is laggy. Advertising made up 11% of its business in June, a far cry from its 20% target. "We have simply been moving too slowly," CEO Daniel Ek said on the company's latest earnings call. Industry insiders said poor customer service and low podcast ad rates were also factors. 3. The AT&T CEO's blunt memo is a test case for leaders. Since BI was the first to report on AT&T CEO John Stankey's viral memo to managers, hundreds of readers, including leaders, have weighed in. BI spoke to current and former CEOs for their thoughts on the memo. Three tips for employees to manage their wellbeing in a challenging job environment, from EY's Chief Wellbeing Officer.

Oracle has cut over 300 roles in the US When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings have confirmed Oracle has laid off over 300 workers in Washington and California. The redundancies consist of 143 workers in Redwood City, California and a further 161 in Seattle, Washington, however further layoffs could also be taking place that are not covered by WARN filings. A worker familiar with the matter told The Register the figures sound low, suggesting remote workers might not be accounted for – a way of obscuring the scale of layoffs that Microsoft has also been accused of. "It feels like that happened here too, the reported numbers don't quite match up with what my network is saying," the worker said. "My estimate would be low thousands worldwide... Supposedly this is just the start, too," they added. Compared with other giants in this space, Oracle's reaction to economic uncertainties has been pretty reserved. Around 200 workers left in 2022, with some more leaving in separate sittings since then. Compared with the tens of thousands who have lost their jobs at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Oracle workers have therefore been pretty safe. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Looking ahead, The Register's source suggests thousands could lose their jobs worldwide with offices being closed and large cuts in India (around 10% of its local workforce). Artificial intelligence has been blamed for ongoing tech layoffs, but instead of AI taking human jobs, companies are having to allocate more capital towards AI data center expansions, effectively cutting their staffing budgets. In June, Oracle confirmed a revenue increase for fiscal 2025 of 8%. "Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26," CEO Safra Catz noted. TechRadar Pro has asked Oracle to share further context about its recent layoffs. Any update will be posted here.

Title: Pop culture and politics are intertwined in the age of Trump. Just look at the Paramount-Skydance merger

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. My first job in the U.S. included covering Martha Stewart and World Wrestling Entertainment during the dot-com boom. Stewart was a multimedia influencer and doyenne of domesticity; Vince and Linda McMahon had transformed wrestling from a traveling circus of showmen and athletes into a superstar-studded global entertainment phenomenon. Today’s “trad wife” phenomenon or “manosphere” populated by the likes of Joe Rogan are not without precedent. Pop culture always reflects and responds to trends in the political sphere, and vice versa. What’s unusual, perhaps, is the degree to which the two worlds have become intertwined. It helps that Trump comes from that world, having spent several years in reality TV and most of his adult life as a media celebrity. Along with installing himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, President Trump personally picked this year’s list of honorees, which includes Kiss and Sylvester Stallone, and will host what he promises to be an ‘anti-woke’ ceremony. Few CEOs are more attuned to the political winds in Hollywood right now than David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount following Skydance Media’s merger with Paramount Global earlier this month. To get the deal done, Skydance agreed to “address bias and restore fact-based reporting,” according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and appoint an ombudsman to address any concerns about bias. Paramount had also reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris prior to the deal getting done. In one of his first moves as head of the combined Paramount, Ellison last week announced a $7.7 billion agreement to air Ultimate Fighting Championship events over the next seven years. That’s no doubt a smart business decision and certainly not lost on Ellison that UFC is a Trump-friendly form of entertainment, as well as a “global sports powerhouse.” UFC CEO Dana White said Ellison negotiated an “all-or-nothing” deal. White is close to Trump, who recently said he’d love to stage a UFC match on the White House lawn. (White also recently joined Meta’s board, too.) Ellison, meanwhile, also struck a multi-year partnership with Taylor Sheridan, the creative mind behind “Yellowstone” and various spinoffs that are popular with conservative audiences. To grow beyond the $30+ billion it made last year, Paramount will need to appeal to a wide and varied demographic. While its cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” sparked accusations of pro-Trump bias, Paramount’s recent $1.5 billion streaming deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone suggests that Ellison understands the power of polarizing entertainment on both sides of the house.

A decade of tech-fueled advice led to a 133 percent surge in U.S. computer science majors, now struggling in a job market flooded with AI tools. Rising AI adoption reduces demand for junior developers; some graduates apply to thousands of jobs but find no offers. 7.5 percent unemployment for CS engineers â more than double the rate for art history or biology graduates. Companies like Microsoft now funnel resources into A.I. education amid decreased hiring. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs.

Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. The "learn to code" mantra once promised a golden ticket to six-figure salaries in tech, but a wave of unemployment and disillusionment has replaced that optimism. Recent graduates with computer science degrees, enticed by corporate campaigns and federal initiatives, now confront a market where entry-level roles are shrinking due to AI tools and layoffs, leaving some to seek work at fast-food chains. The National Science Foundation reports that over 170,000 U.S. undergraduates majored in computer science in 2024 â more than double the 2014 total. Yet, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis reveals that unemployment among CS engineering graduates reached 7.5 percent in 2025, far exceeding rates for non-tech majors. Manasi Mishra, a 21-year-old Purdue graduate, epitomizes the shift. Despite excelling academically, she joked in a TikTok video that her only tech interview offer came from Chipotle, the burrito chain. âTech promised magic, but reality is bitter,â Mishra said, now pivoting to a sales role after months of job rejections. AI tools pinch entry-level opportunities The rise of AI coding platforms like GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit has catalyzed a seismic shift in tech hiring. These tools can auto-generate code, debug workflows and reduce the need for junior developers. San Francisco billboards now tout A.I. software that âdebugs faster than humans,â underscoring the new reality. âThereâs a doom loop,â said Matthew Martin, an economist with Oxford Economics. âEntry-level roles â precisely where graduates seek their first jobs â are the most vulnerable to automation.â Zach Taylor, an Oregon State graduate, applied to 5,762 tech jobs since spring 2023, earning 13 interviews but no offers. âItâs demoralizing,â Taylor admitted. Now relying on unemployment benefits, heâs returned to his parentsâ home, building side projects to stay relevant. Even government roles, once seen as a safety net, face hurdles. Jamie Spoeri, a Georgetown graduate, applied to 200 jobs after a National Science Foundation internship yet encountered federal hiring freezes and A.I.-filtered rÃ©sumÃ©s. âAI isnât just replacing code â itâs replacing humans in the hiring process,â said data scientist Audrey Roller, who faced instant algorithmic rejection. Corporate and government responses: AI training vs. industry realities Leaders are recalibrating education strategies. $4 billion from Microsoft now funds AI-centric training, while the Biden administrationâs âAI action planâ repurposes federal dollars to steer students toward machine learning roles. However, critics argue this ignores structural issues like outsourcing and the saturation of A.I. tools. Tracy Camp, director of the Computing Research Association, noted that many universities still lack cutting-edge AI curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for rapid industry shifts. âSchools are playing catch-up,â she said. Meanwhile, major layoffs at Amazon, Microsoft and Meta â triggered by economic uncertainty and automationÂ â are compounding the crisis. According to Voronoi data, U.S. software developer job postings peaked in early 2022 before plummeting 33 percent by mid-2025. Student stories: From code to complacency? Despite the setbacks, some graduates are adapting. Mishra, now in sales, credits her TikTok beauty gig with broadening her career vision. âI realized I love tech marketing, not coding,â she said. Others, like Spoeri, stay hopeful. âAI will create new niches,â she argued, but cautioned: âWeâre in a transition phase.â The psychological toll is acute. Researchers like Jeff Forbes, a former NSF official, warn of disillusionment. âLast yearâs grads were fighting for offers. Now, many canât find any job,â Forbes said. A new era of tech work or a system in crisis? The collapse of the âcoding boomâ narrative reflects a deeper disconnect between education and industry evolution. While AI tools offer efficiency gains, theyâve left a generation of tech graduates â many of whom followed corporate and government advice â struggling to justify their degrees. The solution may lie in blended skills: combining technical expertise with creativity, sales, or policy. As Mishraâs pivot shows, adaptability remains critical. Yet, resolving systemic issues â from outsourcing to uneven A.I. training â will require collaboration between academia, tech firms and policymakers to align workforce preparedness with market realities. For now, the once-golden age of computer science has entered a period of reckoning.
