All the news from The Game Awards 2024 in one place, reported as it happened. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Like the last several years before it, 2024 has been a year chock-full of exciting game releases and innovative new hits. Now that it's drawing to a close, it's time to commemorate all of those great new titles with The Game Awards 2024. Geoff Keighley once again hosted the annual awards show in Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, and this year's iteration is particularly celebratory since it was the event's 10th anniversary. The gala kicked off on Thursday, December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. Once the show began, the winners of all 30 awards were announced over the course of the next three hours, with trailers, game reveals, and world premieres that showed off what's next in gaming interspersed between these announcements. The team here at Windows Central watched and reported on the event as it unfolded, and you'll find live coverage of every winner and reveal right here (award winners are highlighted in bold below). Hello everyone, and welcome to our live coverage of The Game Awards 2024! The show may still be a day away, but there's already quite a few things to talk about ahead of its scheduled start time. There have been several teases of what to expect from the presentation from The Game Awards and its partners, all of which I'll be covering here shortly. There's quite a bit of stiff competition in this year's nominations, and there's some noteworthy controversy too; many are frustrated with the inclusion of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree in the running, for example, because it's ultimately still a DLC expansion even if it is the size of a standalone game. As usual, there are also lots of fans who feel their favorite game got snubbed from Game of the Year nominations or other categories (that's me with Helldivers 2, 100%). Still, I'm hoping that it'll be a great event, even if I still have a sour taste in my mouth from how The Game Awards 2023 let down developers and viewers alike by being more about advertisements and trailers than actually celebrating that year's best and brightest titles. Fingers crossed! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 began on December 12, with the show being streamed live at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. You can use the embedded YouTube livestream link above to watch the full three-hour presentation. The YouTube stream we embedded above is one way to watch this year's The Game Awards show, but it's not the only one. The presentation is being broadcast on a variety of different platforms once it begins on December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT, including the following: All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. If you end up having trouble with the stream on one platform, try using one of the others instead and hopefully it'll work better for you. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The vast majority of what's being shown at The Game Awards 2024 will remain a mystery until the show itself kicks off, but that doesn't mean we're going into it completely blind. In fact, the opposite is true, as many developers as well as Geoff Keighley himself have publicly teased several of the games, reveals, trailers, and performances that will appear during the event. These include the following: In addition to these, note that several celebrities and developers will be presenting awards throughout the evening, including Bethesda's Todd Howard, actress Isabela Merced from HBO's The Last of Us Season 2, Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, prolific game voice actor Laura Bailey, Remedy Entertainment's Sam Lake, and none other than Hideo Kojima himself. If we learn anything else about the show before it starts, I'll be sure to post about it here. With that said, I don't expect we will, as it's bound to have plenty of surprises that the showrunners don't want to spoil. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor what im expecting, without hard spoilers:- not a ton from xbox first party studios, pending xbox's own dev direct in q1. - lots of epic multiplat reveals.- other fun stuff.December 9, 2024 That's a direct quote from none other than Windows Central's very own executive editor and Xbox aficionado Jez Corden. Jez posted that to X (Twitter) a few days ago, clearly having heard about some of what's coming in this year's The Game Awards. He went on to say "without hard spoilers" that he's expecting to see impressive multiplatform announcements and "other fun stuff," though believes that Microsoft and Xbox won't have much to show since it has its own Developer_Direct presentation coming in Q1 2025. Sounds like we're in for a good show this year. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor With the actual The Game Awards show now under 24 hours away, I thought it would be fun to share what my personal picks for all of this year's 30 award categories are based on what got nominated and what I've gotten around to playing and watching. Here's my list: I begrudgingly voted for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for many of these categories, as while I absolutely love the expansion and think it's largely better than the nominees it's up against, I don't think DLCs should be included in The Game Awards unless they're in their own separate category. If it was up to me, Helldivers 2 would be in (and win) the Game of the Year running, and Players' Voice wouldn't have three gacha games nominated (players were encouraged to vote for them with promises of free currency in these games by their developers, which is pretty lame). Alas, it is not up to me, so here I sit. Salty. Still, it's nice to see the presentation and performances in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 get the recognition they deserve, and I'm hoping Animal Well wins both indie awards since it's pretty mind-blowing a solo developer made such a deep and create Metroidvania. Shoutout to Manor Lords in Best Sim/Strategy, too; it's another excellent solo-developed project. Also, I really need to set a day or two aside to watch Arcane Season 2. Fallout probably wouldn't be my pick for Best Adaptation if I'd done so already, based on what I've heard. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Before the nominations were announced, I said that we riot if Balatro wasn't nominated for Game of the Year. Now it has been nominated, we riot if it doesn't win Game of the Year. Balatro isn't my most played game of 2024, but it's far and away my pick to claim that coveted prize. I could talk for hours about it, but I won't. The shortened version is that Balatro embodies everything about what makes a great game. At its core, it's pure fun. It doesn't hide behind complicated narratives, flashy graphics, or endless battle passes. It's just a really good, addictive, well-executed game that I can honestly say anyone I've turned to playing it has totally got why I, and so many others, love it so much. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor For Borderlands fans, The Game Awards is Christmas arriving early. We already know Borderlands 4 exists and is scheduled to drop in 2025, but beyond that, not a whole lot. The Game Awards is going to be the first big look at the "most ambitious Borderlands yet" and it's the thing I'm most excited for. Sure, I want Balatro to win GOTY, but I love Borderlands. The franchise that really kicked off the whole looter shooter genre with a bang, and without it, some of my favorite titles may never have come to be. Plus, Borderlands fits so well with my own ridiculous sense of humor, I have no doubts I'm going to enjoy what I see tonight. Bring it on! — Richard Devine, Managing Editor Hey there! Like the rest of the crew, I'm prepping to cover the winter gaming showca-er, the Game Awards 2024, and I'm excited to see what's in store. As we get closer, I figured I'd also share what my picks were from across all the nominations. Bear in mind, I'm following the rules of what got nominated, so no voting for Frostpunk 2 for Game of the Year, even if it should be a contender. Game of the Year: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Game Direction: Astro Bot Best Narrative: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Art Direction: Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Best Score and Music: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Audio Design: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Performance: Melina Juergens as Senua Innovation in Accessibility: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Games for Impact: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Ongoing: Diablo 4 Best Community Support: Helldivers 2 Best Independent Game: Balatro Best Debut Indie Game: Balatro Best Mobile Game: Balatro Best VR/AR: Asgard's Wrath 2 Best Action Game: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Best Action/Adventure: Astro Bot Best RPG: Dragon's Dogma 2 Best Fighting: Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Best Family: Astro Bot Best Sim/Strategy: Age of Mythology: Retold Best Sports/Racing: EA Sports FC 25 Best Multiplayer: Helldivers 2 Best Adaptation: Arcane Most Anticipated Game: Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Again, I emphasize that this is only me choosing based off what was available in each category. My real most anticipated game undoubtedly goes to DOOM: The Dark Ages, as I absolutely cannot wait to see what Bethesda and id Software have cooked up with this Medieval-themed prequel focused on the origin of the Slayer's war on demons. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Since it seems to be all the rage here in the Windows Central live hub for all The Game Awards 2024 news and announcements you need, I've decided to also submit my picks for each category. In my humble (and correct) opinion, here are the winners. I omitted the categories I honestly couldn't care less about, and for the most part stuck with games that I've actually played. If you couldn't tell already, my personal game of the year is absolutely Metaphor: ReFantazio, which I reviewed for Windows Central. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a stunning RPG with an intricate, emotional, and powerful narrative in an incredibly beautiful world. When it comes to RPG gameplay, narrative and game direction, and music. Metaphor: ReFantazio would've run away with art direction, too, but I had to give that to Neva, which I also reviewed and chose as the best indie game of the year. Of course, I also had to give plenty of love to Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, another game I reviewed for Windows Central and one of the most impressive accomplishments in art and narrative design in video games. In particular, Hellblade 2's impactful messaging, unbelievable audio design, and the emotionally devastating performance from Melina Juergens. Finally, justice for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown! Yes, I reviewed that, too. The Lost Crown is still one of my top games of the year, and it deserves at least one award at TGA. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Good morning, everyone! As I type this out, The Game Awards 2024 is now only seven hours away, so it won't be long before we find out which of the nominees in each category are going home with one (or more) of those iconic TGA trophies. We'll also get to see all the new trailers and reveals that developers around the industry have in store for players. Stay tuned with us throughout the day for live coverage before, during, and after the show as we report on and react to all the exciting news. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor See you @thegameawards Expect to be surprised! #TheGameAwardsDecember 12, 2024 Mere hours before the start of TGA 2024, Sloclap — the studio behind last year's excellent kung fu beat 'em up action game Sifu — has confirmed that it will have a presence at the show. It's also telling its fans to "expect to be surprised," which likely means we'll either get a new game announcement or perhaps a Sifu DLC reveal. Either one sounds great to me, so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what Sloclap has in store for players. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor I've been a Call of Duty player for a long time. I'm significantly older than the top players of today, but I've been floating around since the beginning. I took a few years off, though, because the Modern Warfare titles didn't grab me, and I didn't enjoy Vanguard in my limited time with it at all. The latest, Black Ops 6, is up for Best Multiplayer at The Game Awards and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves to win. Not just because it would be a nice catch for the now Microsoft-owned franchise! Ignoring the anticheat woes and the usual community frustrations that you'll always get with a game of this type, Black Ops 6 is a return to form for Call of Duty. The multiplayer is fast and fun, and Omnimovement has made more difference to this than I think a lot would give it credit for. I'm over 230 hours deep already, mostly in multiplayer, which speaks volumes for someone that's avoided almost all PvP games for a few years! Helldivers 2 is also worthy, but I really think Black Ops 6 deserves recognition. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor While plenty of amazing games and talented teams are being recognized during the awards, there's one game that won't be present, and that's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. This excellent adventure title from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks launched just a few days ago, well after the cutoff point for when a game needs to launch in order to be recognized and voted on. I do understand this, really. You have to have a cutoff point with lead time in order to allow the jury to reasonably vote, but it's such a shame that Indy won't be eligible this year, because I firmly believe he'd be a frontrunner for many. After all, this is my game of the year, and I wrote in my review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that "From the manner in which every line is delivered and scene is shot to the smirk on Indy's face when solving a puzzle, it's clear that everyone at MachineGames just gets what makes Indiana Jones so special. This is a game that can sit next to the original trilogy with pride." — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Samuel is absolutely right that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle deserved to be up in The Games Awards' lineup, but it did miss the cutoff date by several weeks. One game that didn't, though, was GSC Game World's highly anticipated survival shooter STALKER 2. The cutoff was originally scheduled for November 22, but it got pushed up with no stated reasoning from The Game Awards; this axed the eligibility of November 20's STALKER 2 at the eleventh hour, which is pretty royally unfair if you ask me. It really should have been up there, as I'd argue it's unquestionably one of this year's best games and an inspiring success story from a beleaguered Ukrainian developer that persisted in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion. Its initial reviews and overall Metacritic scores took a sizable hit from some gnarly performance issues at launch, but GSC quickly patched the game up effectively and have majorly improved the Xbox and Windows PC exclusive. That's allowed its incredibly immersive atmosphere, immensely rewarding open-world exploration, and tense moment-to-moment combat gameplay shine brightly; 84% of its 68,279 user reviews on Steam are positive. In my own review of STALKER 2, I wrote that the shooter "stands tall as one of the most captivating open-world shooters I've ever played, with palpable atmosphere and deeply rewarding exploration that kept me glued to my seat along with addictively intense and dynamic action that kept me on the edge of it." I'd definitely put it (along with Helldivers 2) in Game of the Year in place of Black Myth: Wukong or the Elden Ring DLC if it was eligible, and it should definitely be in the running for Best Action Game and/or Best Action/Adventure, too. The fact it wasn't available as an option to vote for is a real shame. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Storming into the live blog to rant about my own injustice in this year's Game Awards, well not mine, Poncle's. From late 2023 and throughout 2024, Vampire Survivors has received a number of either free or ridiculously cheap updates adding an insane amount of content to the game, from the Among Us and Contra crossovers, to the Darkasso update adding a slew of ridiculously powered new Arcanas. Finishing the year with a boom, we got the Ode to Castlevania DLC in October, which for the tiny price of $3.99 added the biggest map yet, 20 new characters and 40 new weapons. Or did it? No, Poncle hid even MORE content past the end credits, and without spoiling it for those who haven't played yet, you are in for your money's worth.I've put *checks notes* 58 hours into the DLC alone on Steam, and when the Game Awards made such a song and dance about DLC being eligible for awards, I really thought Vampire Survivors would get some well deserved recognition. Alas, it hasn't even been acknowledged in the ongoing game. A travesty.Balatro making it into the Game of the Year category is the only thing keeping me from full incandescent rage, that and good old BAFTA Games have longlisted Vampire Survivors in it's own awards, so fingers crossed Poncle will get the recognition they so deserve elsewhere. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor Balatro is absolutely clearing everying else in the Game of the Year category right now. Don't tell me I'm biased! Earlier this week, Cyberpunk 2077 paid homage to the game with a Balatro-inspired mission as a nod to Jimbo. Now, just over an hour ago, Balatro decided to keep the momentum going with a huge surprise—dropping the brand-new Friends of Jimbo 3 Pack 3 DLC on all platforms. This DLC features crossovers with deep breath Divinity: Original Sin 2, Shovel Knight, Potion Craft, Enter The Gungeon, Cult of the Lamb, Don't Starve, 1000xRESIST, and Warframe. The announcement came via an incredible trailer starring none other than Ben Starr, who plays our favorite Joker to perfection. Starr, who was nominated at last year’s Game Awards for his role in Final Fantasy 16, delivers a great performance in the trailer, which totally will not give me nightmares. With Balatro now celebrating 3.5 million copies sold, it’s no wonder it’s cementing its spot as one of the year’s best games. Honestly, it’s my personal Game of the Year winner—and with this level of content and creativity, it’s a title that’s more than well-deserved. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor This year's The Game Awards celebration is fairly unique, as it happens to be the 10th anniversary of the event that showrunner Geoff Keighley first established in 2014. Therefore, while it's commemorating all the amazing games that have released in 2024, it's also something of a ceremony for The Game Awards' success in the last decade as well. Geoff Keighley, executive producer Kimmie Kim, director Richard Preuss, and production designer LeRoy Bennett have all spoken about this year's show in a new Variety interview, with the team discussing The Game Awards' rise in popularity and production quality over time, its similarities and differences compared to other shows like the Oscars and VMAs, and its focus on celebrating recent games while simultaneously giving fans a sneak peek at the future. Notably, Keighley commented in the interview that some of what players will see goes beyond what's coming next year. "This audience really does want to see the future, so we’ll be focused not just on what’s happening in 2025 in gaming, but I think you’ll see some things that are even further out at the show," he said. Overall, it's an enjoyable read, and one worth checking out while we're waiting for the show to start. Only about three and a half hours to go! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor PRESENTED BY AGGRO CRAB:THE GAME AWARDS BINGO CARD 2024play along with us or just watch the chaos‼️ pic.twitter.com/tkfq2m9geADecember 12, 2024 It's impossible to know exactly what we'll see at The Game Awards, but trying to predict its schedule and then seeing if we're right is always a fun way to enjoy the show. That's the idea with bingo cards, and this one from Aggro Crab — the developer behind this year's excellent underwater Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure — is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of funny references to controversial elements of this year's show (like the presence of Elden Ring's DLC) as well as jokes about its hosts, presenters, and past events (like Snoop Dogg and marijuana, the discussion about developer clothing last year, and Josef Fares' on-stage antics). I need to see Geoff Keighley bring an actual alligator on-stage to present something for Grand Theft Auto VI (set in a satirical version of Florida), but I'm going to be peeved if I have to cross off that "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" square. By the way, Another Crab's Treasure itself is a delightful indie, and if you play games on Xbox or PC, you can check it out with Xbox Game Pass. If you like Soulslikes, I strongly recommend it. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Hey gang, it's that time again. Geoff Keighley is out in force this year for The Game Awards, and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. There are rumors of all shapes and sizes flying around, and I've already posted some expectations on socials, but I want to add here what Xbox and Windows PC gamers can expect from Microsoft and its partners at this year's show. NO SPOILERS, though. From what I'm hearing, there will be at least a couple blockbuster announcements (initially shared by Jason Schrier on KindaFunny). One is a PlayStation exclusive fans should be very excited to see. However, at least one of the other major announcements should indeed represent a full multiplatform release across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It should spark a ton of excitement if true — although I'm not sure whether to expect this particular game to launch in the near term. As for Xbox itself, I expect the vast majority, if not every announcement relevant to Xbox to be a multiplatform affair. But there could be at least a couple of fun announcements, at least one could expand the already packed 2025 Xbox first-party slate. For my full The Game Awards predictions list, head over here. — Jez Corden, Executive Editor While we're all looking forward to the different announcements and awards, including seeing who wins Best Performance, it's extremely important to remember that SAG-AFTRA is still on strike. The union is seeking agreements to prevent abuse of AI, a hot topic across the game and tech industries. These actors are a huge reason why some of the biggest games can succeed, so if you've ever appreciated a performance like Maggie Robertson as Lady Dimitrescu or Troy Baker as Indiana Jones, you should be aware of what the concerns are as the strike continues. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor There are a lot of games nominated for awards this year, with a ton of genre variety throughout the full list. Even the most dedicated gamers likely haven't played all of them as a result — I haven't gotten around to playing half of the Game of the Year nominees, myself — but if you're looking to catch up on what you missed, you'll want to take advantage of these excellent limited-time deals. Amazon, Microsof (Xbox), and Sony (PS5) are all offering special discounts on The Game Awards 2024 nominees on their respective storefronts, along with price cuts on quality gaming accessories like mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, and more. The PlayStation sale is the best one since that sale runs until December 16 (Microsoft's ends after the show), but they're all great, and they allow you to save 75% or more on many of this year's best games. Check them out! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 is now under one hour away from broadcasting live, so now's the time to get some grub or stretch for a while before settling in for the show. I'm going to eat a quick bite myself, but I'll be back soon to provide you with live coverage of the ceremony. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor T-minus 5 minutes away from the start of The Game Awards! Enjoy the show if you're watching live, and thanks for sticking with us as we report on all the cool stuff we're about to see. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 has kicked off with the announcement of Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a new platformer in the legendary series headed your way in summer 2025. Hope you like packing (and unpacking). A cozy game about moving called One Move Away is coming in 2025, and it looks very relaxing to play! Last year's incredibly popular indie title Dave the Diver has an "In the Jungle" expansion coming in late 2025, so be ready for that if you're a fan! One of the most interesting games shown so far was Thick as Thieves, a stealth action game that looks heavily inspired by Dishonored. It's coming to Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5. This new 2D action platformer looks pretty fun, and there's good news: it's coming to all major platforms in 2025! That means Xbox, PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Another adorable cozy game that fans of Lords of the Rings will love is Tales of the Shire. It's headed to Xbox, PC, PS5, and Switch on March 25, 2025, and seems to be a farming/life simulator. Pugstorm, the team behind the critically acclaimed open-world survival crafting game Core Keeper, have announced Kyora — a new title that looks a whole lot like a spiritual successor to Terraria. You can wishlist it on Steam now. Sloclap, the team behind the high-octane action fighting game Sifu, decided they wanted to make a soccer game. And so, we have Rematch. Online soccer action! It's coming to Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation in summer 2025. Solasta 2 is a new tactical turn-based RPG that looks a whole lot like a Baldur's Gate-style tabletop game, and it's hitting Early Access on Steam in 2025. A free demo is coming soon, too! Slay the Spire's sequel has been highly anticipated for quite a while now, and we finally got a detailed new trailer at The Game Awards show. It's coming at some point next year in Early Access. Wow, Harrison Ford at The Game Awards! That's quite a surprise. I suppose it's fitting, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proving to be a big hit! It was cool to see him next Troy Baker. What a surprise! CD PROJEKT RED has blown everyone away by revealing The Witcher 4, the long-awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs of all time, with an extended cinematic trailer. We won't be playing as Geralt this time, though; instead, you'll take control of none other than Ciri herself. Oh, nobody expected this! FromSoftware is making Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new co-op adventure game set in the developer's grand fantasy world. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation next year! Team Ico, the developer behind Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian, made an appearance at The Game Awards 2024 with a trailer for a mysterious new game. We didn't get a name, but unsurprisingly, it's got huge scale — gigantic robots, specifically. Get hyped! The Outer Worlds 2, the sequel to Obsidian Entertainment's popular 2019 sci-fi RPG, is coming to Xbox, PC, and PS5 in 2025! At The Game Awards, it got an amusing new trailer that confirmed its release date. We've known it's coming for quite a while, but this was the first time we actually got a look at it. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios had a big showing at The Game Awards, announcing its next co-op game Split Fiction. Uniquely, the game's levels feature a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy environments, so it should offer quite an interesting gameplay experience to enjoy with a friend. Oh, and it's scheduled to come out March 6! The popular 2014 winter survival game The Long Dark is one of the most atmospheric I've ever played, so I was excited to see that a sequel called The Long Dark 2: Blackfrost got announced during the show. It's expected to enter Early Access in 2026! The Borderlands 4 trailer we knew was coming today got shown, and it looks like it'll offer all the explosive action longtime fans crave. It's coming to Xbox, Steam, and PlayStation in 2025, which was a nice surprise to learn about! Those who have been following the mech action title Mecha BREAK will be happy to know it's officially scheduled to drop next year in spring, and will be available on Xbox and PC. Interestingly, it will have an advanced AI NPC that can answer pretty much any question you ask it. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, announced what looks to be a new action game called Project Century. The dev also briefly went over what looks to be something new for the Virtua Fighter series. Few specific details were given, though! CALLING ALL HELLDIVERS! Helldivers 2 had a HUGE showing at The Game Awards, with a new Omens of Tyranny update going LIVE shortly after a trailer that showed off the arrival of the Illuminate faction, urban city maps, the long-awaited APC vehicle, and more! I know what I'm playing the second I'm done covering this show! A short trailer was shown for Palworld's upcoming Feybreak update during the show, with a December 23 release date revealed. On that day, you'll be able to play on Xbox, PC, and PS5. Fans of Onimusha, a classic Capcom action/adventure franchise, will be happy to hear that we're getting a brand new entry called Way of the Sword in 2026. The cinematic trailer shown didn't include gameplay, but it sure did have plenty of bloody samurai action. It's coming to Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC. Techland's parkour-heavy survival action franchise Dying Light is getting its next entry with Dying Light: The Beast, and today we learned it's scheduled to release on Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC in summer 2025. The news came alongside a sweet new trailer with plenty of zombie-slaying action. Well hey, would you look at that! A Game of Thrones action/adventure game that's coming in 2025, complete with characters from the popular HBO TV show and plenty of medieval-fantasy action. It's platforms haven't been revealed yet, though! Did The Last of Us Part 2 need a remaster? No. Would one make a ton of money? Definitely. Therefore, Sony and Naughty Dog remastered it this year, and are now bringing it to PC next year on April 3, 2025. The new Mafia game, The Old Country, got teased well before The Game Awards itself, and now we finally got to see its debut trailer during it. It's coming in summer 2025, so it's coming soon! Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul and world-famous video game voice actress Laura Bailey star in a new story adventure game called Dispatch that's coming in 2025. Its stylized art direction looks great, and I'm looking forward to checking it out next year. That's another one we definitely didn't see coming! Okami, Capcom's beloved single player action/adventure game from 2006, is finally getting a sequel. It got announced during an amazing The Game Awards Orchestra performance, and is entering production shortly. Another huge surprise! Naughty Dog showed up with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a new PS5 game that's apparently been in development for four years now. Here's a quote from the trailer's description: "Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit." And Astro Bot takes home the prestigious Game of the Year win! Congratulations to Team ASOBI on its victory, and to all the other games that were nominated. I was definitely expecting Black Myth: Wukong or Metaphor: ReFantazio to win, so this was quite a surprise! The Game Awards 2024 is now officially over, but man, what a show it was — an absolutely colossal three and a half hour ceremony with a crazy amount of new trailers and reveals, including many announcements that blew us away! Below, I've rounded up our in-depth coverage of all the highlights for you to read through if you missed the event... ...and also the trailers that slipped through my rapidly typing fingers due to the event's rapid pace: Thanks for sticking with me for the show! I'll write up more of my full thoughts shortly, but overall, I thought this was easily one of the best The Game Awards shows ever...even if it was extremely long. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Coming off of last year's extremely disappointing The Game Awards show that was rife with speeches rushed by "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" signs, tons of annoying advertisements, and zero attempts to raise awareness about the gaming industry's ongoing layoff issues at all, I wasn't exactly feeling optimistic about the 2024 iteration of the event. Yet while it still had a few too many ads for my liking, I have to say that I'm still extremely impressed by what Geoff Keighley and company put together this time around. Not only were there a series of truly wild announcements — the reveal of the dedicated co-op game Elden Ring: Nightreign blew my mind, other huge titles like The Witcher 4 looked fantastic too, and oh my god, that Helldivers 2 Illuminate update shadow drop — but we also got some fantastic musical performances, plenty of great speeches from developers speaking from the heart, and an entire segment dedicated to discussing the layoffs. Put simply, that was one of the best The Game Awards shows Geoff Keighley and his teams have put on yet, and it might even be the best one. I suppose that's only fitting for the event's 10th anniversary! Whether you watched The Game Awards alongside myself and my co-workers live or you used this live blog to keep tabs on all the big announcements and award results, thank you for joining me tonight. Myself and the rest of the Windows Central Gaming team will continue writing up our thoughts, reactions, and maybe even a few spicy hot takes tonight and tomorrow, though, so stay tuned for additional commentary. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 have concluded, and I'm honestly pleasantly surprised as a whole. Geoff Keighley seems to have taken feedback from previous years, resulting in a show that's more self-aware, more willing to poke fun at itself, more transparent, and more open to addressing the current events of the video games industry. There were a lot of great game announcements and performances, too, and most of the game award categories felt uncharacteristically reasonable. I was in high spirits (apart from my crushing exhaustion, my gods what a long show) up until the end, when the Game of the Year was announced. In my eyes, only one game truly earned the title in 2024, as the game with the most unyielding narrative impact, memorable art design, worldbuilding, and music, and enrapturing mixed-genre RPG gameplay. Of course, I'm speaking about Metaphor: ReFantazio, which has stood uncontested as my personal GotY since I reviewed it. Don't get me wrong, Astro Bot is a phenomenal 3D platformer with practically zero flaws, and I'm happy The Game Awards took time to recognize Astro Bot in a variety of categories. Smaller, less ambitious games like Astro Bot are often overlooked entirely, so I loved seeing it awarded alongside other brilliant games this year like Neva and Balatro. Despite its excellence, though, I don't believe Astro Bot was the best choice for Game of the Year. While perfectly polished, accessible to players of all ages, and a highlight of PlayStation's first-party output this year (we won't talk about Concord), Astro Bot feels like the safe play for The Game Awards. In contrast, Metaphor: ReFantazio is bold, obviously making zero attempt to appeal to mainstream audiences and instead focusing on delivering the absolute best gameplay, story, world and character building, and art design possible. It succeeds, to the point where I almost began a New Game+ immediately after rolling the credits on my 85-hour playthrough. I almost never feel like that with games, I often begin burning out around the 40-hour mark. Still, while I may disagree... Congratulations to Astro Bot on winning Game of the Year, Best Game Direction (Metaphor: ReFantazio also should've won that, cough cough), Best Action/Adventure Game, and Best Family Game. Of course, congratulations to Atlus and Metaphor: ReFantazio on winning Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. You should've swept with Best Score and Music, too. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Nothing is ever perfect, but I'll say that this year's show was significantly better than what we saw in 2023. Developers were actually given a bit of time to accept their awards without being hurried along, and even if it wasn't too sharply pointed, we did get some commentary about the awful layoffs that have ravaged the industry over the last two years. Well done to Keighley and crew for accepting at least some of the feedback levied since last year. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Brendan Lowry is a Windows Central writer and Oakland University graduate with a burning passion for video games, of which he's been an avid fan since childhood.

Geoff Bennett Geoff Bennett Azhar Merchant Azhar Merchant Leave your feedback Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs. It's the latest hit for the Post, coming just days after longtime editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned in protest. A series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash are raising questions about owner Jeff Bezos and the leadership of the Post. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Kara Swisher. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs that are expected to be announced this week. It's the latest hit for The Post, coming just days after a longtime editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, resigned in protest. Her editor rejected her latest cartoon, which depicted Post owner Jeff Bezos and other media leaders on bended knee before president-elect Trump. The Post said the cartoon was rejected because it had been repetitive of a recent column and another that was set to be published. Her editor in the statement said, in part: "Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force." To many observers, though, it's the latest in a series of events that are raising questions about Bezos and the leadership of The Post, including a series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash. For more on that, we're joined now by Kara Swisher, multiplatform journalist, entrepreneur, and author of "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story." Thanks so much for being with us. Kara Swisher, Author, "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story": Thank you for having me. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention that you are putting together an investor group to buy The Washington Post. Jeff Bezos has… Kara Swisher: I'm thinking about it, yes. Geoff Bennett: Thinking about it. Kara Swisher: Yes, I have been talking — I'm talking to a lot of people because I'm just disturbed by what's happening there. I'm sure other people are too. The question is if he wants to sell it. He hasn't indicated any interest whatsoever, but I wanted to raise the idea because I think it needs new leadership and new management. Geoff Bennett: And — right, I was going to say he's given no indication that he intends to sell it. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: But what's the vision? Why are you in the hunt? Kara Swisher: Well, I started off at The Washington Post in the newsroom — in the mailroom. Excuse me. That's where I started my career when I was at college at Georgetown University. And so that was my first job. And I worked there for many years. I started covering the Internet there, which is my big area. I went on to work at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and did a whole bunch of different things, including a very famous tech conference that was pretty good. And so I have been watching what's happening at The Post for a long time. And I was quite heartened when the Grahams, family which had owned it for so many years, sold it to Jeff Bezos. And in the initial years, he did a very good job. He got it for a very low amount of money, by the way. But he was doing a very good job. And it's just recently that his business interests are not aligned with The Post. And everything he's done so far over the past, I don't know, year or so has been pretty questionable, I would say, not because necessarily it's malign. I don't — I mean, bringing in malign forces, it sort of takes it to a new level. I think he has business interests that are not aligned with The Post. And some of his selections have been bad, including pulling the endorsement of Kamala Harris at the last minute. There's always some excuse. He didn't see it. He didn't read it. It doesn't really matter. He's involving himself in ways that are aren't working for The Post, which is also in distress as a business at this moment. Geoff Bennett: Well, on that point, I mean, strong journalistic ethics prioritize independence. Kara Swisher: Sure. Geoff Bennett: And Jeff Bezos obviously isn't a journalist. He's a businessman. Kara Swisher: No, of course. Geoff Bennett: And you can make the argument that he has a fiduciary responsibility to minimize any scrutiny or retaliation that could affect The Post or his broader media empire. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: I mean, what do you say to that argument? Kara Swisher: Well, there's only one shareholder here, and that's Jeff Bezos. So he can do whatever he wants. So it's not like it's a public company, and there's other things. But other public companies have been very explicit that they're going to do fair and accountability coverage of the things. And I think some of the actions he's taken, including with Ann, who's an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, I don't think Jeff had anything to do with this decision. I think it was done by David Shipley. But it's in this mood of not poking the bear, I think, the bear being Trump or Jeff Bezos. I don't know which one they're not trying to poke. But what happened to The Post was, Jeff bought it in 2013 and did a lot of stuff that improved it, but they never really figured out what to do post the first Trump era, which gave a bump to a lot of people. And so, in many ways, it's his fault of where it is. And now he's doing things that are making it worse. And I'm not sure why, right? I'm not sure what's happening with him. And I think he's — again, he's been a very good owner until recently, I would say. And now he just doesn't — I'd like to know why he wants to own it, what his plans are. The plans that they have outlined seem preposterous, really. I don't know what else to say. He's a very good businessperson, but a lot of these ideas are really an antithesis of what an independent newspaper should be. And I don't mean to stay in the past. And The Post has a storied history. I'm a journalist who's blown up a lot of things. I believe in changing and shifting. But you have to come up with something that preserves the integrity of The Post and at the same time makes it into a pretty good business. Geoff Bennett: Are there lessons The Post could learn from The New York Times' multimedia diversification… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … or from the rise of digital native outlets like Axios or Substack or Semafor? The list goes on. Kara Swisher: Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I did the first one, which was called AllThingsD at The Wall Street… Geoff Bennett: That's right. Yes. Kara Swisher: We — Walt and I — Walt Mossberg were the O.G. of all this stuff. It's funny when it's like, oh, this is new. I'm like, no, we did it a long time ago, because we did see what was coming and the importance of digitization of media and how the consumer had changed really drastically. And we also supplemented it by having a conference that was highly lucrative that could pay the bills too, because news is hard. Advertising is tougher. Some people have done subscriptions really well. Like, The Information does great journalism and does subscriptions. Other things rely on advertising, like we did at AllThingsD, or sponsorship like we did at the Code Conferences. There's all kinds of things you could look at, and The New York Times is one way of doing it. They do everything, they cook everything internally, right? But they did an important diversification. News is not the driver of the growth of The New York Times right now. It's Wordle. It's cooking. It's sports. It's all kinds of things. And that's important, for a news organization to have multiple revenue streams around it, especially as people, especially young people, go off and get things from TikTok or Instagram or wherever they happen — or YouTube, for example, has become critically important in the TV watching space. And so The Post hasn't really done anything. They don't have a podcast division to speak of. Other companies have done a really good job at that, and it can be very lucrative. I have some ideas, which I will outline if I get a meeting with Jeff. I have known him for — I knew — I met Jeff before he was a billionaire, when he first started Amazon. He's a wonderful entrepreneur. And I think he has to understand that maybe where he is today is not where he was and that he may not be the correct owner for this thing. That's all. I just want to talk to you about it and understand why he wants to own it if he continues to do these things that are causing a huge amount of people to leave, very — a huge amount of talent. And that's not — that's hard to get back. So I have some ideas of different structures, financial structures, the way you could do it, and I'm sure other people do. Geoff Bennett: Well, if you could redesign the current media ecosystem to better serve the public in this polarized… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … fractured and fast-paced era, what would you prioritize, especially since, after this last election, we learned to the degree to which legacy media has limited reach and limited influence? Kara Swisher: Yes. Well, that's been happening for a long time. It's something I warned of in my book and many — for years and years, I wrote this column. I'm like, everything that — the thing I said over and over again is, everything that can be digitized will be digitized and it was, right? This was at the beginning of my career. And I think one of the things they have to recognize is, where is the audience? The audience has taken control of the media. And it's not giving it back any time soon. So you go where they are going, you try to create things they want to consume. It doesn't have to be light. It doesn't have to — there's a terrible word in media, make it snackable. I think that's the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. But make it interesting. I mean, I have a million ideas of what you can do and how you could structure it so it's more protected. But being at the mercy and kindness of billionaires, good luck with that. I'm sorry. It's — maybe a lot of billionaires, so none of them have control, but a single billionaire? I don't care how you slice it. And I don't know how nice that billionaire is. It's never going to end well. It just isn't. Geoff Bennett: Kara Swisher, thanks for joining us. We deeply appreciate it.

Title: Report -- 'The Cuts Will Be Deep': Washington Post to Lay Off Dozens of Staffers

The Washington Post will reportedly lay off dozens of its staffers in the next few days, the news coming after the publication caught flak for not endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris (D) during the presidential election that Donald Trump won in November. In his article published on Status, Oliver Darcy wrote Sunday that “the layoffs are slated to hit the Jeff Bezos-owned and Will Lewis-led newspaper’s business division, I’m told. One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees.” Bezos has reportedly been shaking up the Post after it decided not to endorse Harris, according to Breitbart News. Darcy continued: The layoffs will surely deplete morale further inside the beleaguered newspaper, which has suffered a talent exodus over the last several weeks. As I reported earlier, star reporter Josh Dawsey will exit The Post for a job at The Wall Street Journal. His departure comes on the heels of other top staffers fleeing, including Matea Gold, Ashely Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz. The newspaper has been struggling financially and the issues were “exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” he added. In November, the Post‘s senior politics editor claimed the newspaper removed him, per Breitbart News. After his decision not to endorse Harris, Bezos offered Trump a “big congratulations” on his “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” According to Breitbart News, Bezos, who founded Amazon, has large contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the Post and accused her editor of killing a drafted cartoon due to its mocking depiction of Bezos and Trump, Breitbart News reported Sunday: “I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations — and some differences — about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now,” Telnaes said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke Staffers at The Washington Post are braced for a wave of layoffs that could reshape the paper’s future, with cuts expected to be announced this week, according to a new report from Oliver Darcy. Darcy’s Status newsletter reported Sunday that one source said that the layoffs will focus on the newspaper’s “business division” and impact “dozens of employees.” “One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees,” Darcy wrote. These anticipated layoffs follow an exodus of prominent talent after the newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently lost a number of big names, including managing editor Matea Gold, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz – several of which were poached by The Atlantic. The news comes just after Darcy broke the news that reporter Josh Dawsey was set to leave The Post to join the Wall Street Journal. According to Status, The Post’s struggles are partly attributed to finances that have seen better days. Those familiar with internal discussions say that top management has not kept these challenges under wraps. “Those financial problems were exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” Darcy noted. A spokesperson for The Post declined to offer immediate comment to Status on the revelation. Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

Title: Intel's rise and fall: A timeline of what went wrong

Time Published: 2025-01-06T09:15:00Z

Getty Images Intel has been a dominant player for much of the modern computing age. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. The company's name comes from the phrase "integrated electronics." In the 1980s, Intel established the x86 CPU architecture, which became the standard in consumer and many business applications for several decades. Intel's hardware portfolio spans consumer and enterprise CPUs, memory, storage and networking technologies. The company also develops software that supports its hardware and contributes to open source software development. In recent years, Intel has faced increasing competition, leading the company to fall from grace. Rival x86 chipmaker AMD has been aggressively challenging Intel's share with its performance gains. Alternative chip architectures, including Arm, have become increasingly popular leading to further erosion of Intel's dominance. GPU maker Nvidia has outpaced Intel in the AI space leading to even further losses. The market challenges have hit Intel hard. Intel's stock has been steadily declining, dropping by over 50% in 2024 alone. In November 2024, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced with Nvidia because S&P Global representatives said Nvidia was more representative of the semiconductor industry and Nvidia's share price was higher than Intel's. Then in December 2024, CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced to retire as the company's board of directors looked to reset the ailing company's direction. Intel was not an instant success. Intel's rise was achieved over decades of milestones and innovations that helped the company to succeed. 1971. Intel created its first CPU, the 4004. However, the company was initially more successful with its SRAM and DRAM memory chips. 1981. The biggest early win for Intel came in 1981 when IBM selected Intel's 8088 processor for its PCs. 1982. The 80286 -- commonly referred to as just the '286' -- processor debuted, introducing separate data buses and memory management capabilities. 1985. The 80386, or 386, debuted marking Intel's first production 32-bit architecture chip, with support of 4GB of memory. 1989. The 80486, or i486. was released further advancing Intel's CPU performance. With its integrated features and on-chip cache, it was the first x86 processor to have more than 1 million transistors. 1991. Intel launched its Intel Inside marketing campaign for PCs with its chips, and television commercials became a cultural phenomenon. The public's understanding of CPUs and what was inside a PC was lacking prior to that campaign. 1993. Intel rebranded its processors under the Pentium name. 1998. Intel debuts the Xeon process line for servers. 1999. Intel and Windows maker Microsoft -- commonly referred to as Wintel -- are added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 2005. Apple transitions its Macintosh computers from Motorola's PowerPC to Intel's x86 processors, leading to a 15-year partnership. While Intel gained early success in the PC market, its decline was marked by the company's failure to quickly recognize growth and potential new markets. In the early 2000s, with the early era of mobile computing, Intel had a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Apple asked Intel to help supply chips to power the iPhone in 2007. Then Intel CEO Paul Otellini declined the deal, on the premise that he didn't think the iPhone was going to be a high-volume business. Apple ended up going with an Arm-based chip, and today, Arm dominates the mobile space. Intel's decline is also a testament to the intense competition in the market. Rival chip makers have been actively aiming at Intel on multiple fronts. In 2017, AMD introduced its Ryzen processors, providing comparable or superior performance to the equivalent Intel chips of the day, albeit at a lower price point. Chip fabrication has also been an area of weakness for Intel as the company struggled to transition to smaller, more efficient chip designs. This allowed competitors, such as TSMC and Samsung, to effectively challenge Intel in silicon manufacturing capabilities. Intel's decline is also directly related to how it missed out on properly developing competitive GPU technology and taking part in the AI revolution. GPUs have become an essential technology in AI accelerators which are the foundation of generative AI. In the early era of GPUs during the late 1990s, Nvidia as well as ATI -- acquired by AMD in 2006 -- led the market. Intel tried unsuccessfully to build its own GPU technology including the i740 which ultimately was abandoned. Instead, Intel focused on developing integrated graphics capabilities for its processors, which never attracted much attention from gamers who rely on GPUs. In 2019, Intel acquired Habana Labs for $2 billion to enter the AI accelerator market. The Habana Guadi processors have not kept pace with Nvidia. For example, the Gaudi 3 chip announced in April 2024 did not compare favorably against the leading edge of Nvidia's portfolio. In November 2024, Intel admitted during an earnings call that the Gaudi processor was going to miss the company's revenue targets. Intel has made other mistakes and missed opportunities that have hurt the company's position. Itanium was a processor family that debuted in 2001. It developed through a partnership between Intel and Hewlett-Packard and derived from HP's PA-RISC architecture. The original goal was to create a new server architecture that would have positioned Intel for server dominance. The chips, however, did not offer proper x86 compatibility and were ultimately surpassed in the market by x86-64 architecture originally developed by AMD. Intel released the final Itanium processor in 2017. Intel's acquisition strategy also includes a series of expensive missteps. Despite paying $7.7 billion to acquire security vendor McAfee in 2010, Intel could not successfully integrate the business into Intel in a way that would have benefited the entire organization. Intel spun McAfee out into a separate company in 2016. In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15 billion and failed to fully benefit from the technology of mobile innovations into Intel's core technology platform. Mobileye was spun out as its own company in 2022. Intel's struggles extended to its product development and quality control. In 2024, Intel faced multiple class-action lawsuits over instability issues with its 13th and 14th-generation Raptor Lake processors. One of the biggest missed opportunities was in 2017 when Intel was offered and declined to invest in OpenAI. This deal would have required the AI pioneer to use Intel hardware. Though Intel faces multiple challenges it is still a strong technology vendor with options. Analysts contacted by Informa TechTarget provided their thoughts on what Intel should do to survive. The Intel 18A is an underdevelopment initiative from Intel for the next generation of semiconductor technology. The 18A refers to the size of transistors at 1.8 angstroms, or Å, and this smaller transistor size offers more computing performance packed into a chip. The Intel 18A strategy also includes the development of a new architecture known as RibbonFET, or Ribbon Field Effect Transistor, which Intel claims offers more performance per watt than prior chip architecture designs. "Intel doesn't have any quick and easy solutions," said Raj Joshi, senior vice president of Moody's Ratings. "It needs to execute its Intel 18A process node technology plan and demonstrate it can produce high volumes of wafers cost-effectively on that node. It also needs to execute its product design plans more effectively." Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, believes that Intel needs to get back to leadership with PCs, data center CPUs and data center GPUs. "Intel made strides in PC and data center CPU designs but is still losing market share," Moorhead stated. Moorhead believes Intel has the right idea with Gaudi in AI data centers, but the hyperscalers have built their own. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have their own accelerators. Moorhead noted that for training and inference, the entire market wants high-performance, low-precision bit-rate GPUs. Beyond technology innovation, Moorhead suggests that Intel needs to be more efficient overall. "It's not just about cutting headcount. It's changing how work gets done," Moorhead said. "Intel needs to beware of cutting too much in sales and marketing or they're going to invite AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia to take market share." Olivier Blanchard, practice lead at Futurum's Devices, said Intel's path forward shouldn't focus on correcting past mistakes. "Unfortunately, Intel can't climb into a time machine and erase any of the decisions that created the challenges it faces today," Blanchard said. For instance, he added that Intel couldn't reboot its GPU business quickly enough to compensate for a decade of misses and failures. According to Blanchard, Intel needs to create as many paths to revenue growth as possible -- including its fabrication business -- which Intel has the chance to achieve with support from the CHIPS and Science Act funding. "I also expect that Intel's importance to U.S. national security and broad economic interests will continue to give it access to a wide set of onshoring and chip fab repatriation opportunities," Blanchard said. "Execution is a whole different story, but the opportunity is there." Forrester Research analyst Alvin Nguyen says that Intel needs a new CEO to lead the company in the right direction. In Nguyen's view, Intel needs their new CEO to do the following: Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer. He has pulled Token Ring, configured NetWare and been known to compile his own Linux kernel. He consults with industry and media organizations on technology issues.

Title: Disney, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery And SAG-AFTRA Join Growing Industry Roster Set For Tech Talk At CES

By Dade Hayes Business Editor In addition to its main purpose as a showcase for the latest gadgets, CES has long been a meeting ground for entertainment players. This year’s edition, getting under way Monday in Las Vegas, will be no exception and is unfolding amid an elevated sense of urgency for traditional media companies to get right with the lords of technology. With theatrical box office and linear television in decline and layoffs continuing to thin the industry’s ranks, tech provides in some ways a welcome source of optimism despite its many complications and a culture still distinct from Hollywood’s. Related Stories News 'Cross' Star Aldis Hodge, Amazon MGM Studios Exec Lauren Anderson On How Show's D.C. Flavor Draws Viewers And Advertisers Executives Disney Promotes Theatrical Distribution Head Tony Chambers To President EMEA On top of CES mainstays like Sony, Panasonic and other hardware firms holding court again with massive booths, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and SAG-AFTRA are among those with a presence. NBCUniversal, Amazon, Roku and Fox Corp. are among many making announcements and having execs on panels. Two of the confab’s handful of keynote speeches are by the CEOs of SiriusXM and Nvidia. Watch on Deadline The latter company, which has had a meteoric rise to a $3.5 trillion market cap, is more than 30 years old but until recent years hasn’t been thought of as particularly connected with Hollywood. Its AI chips and technology are now central to animation, special effects and many other parts of the industry. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who took one of history’s biggest swings at CES by unveiling the venture-funded (and ultimately short-lived) streaming startup Quibi there in 2020, is returning to help kick off OpenAP’s Audience Summit. The industry consortium’s half-day event will feature high-level execs (Amazon’s Krishan Bhatia, Fox Corp.’s Jeff Collins and TelevisaUnivision’s Donna Speciale among them) discussing the challenges and opportunities of streaming. Michael Kassan, former head of MediaLink, will once again preside as a panel moderator and connector via his new company, 3C Ventures. The exec had a bitter and public breakup with UTA, which acquired MediaLink and then fell out with Kassan. The two have exchanged lawsuits. UTA and MediaLink, for their part, are also making the scene in Las Vegas, hosting a party with a musical performance by Meghan Trainor. Advertising has become a key theme at CES as dollars continue to shift from traditional buckets into digital and streaming. “It’s like a kickoff to the upfronts,” NBCU head of advertising and partnerships Mark Marshall told Deadline in an interview. “We really start our upfront conversations at CES, so it has been a priority for us.” NBCU is looking to build interest across a number of major tentpoles heading toward the company’s 100th anniversary in fall 2026. “We’re really looking at ’25 and ’26 as one thing,” Marshall said. A new edition of BravoCon, golf’s Ryder Cup, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, the 60th Super Bowl, the NBA’s return; the FIFA World Cup on Telemundo – “All of those things were not on NBC in this upfront,” he noted, meaning the next one “will be a massive one for us.” Disney, similarly, has positioned its prelude to the upfronts, the Global Tech + Data Showcase, as an annual live CES presentation, delivered by livestream to those not in Las Vegas. “We have really invested, over the last decade, in technology that differentiates us from all of our traditional competitors,” Disney President of Global Advertising Rita Ferro explained in a recent in-house interview. “We can also compete with any of the new technology platforms, and what sets us apart across all of those is truly our scale. The ability to have the amount of content that we have across sports, which is a hugely popular marketplace right now in terms of advertisers and where they’re spending their dollars, is also a differentiator.” WBD, meanwhile, has also been ramping up its brand efforts on Max, deploying sponsor integrations and targeted advertising. The third season of HBO’s White Lotus, which will premiere in mid-February, is the focus of a “Taste of Thailand” party at CES, complete with a synergistic cooking demonstration by a Food Network chef preparing the cuisine of this season’s setting. Analysts looking at the intersection of entertainment and technology continue to see upside for the companies that manage to make the most of shifting consumer habit. Tim Nollen of Macquarie last month took note of a study by the Association of National Advertisers showing year-over-year improvements in the ad value chain. “Ad tech is becoming more efficient,” Nollen wrote, with figures in the report that “seem to point to an ad tech market that is growing up, with scaled players accruing benefits.” Technology has undeniable allure, but it is also a complex force for creative stakeholders in film, TV and streaming. SAG-AFTRA, which seized on AI as a key issue in its 2023 strike against studios and streamers, is back at CES for its annual LIT Conference, short for “labor innovation and technology.” Duncan Crabtree, SAG-AFTRA’s National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, will speak at the event, as will DGA National Executive Director Russell Hollander and senior officials from the WGA, IATSE and other guilds.

Title: Here's what to expect for raises, promotions, and job-seeking in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-05T09:16:01Z

Getting a job was tough for many Americans in 2024. If a career shift is your New Year's resolution for 2025, you might still find it challenging. Job growth has slowed, unemployment has been historically low but rising, and unemployed Americans are staying jobless for longer. "Heading into 2025, it is going to be a little harder for job seekers across the board," Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in December. "We've seen that just about every category on Indeed has come down year over year in terms of the number of job postings. So that suggests that employer demand has cooled." Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, described the labor market in 2024 as unusually stable and quiet. She pointed to steadily low layoffs and a drop in voluntary turnover amid cooler hiring. "The stasis is rather abnormal, and I think it's going to make it tough for workers who are looking for new opportunities to find them," Richardson said. Here's what economists expect when it comes to job searches, wages and promotions, and other aspects of work life in 2025. One reason it would be hard for job searchers to land a job is that employers may want to see which policies Donald Trump pursues early in his second term. "While business sentiment has picked up somewhat since the election, there is still a lot of uncertainty about future policy changes that will likely make businesses hesitant to ramp up hiring, particularly in the first half of 2025," Dante DeAntonio, a labor economist with Moody's Analytics, said in a written statement. A crackdown on immigration could affect industries with higher shares of immigrant workers, like the construction sector. DeAntonio said those industries "may find themselves scrambling for workers if material changes to immigration policy are enacted." DeAntonio identified the leisure and hospitality industry and agriculture as two others that have historically depended on immigrant labor and could be affected by changes. The new administration could also affect government workers and job seekers. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is figuring out suggestions for cutting federal spending and regulations. "A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy," Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed article published by The Wall Street Journal. Employment growth in the federal government has cooled. From November 2022 to November 2023 the federal government added 77,000 jobs, but it added just 49,000 over the following year. "Depending on how things go with the new administration, we may see a lot of government workers either losing their jobs or quitting," said Brian Rose, a senior US economist for UBS's chief investment office. "This could be an opportunity for private-sector companies to pick up some skilled workers." Richardson said white-collar job seekers, like those searching for tech roles, should be ready to network and wait longer to get a job. "It's not that these jobs don't exist, and it's not that there's not opportunities out there, but the opportunities that people had gotten used to prior to 2024 have slowed," Richardson said. "This economy coming out of the pandemic really thrived on tech jobs." DeAntonio said white-collar industries were "likely to remain at the top of the list as difficult for job seekers to enter, as those firms have been some of the most cautious in terms of hiring." Stahle said lots of jobs were still available in construction and manufacturing, even if opportunities have slowed from a year or two ago. But Stahle said jobs in software development, marketing, and other knowledge work were "hit much harder" by the job-market slowdown. "I think it's going to continue to be kind of a divergence in the labor market where some job seekers will have an easy time next year, albeit a little harder than last year, and then some are going to have a harder time than they've had in a few years," Stahle said in an interview in 2024. Rose said the difficulty of landing work depended on a person's job experience and field of work. While hiring might be rough in finance and tech, construction is one industry that needs workers. Rose said construction and skilled workers for smaller companies were in high demand. He said he also thinks lower-paying jobs are in demand. "If you're in healthcare or the skilled trades, you're in the right place," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said. "If you're anywhere else, you might want to reevaluate your career choices and look into reskilling and broadening your search." Healthcare has had large job growth relative to other industries and has largely maintained its growth rate even as broader hiring has slowed. Richardson sees a hopeful outlook for the interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, as the Federal Reserve has cut rates in its past few meetings. "As we're seeing the Fed continue to try to draw down rates, manufacturing might benefit from that, and new sources of technology and tech advancement, that leads to more hiring in the sector," Richardson said. In December, AT&T said it wanted its office workers fully back to the workplace. Amazon also told employees they needed to fully work from the office, but it has delayed the January 2 deadline for some. "We are likely to see a continuation of the mixed bag of workplace policy changes that occurred this year," DeAntonio said. "Some firms will undoubtedly make a stronger return-to-office push, especially now as workers seem less inclined to switch jobs as they have in recent years." Despite those moves, the share of white-collar employees working outside the office has risen. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 46% of workers in management, business, and financial-operations occupations worked remotely at least part of the time in November, up from 41% a year earlier. Stahle described the outlook for raises, compensation, and promotions as promising. But he added that "we don't want to see wages necessarily pick up to a point where they could fuel inflation." Stahle argued that hiring needed to pick up, particularly for roles that haven't had robust growth, to have a soft landing, where inflation slows to the Fed's 2% target while unemployment and layoffs stay steady. "We want to see people continuing to have decent wage growth, especially wage growth that keeps their purchasing power up and above inflation," Stahle said. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings was 4% in November, down from the growth rate in 2022 and the roughly 4.4% increase at the start of the year, though it has outpaced cooling inflation since mid-2023. Rose said he thought wage growth would most likely moderate further. "There's just better balance in the labor market so less need for companies to raise their wages to attract workers," Rose said. But DeAntonio said immigration policy changes could make the labor market even tighter, which would "increase leverage for employees in seeking bigger pay increases." Stahle said the job market could be challenging for young people. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates — people who are 22 to 27 — has been ticking up, but it falls short of the rate for those without a degree in this age group. Rose said he thought that "recent college grads who went to some private college and spent a lot of money and looking for a high-paying, entry-level job to justify that investment" were having a tough time in the job market.

Title: The End Of Management? Gen Z Faces New Challenges In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/01/03/the-end-of-management-gen-z-faces-new-challenges-in-2025/

Gen Z faces the disappearance of management jobs in 2025. In 2025, it’s predicted that 1 in 10 management roles will be filled by Gen Z. But that’s a complicated statistic, when management jobs are going the way of the milk man and the fax machine. Forbes highlights the stark reality of white-collar job cuts, with middle-management positions being systematically eliminated at organizations like Google, Meta, UPS and others. Indeed, middle management positions accounted for nearly a third of layoffs in 2023, according to reports from Live Data Technologies. That’s bad news for Gen Z workers seeking guidance, mentoring and oversight. Or a white-collar job in management. Is management a disappearing career? CNBC reports that Amazon is shifting to an individual-contributor model - a type of unbossing that could foster the elimination of as many as 14,000 management roles. Other companies are making similar moves on a smaller scale, cutting into the middle to improve the bottom line. What’s really at work here? Is AI making middle management positions redundant? “Digital transformation plays a significant role,” according to Joseph Roh, a professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University who commented on the unbossing trend on CNBC. “Automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software.” While management is disappearing, employee engagement is suffering. Gallup notes that the connection between employees and managers is a driving force behind performance and employee wellbeing, stating that “the role of the manager has never been more important”. But is it really? The crisis for Gen Z isn’t that thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. The key takeaway here is that these jobs don’t really exist anymore. Is it any wonder that employee engagement is in the ditch, and Forbes reports that 52% of Gen Z workers don’t want to be middle managers? Self-leadership is the direction for Gen Z, but navigating without guidance might be the real challenge. In a Harris poll, 82% of managers said that Gen Z new hires need more training in soft skills. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of Gen Z employees say that these highly-desired soft skills can’t be taught, and can only be developed by watching more seasoned employees over time. A Catch-22 is the result of these mutually conflicting conditions. It’s the classic chicken and the egg paradox: how do you gain valuable experience without the opportunity to gain valuable experience? Or be managed by those who can share it? The Harris Poll revealed that over half of Gen Z employees feel underprepared for professional roles, citing a lack of soft-skill training during their formative years (read: COVID). How do you demonstrate what you have not observed, learned or experienced? Over half of Gen Z employees say that a lack of interpersonal training makes them afraid of “asking dumb questions”. According to the survey, nearly 60% of Gen Z employees don’t know who to turn to for help with their soft skills. Perhaps because their manager was recently fired? Linda Jingfang Cai, VP of talent development at LinkedIn, told Fortune that soft skills are “the currency of the future workplace”. She said that any company helmed by people who don’t prioritize empathy and connection will lose out on this vital currency. As AI further integrates itself into business operations, soft skills are becoming more significant in 2025. Think judgment, teamwork, and articulating a vision—even a vision for the next phase of AI. Coaching can augment unknowns, accelerate experience and provide a safe space for “dumb questions”. Here are three actionable ways coaching can help: For Gen Z, the workplace of 2025 is a crucible of opportunity and challenge - with more of the latter inhibiting the former. If engagement and performance are going to be a part of the future of work, individuals and organizations have to access new skills, now. Self-leadership has never been more important than it is now. That trend is only going to continue in the age of AI. Through a commitment to coaching and skill-building, Gen Z and employers can bridge the management gap - and be better prepared for the future of work.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year. Rivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. After its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive. Even with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier. Rivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.” Rivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.

Title: Secret Level asked Microsoft about an awesome Halo and Doom crossover — "Crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood," but Microsoft said: "Nah."

An interview with the creators of Secret Level revealed how crossover episode pitches to id Software and Microsoft fell flat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I still remember when I first heard about Xbox making a Halo TV show. I'm not reminiscing about when the Paramount TV show was announced, but when they first mentioned that Steven Spielberg would be directing it in 2013. An entire decade before. It was around the time of the Xbox One announcement and launch. The Halo TV show was part of the whole "all your entertainment in a single box" push. It was meant to usher in a new age at Microsoft, one that focused on programming and content for the customer. After years of hearing, "Don't worry, the Halo show is still coming," we were finally blinded by Master Cheeks. Halo fans around the globe held their gaming controllers, hoping for a cinematic Master Piece. What they received was a show that not only missed the spirit of the franchise but somehow failed to even make a decent sci-fi series.Once I heard the helmet was coming off, it was like I heard the sounds of distant Plasma Grenades echoing across the city. Lore was ignored or replaced, and we ended up with a weird romance being pitched between Master Chief and someone who wasn't Cortana. It's one of the easiest things to get right. I guess that's what made the following news all the more confusing to me. In an interview with Collider, Tim Miller and Dave Wilson, the men behind the new TV show Secret Level, revealed a few interesting tidbits that definitely caused some sore necks from the massive head turn we all did. For those unaware, Secret Level is an animated anthology series that covers the worlds of 15 different video games. Led in production by Blur Studios and Amazon MGM Studios, the series saw Pac-Man, Warhammer, Sifu, and more make the cut in the first season. It's what didn't show up that people found rather baffling. When asked whether the showrunners went after certain games, Tim Miller responded with, "I get a little chafed when I read online, and they're like, 'Hold on, these assholes took Spelunky when they could have taken Halo?' Or something like that. I'm like, 'Man, you think that we didn't talk to Halo or something?'" Dave Wilson continued later, "The creative director at ID [Software] is a good friend of ours, and so are folks at Microsoft, so we made a big plea because one of the things both Tim and I would love to do is do something that isn't currently available in the games, like crossovers. We wanted to make a Master Chief/Doom Slayer crossover episode, and I spent a whole weekend crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood. And it's exactly what Tim said; they were like, 'Nah.'" Excuse me? Microsoft said what? You had showrunners who were absolutely enthralled with the world of Halo and Doom and wanted to make something extraordinary, and you said no? Not to mention, with Blur Studios leading development, a studio that has already worked on multiple Halo games, you could have had the easiest Stick of your life. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Okay, I get it. You just released your Halo show you've been grinding to get done for almost a decade, and it bombed to the point of cancellation. Maybe you're a little Battle Rifle shy at the moment, but would it really have been any worse than what we got? Off the heels of the Halo TV show and layoffs at 343 Industries, Halo desperately needs a W. Even if a potential Halo and Doom crossover episode finds mixed reviews, it would already be infinitely better than what Paramount produced, but maybe that's the issue. Can Microsoft allow someone else to make a Halo TV show at the moment? After Paramounts failure, a successful spinoff like Secret Level could ruin the relationship between the two companies. While Halo failed, Microsoft has found success with Amazon and its award-winning take on Fallout. Netflix is also currently working on multiple Gears of War projects; there are plenty of IPs Microsoft has yet to explore. It's never a good idea to burn any bridges with a potential future partner on a project down the road. Even though Master Sheets didn't do so well with audiences, that doesn't mean Paramount is empty of video game-adapting talent. You only need to look at Sonic's success to see that (Don't look at the early trailers). Respect the source material, and it's pretty damn easy to find success. Gamers aren't a mystery. Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over sillier things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise that was worldly beloved? Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over more childish things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise, which was a box-office record-setter? At the end of the day, the fans of the series still deserve better. How freaking awesome would it be to see the Doom Slayer and Master Chief ripping apart flood-infested demons to save the human race? You could do it with minimal dialogue, too, where Chief calls out, "I need a weapon," and Doomguy tosses him a BFG with a nod. This writes itself, people! After slaying the demon race and protecting humanity once more, Chief reports back to base for a briefing, and Doomguy goes into cryo while stealing Chief's line, "Wake me when you need me." I didn't even realize how sad this whole thing was until I started writing this fanfic. Is it too late to petition Microsoft to say yes for the second season? At least the Halo Infinite storyline is pretty decent. What do you think? Let us know below or on social media. I'll be checking out the replies and conversing with anyone that wants to. If you're like me, you'll also daydream up some astonishing moments with cliche dialogue that seels the entire thing.
