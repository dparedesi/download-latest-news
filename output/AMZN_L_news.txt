Title: Googlers have questions for the company after getting smaller pay bumps

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts. More of this week's top reads: VCs are in a 'frenzy' to invest in Anduril, but good luck getting ahold of shares. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon announced this week that Jennifer Salke is stepping down as the head of Amazon MGM Studios — a move that could indicate high-level dissatisfaction with the company’s streaming strategy over the past few years. To be clear, Salke’s boss, Mike Hopkins (the head of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video), praised her work in an email to employees and described her departure as one that allows the company to “flatten our leadership structure a bit” — a recurring theme in recent tech company layoffs. In other words, Amazon does not intend to fill Salke’s role. Instead, the heads of its film and TV studios will report directly to Hopkins. But the reporting around Salke’s departure highlights Amazon’s streaming disappointments and challenges under her leadership. Previously an exec at NBC, Salke joined Amazon Studios in 2018, as the company was looking to expand beyond critically praised movies and shows into more mainstream hits. The streamer has had its share of successes since then, including “Reacher,” “Jack Ryan,” “Fallout,” and “The Boys.” It also made a big bet on “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a show whose premiere drew a record audience for Amazon but has not proven to be the world-conquering phenomenon that you’d hope for with a reported budget of more than $1 billion. And then there’s “Citadel,” an espionage show designed as the epicenter of a fictional universe of global spinoffs like “Citadel: Diana” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny.” Extensive reshoots reportedly turned “Citadel” into the second most expensive show ever made (behind only “The Rings of Power”), but its reception has been even more underwhelming. The Hollywood Reporter says the second season has been delayed from fall 2025 to spring 2026, with further spinoffs put on hold. Amazon has also struggled to get another James Bond film into production, following its acquisition of MGM in 2022. Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was their father) maintained creative control of the franchise, and a Wall Street Journal report in December suggested that Barbara Broccoli was particularly unhappy with Amazon — she was apparently annoyed in an early meeting when Salke referred to Bond as “content,” and she was even reported to have described the tech giant’s team as “idiots.” Another source said that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was, in turn, so angered by the WSJ story about Broccoli that he declared, “I don’t care what it takes, get rid of her,” with the company subsequently paying Wilson and Broccoli to give up control. Salke’s name was noticeably missing from Amazon’s triumphant announcement of the Bond deal. She will, however, be starting a new film and TV production company with a first-look deal at Amazon.

Title: The Weekly Closeout: GameStop pays for CEO’s security, layoffs at Mattel

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The gaming retailer paid nearly $270,000 last year for Ryan Cohen’s executive security, while the toy company laid off 120 workers at its headquarters. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From H&M’s Q1 store closures to Michelle Obama and Steph Curry partnering on a sports hydration drink, here’s our closeout for the week. Williams-Sonoma keeps it 500 Home retailer Williams-Sonoma on Monday announced the company’s inclusion in the S&P 500. “Being included in the S&P 500 is a significant milestone that acknowledges the power of our brand portfolio and growth strategies,” CEO Laura Alber said in a statement. “We remain committed to driving innovation, delivering exceptional products and experiences to our customers, and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.” The company’s portfolio includes its namesake brand, Williams Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark & Graham and GreenRow. Weaker gross margin hurts H&M’s profitability in Q1 H&M on Thursday reported first-quarter net sales increased 3% year over year to 55.3 billion Swedish Krona (about $5.5 billion). The company’s profitability during Q1 was negatively impacted by weaker gross margin that was affected by increased markdowns, customer investments and external factors, according to an earnings announcement. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 51.5% last year. CEO Daniel Ervér said it continued to “optimise the store portfolio” through store closures, 40 net of which shuttered during the quarter. “Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” Ervér said in a statement. Sally Beauty partners with Uber Eats Sally Beauty entered the Uber Eats platform on Tuesday, making its products available for delivery nationwide. This is Uber Eats first national beauty partnership and, to honor it, customers can get half off purchases $50 or more through March 31. “Being the first beauty retailer to partner with Uber Eats allows us to take convenience to the next level, further expanding our same-day delivery reach nationwide, making our quality products more accessible than ever before,” Natalie Lockhart, group vice president of strategy, customer insights and digital experience at Sally Beauty Holdings, said in a statement. Michelle Obama, Steph Curry partner to launch Plezi Hydration Plezi Nutrition, the company co-founded by former First Lady Michelle Obama, announced this week that it teamed up with NBA star Steph Curry to create a healthier sports hydration drink. "I'm excited to team up with Plezi to launch Plezii Hydration, a game-changing hydration beverage that I believe can make a real difference for anyone looking to perform at their best," Curry said in a statement. "We've created something with smart ingredients and unbeatable flavor, so people can fuel their bodies the right way. No nonsense, no shortcuts — because the next generation deserves better." Plezi said the beverage touts qualities like two-times the electrolytes, half the sugar, seven-times the potassium and less sodium compared to other sports drinks. The beverage comes in three flavors — lemon lime, tropical punch and orange mango twist — and is available in 16.9-ounce bottles for $2.29. The product is available nationwide on Amazon, as well as in California at Walmart, Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions locations. “At Plezi, we're always thinking about how we can change the game when it comes to nutrition," Obama said in a statement. “We're excited to provide a delicious, healthier option for everyone who's trying to get active and stay hydrated." 7-Eleven reintroduces an April Fool’s Day sweet treat 7-Eleven’s Mystery Donut for April Fool’s Day is returning for a limited time. The Bismark-style donut features an unknown flavor filling. Customers can take their guess at the Mystery Donut flavor at participating 7-Eleven, Speedway and Stripes locations from Tuesday through April 29. "Every April, we like to add a little mischief to our bakery offerings with the Mystery Donut as an unexpected twist that's all about surprising our customers in the spirit of April Fool's Day," Brandon Brown, senior vice president of Fresh Foods at 7-Eleven, said in a statement. "It may seem like a prank, but it's no joke!” $268,553 That’s how much GameStop paid to provide executive security services for CEO Ryan Cohen for the fiscal year ending on Feb. 1. “We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, as they enable Mr. Cohen to carry out his responsibilities,” the company wrote in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop doesn’t consider the securities to be a personal benefit or compensation paid to Cohen. 120 That’s how many employees Mattel will lay off at its headquarters, according to a March 17 notice filed in California in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The permanent layoffs are effective on May 19. Mattel did not immediately respond to Retail Dive’s requests for comment. The company said last year it was targeting $200 million in cost savings by 2026. Retailers face prolonged stretch of downbeat consumer sentiment The Conference Board said this week that its measure of consumer expectations for employment, business conditions and personal finance fell to its lowest point in 12 years and uncomfortably below the threshold that can signal a recession. Its measure of consumers’ confidence in the economy fell for the fourth straight month. This tracks with other research, including last week’s University of Michigan’s monthly consumer survey, which one economist called “a horrific report.” Much of the anxiety is fueled by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which announced auto levies earlier this week. “If there was a silver lining in [The Conference Board’s] March report, it was that consumer perceptions of the labor market held steady relative to February,” Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Jeremiah Koh said in a research note this week. “Even so, an overall theme of uncertainty is broadly setting in for the consumer, and the short term policy outlook does not portend an end to this uncertainty with new tariffs on the horizon in April.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Each year brings unique headwinds and tailwinds.

Title: International Insider: ‘No Other Land’; Series Mania Wraps; BAFTA TV Noms

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, Max Goldbart here taking you through another super busy week of news. Sign up here. ‘No Other Land‘ American Film Academy criticism: On Monday, Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham wrote in an X post that his Palestinian No Other Land co-director, Hamdan Ballal, had been attacked by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and was later detained by Israeli soldiers. The story has since moved fast. Abraham posted the next day that Ballal had been freed but was badly beaten while in custody. The 24-hour incident then sparked outcry in the film community, with strong statements from institutions including the European Film Academy. Filmmakers and actors such as Christine Vachon, Ezra Edelman, and Mark Ruffalo lent their names to public calls for Ballal’s release. The incident occurred less than a month after No Other Land won the Best Documentary Oscar, a grim fact that Abraham highlighted as he criticized the American Film Academy for “declining to publicly support” Ballal. The Academy did later send a letter to its members alluding to the incident, which Abraham posted on X and criticized for not mentioning Ballal. The American Academy rarely makes public statements about detentions or instances of violence against Academy winners, but in 2011, it did call for the release of multiple detained Iranian filmmakers, we have noted. The Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Police have denied being involved in any beating. Israeli authorities have said that Ballal was detained along with several others on suspicion of throwing stones, damaging property, and compromising the security of the area. The incident is devastating and comes as global stakeholders once again try to bring about ceasefire for a conflict that has lasted nearly 18 months. Related Stories News Monica Dolan, The First Actress This Decade To Be Nommed For Two TV BAFTAs In One Year, Says Industry Is "Plagued By Fear" Documentary 'No Other Land' Directors Thank Academy Members For Coming To Defense Of Hamdan Ballal After Attack Series Mania Wraps Up Cautious optimism and star power: Another year down for European TV’s biggest get-together and Series Mania is now certainly very much established as such. Myself, Jesse and Stewart have spent the week in Lille taking the temperature of the global TV biz and seeing what people have to say. The vibe on the ground was cautious optimism, as creatives and producers embrace challenges with spirit. Check out our five takeaways dive deep into what people were discussing. The funding crisis in drama was front and center, although we found that this is very much not a “one size fits all” problem and some are experiencing it more acutely than others. Stewart also had a think about the future of the fest as it hits a crossroads – it has become so big now (we hear attendance this year was up 20%) that it feels as though it could comfortably swallow up the now-defunct Cannes-based MIPTV and beyond. At the same time, star power at Series Mania only rises, with the likes of Amanda Seyfried, Christina Hendricks and Pamela Adlon all out and about and seemingly having a whale of a time in northern France. What could be next for this buzzy festival? We’ll be keeping a close eye. All our coverage from the week can be found here. BAFTA Turns To Small Screen Reindeers & Horses: While the BBC will no doubt point to a 75-nom haul as evidence the corporation remains at the peak of its power, yesterday’s BAFTA TV Awards anno shone a light on a trio of the biggest British streaming hits. Baby Reindeer topped the charts with eight, followed closely by Apple TV+’s Slow Horses and Disney+’s Rivals, with big names like Gary Oldman, Jonathan Pryce (for the first time) and Richard Gadd being recognized from these shows. The noms come at a time when funding local British drama is getting harder and harder, and it was therefore satisfying to see ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office neck-and-neck with these splashy streamer hits. Speaking to us afterwards, BAFTA boss Jane Millichip warned of “choppy waters” if the drama affordability issues aren’t resolved. She also pointed out that the tonal barriers are breaking down between shows commissioned by the broadcasters and the streamers. This time next year, two Netflix breakouts that are currently tearing up the global charts yet feel very much like they could have found a home at a British broadcaster, Adolescence and Toxic Town, might be in with a shout for BAFTAs, Millichip suggested. Elsewhere, there were high-profile snubs in the form of The Day of the Jackal, Wolf Hall’s Mark Rylance and Prime Video receiving just one nomination, while there were happy surprises like the always popular Billie Piper being recognized for Netflix’s Scoop. Jake’s “snubs and surprises” deep dive can be viewed here. The awards take place May 11. Jennifer Salke Out Bond seals Jen’s fate: The first top exec change at a global streamer since 2020 happened overnight. Jennifer Salke is out over at Amazon MGM, although she will segue to a producer first-look deal at the same company. As there are already separate TV and film bosses at Amazon MGM, Salke will not be replaced, with Courtenay Valenti (film) and Vernon Sanders (TV) now reporting directly to Mike Hopkins. More restructuring is expected to follow and we are already hearing this could impact international, where Amazon has recently made layoffs and shuffled its pack. Salke’s legacy is mixed. Big hits including The Boys, Fallout and Mr. & Mrs. Smith have come during her tenure, but they have been relatively few and far between and have run concurrent with scrutiny over expensive projects like The Rings of Power and the Russos’ Citadel. Furthermore, Mike Fleming Junior writes that Salke’s “inability to mesh with the gatekeepers of the James Bond movies” might well have sealed her fate. “While her exit from the executive suites officially is being regarded as an exit by choice into a producing deal, sources in town say it is closer to a firing,” he writes. Ears to the ground over what comes next for Amazon. ‘Holy Cow’! A cheesy win: I wanted to drop what I was doing and do my best to stream Holy Cow immediately upon reading Melanie’s fab Global Breakout piece this week. Mel took us to France, where Holy Cow, the feature directorial debut of Louise Courvoisier, has drawn close to 1 million spectators locally. The movie follows a teenager raised in a farming community in the Eastern department of Jura who embarks on a mission to make a prize-winning wheel of Comté cheese in the face of a series of hard knocks. Sounds brie-liant to me. Mel writes that while Holy Cow may not seem like a crowd-pleaser or box office breakout on paper, it has managed to gross roughly $6.5M from a $2.1M (€2M) budget. The pic also won best first film at the French César awards. Check out the Breakout over here. The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: Simon Pegg movie Angels in the Asylum has stopped shooting indefinitely after running out of cash mid-way through production. 🌶️ Another: Kaley Cuoco is leading buzzy suspense TV drama Vanished alongside Sam Claflin, three-time Cesar winner Karin Viard and German actor Matthias Schweighöfer. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Our roving International Editor-At-Large brought news that Willem Dafoe has launched a program at Venice. ❌ Charged: Gérard Depardieu has been requested an 18-month suspended prison sentence following his sexual assault trial this week. 🤝 Done deal: Canada’s Bell Media has bought a majority stake in Leaving Neverland distributor Sphere Abacus. 🚪 Exiting: Fremantle Asia and Lat AM CEO Ganesh Rajaram, after 20 years. 🍿 Box office: Nancy broke the exclusive news that Pablo Larraín’s Maria has become the Chilean filmmaker’s highest grossing movie at the international box office. 💼 New job: September 5 co-producer Constanze Guttman has joined Leonine. ⛺ Fest latest: Glasgow Film Festival industry boss Samantha Andie Bennett chatted with Diana about a busy year. 👀 First footage: Of Stay Forte, which stars Judd Hirsch and Selma Blair as Israeli hostages who, after a desperate escape from the tunnel network in Gaza, tragically fall victim to friendly fire.

Title: Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight date confirmed
URL: https://www.celebitchy.com/915559/katy_perry_and_lauren_sanchezs_blue_origin_space_flight_date_confirmed/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T11:25:38Z

Hereâs a question Iâm sure plagues most brides: is it better to go into space before or after your wedding? So much goes into planning the big day, Iâd think a lot of people would opt for waiting to play astronaut until after. But Lauren SÃ¡nchez is not most people. When others say formal winter attire, Lauren hears uncovered bustier. So naturally the noted journalist, bestselling author, pilot, entrepreneur, philanthropist, chairperson, and future Mrs. Bezos, is going the other way (as in, away from Earth), and squeezing in an aerospace flight ahead of her nuptials. Fresh off of the confirmation this week that Lauren and Jeff are marrying in Venice this summer, Blue Origin (the groomâs company) has just announced their first all-woman space mission is set to blastoff on April 14. How do we know theyâre all set to launch? Because theyâve got the official mission patch graphic! Blue Origin is ready to send several superstars to space. The launch date for the upcoming flight, which will include Katy Perry, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyá» n, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn and Lauren SÃ¡nchez, was confirmed this week. New Shepardâs NS-31 11th human flight will be Monday, April 14. It will lift off from Launch Site One in West Texas. The New Shepard launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC. Additionally, Blue Origin released the NS-31 mission patch. Per the company, a few of the key symbols embedded include: The target star symbolizes Aisha Boweâs ambition for setting big goals, passion for STEM, and commitment to inspiring future generations. The scales of justice symbolize Amanda Nguyá» nâs efforts to advocate for civil rights, break barriers, and empower everyday people to create change. The shooting star microphone represents Gayle Kingâs commitment to sharing important stories with the world. The firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy. The film reel symbolizes Kerianne Flynnâs passion for filmmaking, storytelling, and crafting beautiful narratives. Flynn the Fly, the main character in Lauren SÃ¡nchezâs bestselling childrenâs book, The Fly Who Flew to Space, is along for the ride. The story is about overcoming adversity, inspiring kids with learning differences to pursue their dreams. [From Just Jared] Real talk: how likely is it that the designer of that mission patch got paid an astronomically higher fee than anyone makes at Amazon? Also, âThe firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy,â made me chuckle. Why not just say itâs a nod to her song?! Katy was recently confirmed to be on Lauren and Jeffâs wedding guest list, as was Gayle King. So my next question is: is New Shepard NS-31 the bachelorette party? If so, I hope the invites said, âWill be out of this world!â (I know, I know, Iâm hilarious.) In all seriousness, I hope the flight runs smoothly and safely, and that all women aboard make it back in time for the weddingâ¦ and the rest of their lives. The recent spate of layoffs at Blue Origin has me worried, which probably wonât go away until after this whole unnecessary joyride once in a lifetime experience is over. And on top of that, the takeoff is in West Texas, currently battling an entirely preventable measles outbreak. The world is so fun right now.

Um… anyway, I hope they all have a lovely time in space and come back in one piece. Reply Smart&Messy says: March 28, 2025 at 7:34 am No she can’t, not without lifting her chin up weirdly. Same as Demi Moore. Both had very overdone liplifts. I observed a similar strained chin movement with Kate Hudson in Running Point, but to a lesser extent. They all look the same when they try to eat, for example, when you actually need to close your lips sometimes. Try to lift your upper lip with a finger right under your nose and try to speak or close you mouth. So noticeable. Reply StillDouchesOfCambridge says: March 28, 2025 at 7:57 am Thereâs a weird little crooked gap on the top lip, but her hair seems so healthy & soft and her lashes look great. Hope the flight goes well. Reply Kebbie says: March 28, 2025 at 8:03 am Thatâs putting it mildly lol her upper lip is completely deformed Cherry says: March 28, 2025 at 7:26 am I so, so hate this. We get to watch this dumb nonsense and at the same time see our hard-earned basic rights and decades-long fight for equality being obliterated in the course of a few years. But sure, great.

Um… anyway, I hope they all have a lovely time in space and come back in one piece. No she can’t, not without lifting her chin up weirdly. Same as Demi Moore. Both had very overdone liplifts. I observed a similar strained chin movement with Kate Hudson in Running Point, but to a lesser extent. They all look the same when they try to eat, for example, when you actually need to close your lips sometimes. Try to lift your upper lip with a finger right under your nose and try to speak or close you mouth. So noticeable. Thereâs a weird little crooked gap on the top lip, but her hair seems so healthy & soft and her lashes look great. Hope the flight goes well. Thatâs putting it mildly lol her upper lip is completely deformed I so, so hate this. We get to watch this dumb nonsense and at the same time see our hard-earned basic rights and decades-long fight for equality being obliterated in the course of a few years. But sure, great.

Title: Rolling Consumer Boycotts Stalk Amazon, Target And Tesla
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dearbeawalker/2025/03/28/rolling-consumer-boycotts-stalk-amazon-target-and-tesla/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByDeArbea Walker ByDeArbea Walker Forbes Staff. Consumers are organizing "#TeslaTakedown" protests online to show their anger toward CEO Elon Musk. Consumer activists have launched rolling economic boycotts of Target, Amazon and other recognizable companies in recent weeks to protest DEI rollbacks and policies seemingly aimed at appeasing the Trump administration. The outcome of these campaigns hinges on how deeply the companies feel their effects and whether consumers can find suitable alternatives. The People's Union USA, a consumer advocacy group organizing many of the boycotts, has set its sights this week on Nestlé, for what the group's founder John Schwarz says is the company's failure to address allegations of toxic ingredients and unethical business practices. This action follows calls to boycott retailers Amazon and Target for rollbacks to their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Nestlé did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, anger toward the electric vehicle maker Tesla has boiled over as public antipathy toward its CEO, Elon Musk, seems to have grown since he became the Trump administration's chief cost-cutter. These consumer initiatives may indicate the start of a "Great Rejection," which is gaining momentum online to stop spending on nonessential goods, Greg Petro, Forbes Investing contributor, says. “Whether or not a recession is in the cards this year, the evidence is clear that frustration stalks the retail aisles,” Petro writes. Consumers don’t stop spending altogether during boycotts, opening up opportunities for small businesses to attract new customers looking for alternatives, Forbes entrepreneurs contributor Allyson Kapin writes. “Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection — a re-allocation — of spending power,” Kapin says. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Black and Latino consumer groups have avoided Target and Walmart, noting the retailers' announced rollbacks of their DEI policies late last year. During The People’s Union USA’s Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, Target saw a 9% drop in foot traffic and a 14% drop in web traffic, according to Similarweb. “For now, at least in the short term, it seems that these boycotts are having an effect, but the question is how long it will last,” Forbes contributor Doug Melville writes. Black activists are focusing on Target because they see the company's about-face on DEI frustrating after its outspokenness during the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020, Pam Danziger, a Forbes retail contributor writes. Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, had committed to purchasing $2 billion worth of goods from Black businesses by the end of 2025. And the retailer promised to increase its Black workforce by 20% and pledged to establish an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee. “Target seems to be particularly vulnerable,” Danziger writes, noting the company was seen as "a high-profile partner in the diversity, equity and inclusion movement, only to be perceived as abandoning the cause.” "We would expect some loyalty, some decency and some camaraderie,” Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and lead voice of the 40-day economic boycott, told CNN. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Target declined to comment but pointed Forbes to a statement it released in January, when it announced rollbacks of DEI initiatives. It reads in part: “We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion.” Target has been one of the most visible brands to raise the ire of consumer activists, and the retailer may face its biggest test this week when stores offer up to 40% off for Circle Week — slated to go head-to-head with Amazon’s Prime Week. Data from the sales "should be able to paint a better picture of these consumer efforts," Melville says. Amazon, which was the subject of a week-long boycott earlier this month, has shown some resilience, according to Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters. The e-commerce giant saw a 6% uptick in traffic from the previous eight weeks when The People’s Union USA boycotted March 7 to 14, according to Momentum Commerce. Before the Amazon boycott, 9% of shoppers planned to participate, but when the time came, the data showed a different story, according to Masters. “The disparity between stated boycott intentions and sales impact underscores a well-documented gap between what consumers say they’ll do and what they actually do,” Masters says. With consumers participating in a variety of boycotts and protests, small businesses wonder if there will be an opportunity for them to win customers. The grocery space offers some insights. Since 2020, consumer spending at farmers’ markets has increased more than 20%, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. Consumers seem to be gravitating to farmers' markets looking for more locally sourced and safer food options, Stephanie Gravalese, a Forbes dining contributor writes. “If the blackout encourages even a fraction of participants to shift toward local alternatives, it could reinforce an existing movement prioritizing small food businesses over corporate chains — a shift that may already be underway,” Gravalese writes. However, while consumers look for non-corporate options for everyday goods, many fear a complete drop-off in consumer spending in response to the boycotts. Inflation, perhaps stiffened by tariffs, and uncertainty over the future of the labor market have left consumers feeling uneasy. Last month, consumer confidence dropped seven points to its lowest level since 2021, according to The Conference Board, a nonpartisan think tank. “While the Great Rejection is not a real thing yet, it is an idea that consumers are warming to — spend less and save more — that could be with us for some time to come,” Petro writes. Even with boycotts planned through the summer, Shelley Kohan, a Forbes retail contributor, writes that the biggest question is how can consumers voice their fury without tanking the economy. While the boycotts aim “to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake,” Kohan says. Tesla sales have been down worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Europe. It's not just DEI cuts that have some consumers upset. The #Teslatakedown social media campaign targets Tesla, one of the largest and most recognizable electric car makers, led by Musk. “Every action he makes is met with an equal reaction online, often with the hashtag,” Peter Suciu, a Forbes social media contributor writes of Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man and the CEO of SpaceX, Starlink, X and Tesla, has been one of the most visible and prolific fundraisers and supporters of President Trump and backed far-right political parties in the U.K. and Germany. With Trump's blessing, Musk has overseen mass layoffs and spending cuts across the federal government in his role as head of the Department Of Government Efficiency. Musk has defended DOGE, saying that the project, aimed at cutting up to $2 trillion in government money, is addressing what he sees as widespread fraud in federal spending. However, Musk has been met with fierce backlash from the public, especially as he’s turned his attention to popular programs like Medicaid and Social Security. “Stealing from Social Security is not easy,” Forbes senior contributor Howard Gleckman writes. “The agency tracks employment and payroll tax payments for all workers with a Social Security number and automatically calculates old age benefits. It is very hard to game that system.” “The real risk," Gleckman says: "Trump Administration efforts to fire thousands of Social Security employees will reduce their ability to catch fraud.” Consumer dissatisfaction with Musk has already slowed Tesla's growth. Since late last year, sales have decreased worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Germany — down 76%. The company's share price has also fallen 43% since Inauguration Day, and more than $650 billion has been wiped from the company's valuation. Musk's fortune has shrunk $104 billion, according to Forbes' wealth estimates. “There are several reasons for Tesla's poor results, such as the changeover of the Model Y, falling Model 3 sales and stronger competition from rival EVs," Peter Lyon, a Forbes cars and bikes contributor writes. "Industry analysts have also put some blame for Tesla’s slump in Germany on local dissent at Musk's interference in local elections and support of the far-right AfD party.” Protests against Musk and Tesla have taken different forms: While some Tesla owners have joined consumer activism efforts by trading in their vehicles, other protests have included vandalism. How much retailers will feel the effects of consumer boycotts is still unknown, and whether or not shoppers will find lasting alternatives to the retail giants remains to be seen. “Given the increasing political divide in the country, politics is infiltrating many non-political dimensions of life, like shopping,” Danziger says. The key for retailers, big and small, may be to proceed cautiously. Kapin points out that small businesses may have opportunities while shoppers are frustrated with the big retailers. But in some ways, all retailers’ prospects are linked. “The tension between consumer activism and economic reality sits at the heart of this economic blackout debate,” Kohan writes. “While The People’s Union USA’s campaign aims to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake.”

Title: Tech has a new power base in DC

Time Published: 2025-03-28T09:00:01Z

Washington, DC, investors have long hoped to make the capital a tech startup hub. In Trump's second term, those ambitions are finally taking hold. The new presidential administration has brought a number of Silicon Valley heavyweights to Washinton. Big names in tech and venture capital like Tesla's Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz's Scott Kupor now hold positions in the federal government, while other Big Tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are spending more time in Washington, hoping to exert their influence on new tech policies. Washington is already seeing rising VC interest — the top-tier venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst have opened offices in the area in the past year, and hot defense tech startups with significant DC footprints, such as Anduril, are landing more checks and contracts. Just last week, A16z hosted an "American Dynamism" conference in Washington, with opening remarks by Vice President JD Vance. "It's time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests of the United States of America writ large," Vance said at the summit. Now, Washington is welcoming a wave of tech elites, many with backgrounds in startups and VC, that are "startup curious," said James Barlia, the executive director of the startup incubator Station DC. "There's a new power base that's forming in DC, and it's creating a real opportunity for founders," he said. Paige Soya, a managing partner at K St Capital, a local VC firm and angel syndicate, said the arrival of the tech aristocracy, along with other affluent officials in Trump's administration, is driving a real estate rush for luxury multimillion-dollar properties in the district — and bringing the potential for those elites to angel invest in local startups. "A lot of these people would have never thought of DC as a place to find good deals. But because they're here, they're organically starting to see it. I think that's going to impact funding on its own," she said. Barlia is optimistic that tech's elevated presence in the district will do more than bring money to the DC startup community: It could inject Washington with a dose of Silicon Valley's culture of disruption. "I feel like there's now deeper connectivity between Silicon Valley and DC, including ideologically and philosophically," he said. In the past year, as AI took over Silicon Valley and Trump effused a pro-tech, anti-AI-regulation stance during his presidential campaign, several powerful VCs emerged to support Trump's administration. Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Founder's Fund, posted on X after Trump chose Vance as his running mate, '"IT'S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY." Their exuberance brings new momentum to DC's tech ecosystem, which has been steadily growing as startups seek government contracts and influence on Capitol Hill. The district now boasts the fifth-most-developed VC ecosystem in the US, according to PitchBook, despite being the country's 23rd-largest city, per 2022 Census data. Tech giants like Palantir, which runs an office in Georgetown, and Microsoft, which has offices in Washington's Mt. Vernon Square and across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, have helped draw in tech and investment talent over time. Now, VC firms like A16z and General Catalyst aren't the only ones interested in the DMV's startup scene — the district itself is now betting on area startups. Mayor Muriel Bowser launched DC's first Venture Capital Program in December, with $26 million to invest in early-stage DC startups. Soya's K St Capital was picked to manage the funds. Every dollar of public funding has to be matched by private funding, Soya noted, so DC startups could receive up to $52 million through the program. K St Capital has been building its DC firm for over a decade alongside other early-stage investors such as Saas Ventures, founded in 2017. Newer projects such as District Angels launched last year to pool local angel investors to back DC startups. However, while the Trump administration has forged a newfound alliance with the tech industry, the Department of Government Efficiency's slew of cuts to federal agencies could threaten the industry's growth in Washinton. The district's chief financial officer has estimated that the layoffs could cost DC more than 40,000 jobs over the next four years. But Barlia said he thinks Elon Musk's much-criticized push to "trim the fat" in the federal government will make Washington stronger. "Elon's approach may make some people uncomfortable, but the underlying problem is undeniable. Yes, there's near-term disruption — RIFs and potential economic contraction — but in the long run, it should push DC to build a more resilient, opportunity-rich economy," he said. "That won't come from more government or big corporate jobs, but by embracing new ideas, startups, and innovation." Washington is, first and foremost, a government town, with an inherent federal bureaucracy that's at odds with many startups' "move fast and break things" ethos, said John Doyle, a former Palantir executive and the founder of the defense startup Cape. Still, Doyle and Barlia said they're seeing interest from federal agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, to work with startups and move fast — faster than is typical of the government, at least. Chris Morales, a Point72 Ventures defense tech partner who's based in DC, pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's March memo about the DoD's plans to modernize how it acquires software and contracts with companies. Morales said the memo is one of multiple signs his firm is seeing that the agency is getting more serious about tech innovation. While Soya and Barlia said they're seeing startups across various industries gain traction in Washington, defense tech easily remains the hottest among them. Cape landed its first contract with the Department of Defense in 2023 in a deal to provide its cybersecurity-focused mobile carrier services to Naval forces in Guam after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group targeted the base's tech infrastructure. Cape has since raised $61 million in financing rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz and A*, announced in April 2024. Doyle said part of the reason Cape picked DC as its headquarters was to rub shoulders with the federal agencies it hoped to partner with. As he said, "proximity matters." It's no surprise then that a number of defense tech startups have opened offices in Washington, including Anduril, which recently raised $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation in August, and Shield AI, which raised $240 million this month in a funding round that valued the autonomous drone maker at $5.3 billion. Startups in the DMV can also tap into the area's hard tech talent, which could help continue to boost the area's presence as a tech hub. Northern Virginia hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of data centers. Amazon opened its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, in 2023. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, have outposts in the area. And many of the country's largest aerospace and defense companies, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are headquartered in the DMV. Doyle said the DMV's deep bench of technical expertise has helped Cape find numerous backend engineers in the area. He admitted, though, that Washington has a smaller candidate pool than traditional tech hubs like San Francisco and New York City. Cape also has a New York office, for which Doyle said it's generally easier to source talent, especially front-end engineers and designers. As some VCs flock to the DC area, others are fleeing. Sequoia Capital plans to shutter its DC office at the end of March and cut its policy team there, despite other major VC firms moving in. A Sequoia spokesperson told BI that the firm built its policy team in DC to strengthen its connections and its portfolio companies' connections with policymakers and other experts. The policy team set Sequoia up favorably to carry those relationships forward in the US and Europe, the spokesperson said. Khosla Ventures managing director Keith Rabois said at a conference in February that Washington "definitely still is not where early-stage venture capitalists should be spending too much time," despite saying he'd recently run into Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the city. DC's venture scene may not yet rival San Francisco's, but it's feeling fresh momentum nonetheless. A16z's American Dynamism Summit largely set out to connect San Francisco's VC ecosystem with Washington policymakers, but DC-based investors were also in attendance this year, said Jonathan Lacoste, a general partner at Austin-based Space VC, who attended the conference. "There were plenty of investors at the event, not just from the West Coast, but increasingly from DC's venture landscape too," he told BI. As DC's tech community grows, so does its appetite for more networking opportunities. Catherine McMillan, an analyst at the tech-focused consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, founded the DC chapter of the GenAI Collective, a generative AI networking nonprofit started in San Francisco in 2023. McMillan also helps run two other tech communities in the district: DC Tech Parties and She's In Tech. McMillan's DC chapter of the GenAI collective now has 700 members, with each event bringing in fresh faces. "It's an undervalued tech market because it doesn't have the same level of visibility that SF or New York have. That's part of what I'm trying to do, shed a light on the cool entrepreneurial things that are happening in the DMV," she said. "We have a Big Tech presence, but we also have an ecosystem in its own right." Jump to

Title: A millennial making $280,000 secretly working 2 remote jobs said it's important to get in a rhythm: 'Burnout is real'

After getting laid off four times in four years, Reed was desperate for some level of job security. So he decided to try working two full-time jobs simultaneously. In March 2020, Reed, who's in his 30s and living in New York, was laid off from his strategic operations job in the tech industry. It took him six months to start a new job, but layoffs struck again. His next job lasted less than a month because of the company's financial hardships. By December 2023, he'd lost his fourth job in just over three years. "It was easy to get the jobs because there were jobs out there, but it was hard to keep them," said Reed, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing a fear of professional repercussions. From 2020 to 2023, more than 800,000 tech industry employees across the globe were laid off, according to TrueUp's layoff tracker. Reed said that after the fourth layoff, he had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. This year, Reed is on track to earn about $280,000 secretly working two full-time remote jobs, which pay about $175,000 and $150,000 respectively. With the additional income, he said, he supports his partner — who has been unemployed for three years — helps his parents pay their monthly mortgage, and assists his niece and nephew with their college tuition. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner so we can stay in our apartment and still save money, and do all those adult things that I'm responsible for financially," he said. "I don't really have a choice." Reed is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple remote jobs to boost their incomes. Over the past two years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra earnings to travel the world, buy weight-loss drugs, or simply pay the bills. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. But many job jugglers have told BI the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. After his fourth layoff, Reed started applying for remote jobs, intending to accept two full-time offers if he could get them. In March 2024, he landed his first job. He said looking for another role — between all the applications and interviews — sometimes felt like a second job. In December, he finally achieved his goal and began job juggling for the first time. During his job search, Reed tried to prioritize employers that seemed committed to remote work, but this didn't always go according to plan. Around early September of last year, Reed finished the interview process for a remote position at Amazon. But soon after he'd finished interviewing, Amazon announced that many corporate employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in January. When Reed received a job offer for the role, it was no longer remote: He'd be required to work full time from the nearest office, which he said was about 30 to 40 minutes away. He decided to decline the offer and, in December, accepted a remote position with another company. While other companies have also announced return-to-office policies, Reed feels confident his two current jobs will remain remote. To his knowledge, neither company has ever had a mandatory in-office policy. Reed's typical workweek is about 60 hours, he said, but he does some of his work in the evenings and on weekends. He said that while juggling two jobs could be very stressful at times, he'd found some ways to manage this stress. He gets up earlier than he needs to so he can prepare for the workday ahead, but he still makes sure to get enough sleep — he said it's easier to manage stress when he's well-rested. Additionally, rather than switching between his two work laptops every few minutes, Reed tries to focus on one job for an extended period of time before pivoting to the other. "I have to take breaks in the middle of the day to be able to decipher between one of the two jobs because it does get a little overwhelming," he said. Reed said he has an advantage that many job jugglers don't have: He generally doesn't have to worry about having two meetings scheduled at the same time. That's because he usually schedules the meetings he has to attend. He said he blocks off his meeting times for one job on the other job's calendar, which helps him reduce his chances of getting double-booked. "It has been way more manageable than I thought it was going to be," he said of job juggling. "If you can get into a rhythm of how it works and get organized with how you do the work, it's totally possible to do." Reed said that over the past couple of years, it had taken him longer to land job offers. He thinks this is because many of the remote roles he's applied for have hundreds of applicants — and the interview process has become more extensive. "I used to be able to do two, three interviews max and you would get an offer," he said. "Now it's like a hiring screen, a take-home test, a panel, you have to do a presentation — there are like six or seven steps." Looking ahead, Reed said he had no plans to stop job juggling. He doesn't think it's sustainable long-term, but with his partner still looking for work, he can't afford to stop now. "For now, I'm giving myself a three-to-five-year window," he said. "Because burnout is real. It's going to happen eventually." ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Title: 'MBA is costliest course for teaching nothing': Consultant drops a brutal truth bomb

Feedback A senior manager at a consultancy firm, Manab Majumdar, dropped a provocative reality check about MBAs, stirring significant debate on LinkedIn: "MBA is the costliest course for teaching nothing. Yes, you can learn every subject taught in an MBA at 1/100 cost." The blunt assessment arrives amidst a rapidly shifting job market where traditional assumptions about MBA programs are being dismantled. Majumdar didn't stop there, adding, "Post MBA, you don't become the CXO of the company. Bollywood ka movie dekh k MBA wala fantasy jo hain, wo galat hain." Indeed, dreams of instant executive roles after graduation are increasingly proving unrealistic. CA Nitin Kaushik (@Finance_Bareek) on X echoed this sentiment sharply: "𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling." Even premier institutions like Harvard aren't insulated. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted an unsettling statistic: 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 graduates were unemployed three months after graduation, a dramatic increase from 10% just two years earlier. Stanford and Wharton, too, have reported similar declines, with unemployment nearing 20%. Globally, the picture isn't brighter. According to the International Labour Organization, youth unemployment stood at an alarming 13% in 2023, affecting approximately 65 million young individuals worldwide. Why are MBAs struggling despite attractive median starting salaries exceeding $175,000? The answer lies partly in evolving corporate strategies. Firms like McKinsey, BCG, Google, and Amazon have sharply curtailed MBA hiring amid economic downturns and layoffs. Simultaneously, the corporate world is shifting toward smaller, specialized teams, boosted by the rise of AI and automation, making generalized MBA skills less relevant. Kristen Fitzpatrick, head of career development at Harvard Business School, starkly observes, "Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator." Instead, specialized technical skills are increasingly coveted. In response, business schools are pivoting rapidly. Harvard is now experimenting with AI-powered tools designed to match students to jobs and suggest tailored courses to bridge skills gaps. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.
