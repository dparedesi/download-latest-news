AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

Title: Microsoft layoffs: Perfect Dark VA says she recorded “entire chapters” before Xbox canceled reboot

New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. I’m guessing OP didn’t get a new car as a gift, so… got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a “free turkey” around the holidays. It wasn’t really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didn’t cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurant’s “signature” steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. We’ve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat ‘for the company’. We didn’t get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users.

Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent.

Title: I was laid off by Oracle 2 years ago and still can't find a job. I've blown through my savings and now sell antiques to stay afloat.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to

Title: Job seekers in 2025 faced a Great Frustration: never-ending applications, ghosting after interviews, and losing hope

Call it the Great Freeze — or the Great Frustration. Business Insider spoke with dozens of job seekers across generations in 2025, some of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. They voiced a wide range of frustrations about their searches — including slow hiring timelines, so-called "ghost jobs," suspected ageism, employers going silent midway through the process, overwhelming competition for each role, and the belief that AI filters are often screening their résumés before a human ever sees them. Their job-finding journeys come at a time when employers are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. Whether the job seekers blame AI, corporate efficiency pushes, or broader economic uncertainty, they say it all adds up to a deluge of applications and a dearth of job offers. Still, through the frustration, they've also found ways to cope and connect with a community of fellow job seekers. "I believe the hiring system is broken," said Matthew English, who's been looking for full-time work since October 2024 after a decadeslong career in accounting. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs — from accounting roles to the Chick-fil-A cow mascot — he's been unable to secure a full-time offer. He said he's burned through much of his savings, and that last Christmas, he couldn't afford to buy gifts for his family. "I have about drained my life's savings," said English, who is in his 60s and lives in Alabama. "Money that you're expecting to use in retirement is now being used to survive." The New York Fed regularly asks people to estimate the likelihood that, if they lost their job today, they'd be able to find a new one in the next three months. In August 2025, that average probability dropped to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013 — and has only recovered slightly in the months since. Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said 2025's labor market had "low momentum." "The cumulative effect of three years of slowdown — it's completely understandable why they feel like this might be the worst labor market they've ever been in," Kantenga said. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by emailing jzinkula@businessinsider.com or mhoff@businessinsider.com. Read more on the topic: Hilary Nordland began looking for work after being laid off from her marketing role in July 2024. To help pay the bills, she said she started donating plasma and drew on her retirement savings. Nordland, who's in her 50s and lives in Minnesota, said one of the most frustrating parts of her job search has been landing interviews — only to have opportunities fall through for unexpected reasons. She said she's had interviews canceled the same day they were scheduled because the role was suddenly put on hold or filled internally. On one occasion, she said, an HR representative told her she'd be a great fit — but the rep was fired before they could schedule the interview. "This job market is terrifying," she said. "It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through." US employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts so far in 2025, the most since 2020. While the unemployment rate remains relatively low by historical standards, it has risen to its highest level since 2021, when the economy was still recovering from pandemic-related disruptions. High demand for jobs — combined with the rise of AI-assisted applications — has contributed to an influx of submissions for open roles, making it harder for qualified candidates to stand out. Last quarter, the average job posting received 242 applications, nearly three times the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. Aaron Terrazas, an independent economist, said job seekers' frustration with this year's labor market was justified. "Just because the aggregate jobs data look stable, steady, slowing but stable, doesn't mean that it hasn't been very difficult for some people," Terrazas said. Heather Driscoll began looking for a healthcare management job after being laid off last year. She said she's struggled to pay the bills and had to draw on her 401(k). "The amount of time, research, enthusiasm — the dressing up, hair, makeup — just to sit on a Zoom call and get no feedback or rejection, is insane," she said. Driscoll, who's in her 50s and lives in Colorado, said she has reached the final interview round multiple times but has been unable to secure an offer. She suspects that ageism and sexism could be working against her. A challenging job market has forced some job seekers to confront the possibility that their goals and aspirations may be out of reach. At age 40, Kenneth Ferraro quit his job as a truck driver to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science at New York University. He hoped it would set him up for a career in public service — but after struggling to find work, he returned to trucking last year. He said he's stuck with more than $100,000 in student debt. While having a college degree improved his credentials, Ferraro said he thought his age had held him back in the job market. He recalled applying for an entry-level government position that seemed like a good fit. The early stages of the interview process felt promising, but he said things shifted after the in-person interview — and he suspects his age was a factor. "As soon as the hiring manager saw me, his whole demeanor changed," Ferraro said. "He ran through the questions and never truly engaged with me." Solomon Jones hoped that earning a college degree would open doors. After earning his bachelor's degree in sports communication in May, he struggled to find employment. Jones said that some of the sports communications job postings he'd come across had attracted more than 1,000 applicants. "The goal is to obviously get a job in the sports industry, but realistically, I know that life isn't fair," said Jones, who's in his 20s and lives in New Jersey. "So at this point, I'm just trying to find a job, period." Some job seekers Business Insider spoke with have leaned on others — including friends, family, professional contacts, and fellow job seekers — for support and solidarity during their job searches. After being laid off by Microsoft in May, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment, but eventually moved to Florida to save money by living with family while continuing his search. Carter said he's connected with others who've lost their jobs and visits the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout Microsoft's history. "Layoffs kind of affect people mentally," said Carter, who's in his 30s. "I've reached out to people so we can be each other's support system." In July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off by Intel for the second time. On his last official day with the company, his wife also lost her job. When he learned the news, his mindset shifted from "I'll find a job when I can" to "I'd better find a job." But over the past few months, he's struggled to make much headway. Ramkrishna said one of the things keeping him going is the support of his former Intel colleagues, who also lost their jobs. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said uncertainty helped drive this year's low-fire, low-hire job market, such as businesses navigating the effects of tariffs and AI. Terrazas, the independent economist, doesn't think uncertainty will fully fade next year, but said employers won't be facing the initial shock of policy changes from a new administration. Most job seekers can't afford to put their searches on hold until conditions improve. Despite the challenges, some have managed to break through. When Alexander Valen was laid off from his project manager role at Accenture, he was initially optimistic that his more than two decades of experience would help him land a new job. But after nearly two years of job searching — and falling behind on his mortgage — that optimism had vanished. Valen, who's in his 50s and lives in Florida, said he and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and help from family to get by. But a few months ago, someone in his network recommended he explore roles at the freelance platform Toptal. Valen applied for a project manager role, went through the interview process, and landed the position, which he said fell within the $80 to $100 an hour compensation range he'd been targeting. Valen's top advice for other job seekers: Reframe how you view the process — and lean on others along the way. "The search becomes far less discouraging when you treat it as an opportunity to grow rather than a verdict on your worth," he said. "And in a market this competitive, networking isn't optional — it's the force multiplier that ultimately led me to my role." Jump to

Title: Pick up 2025's most underrated RPG during the Steam Winter Sale

There's certainly no shortage of choice when it comes to what to buy during the Steam Winter Sale. Hundreds, if not thousands, of games are available for cheaper than ever before. While the Featured Deep Discounts and sales for some of the biggest games of the year are worth looking at, the Steam Winter Sale is also a great time to get some of 2025's most underrated games. Specifically, for fans of tabletop role-playing games and games that explore the different ways we interact with the medium, I'd highly recommend Secret Door and Dreamhaven's Sunderfolk. Typically $50, Sunderfolk is discounted by 40% to just $30 during this Steam Winter Sale. If you're willing to use your phone to control a tactics RPG with some friends, you'll discover one of the most underrated games of the year. In 2020, former Activision Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime founded Dreamhaven, a new game publisher and parent company to multiple development studios. Sunderfolk was the first internally developed game that they released, and it was quite the bold swing for a first game. It's a cooperative, turn-based tactical RPG meant to be a digital replacement for your tabletop board game night. In it, you play as cute animals who fit classic RPG archetypes like tank, warrior, and mage, and go on missions with your friends to save the home village of Arden. I personally like playing as the Pyromancer, a salamander that powers up by stepping into the fire his attacks leave behind on tiles. Actress Anjali Bhimani also put in impressive work for Sunderfolk, voicing every single character and the narrator in the game. The one catch, if you want to call it that, in all of this is that you have to use an app on your phone to control your character in Sunderfolk. Your on-screen cursor movement, move selection, and character upgrades between missions are all handled from a smartphone screen. That may sound gimmicky and off-putting to some, but buy in and you'll actually find this setup feels surprisingly intuitive. Mechanically, it's an impressive tactics game, with varied mission objectives, unique player abilities, and creative ways for players to interact and assist one another. If you can wrangle up a group of friends to play the game (only one copy is required), it truly offers some of the most fun of any multiplayer game released in 2025. It's even possible to play it alone, although that's not ideal. Regardless, Sunderfolk is an incredibly charming game that I wish more people knew about. While I really enjoy Sunderfolk and its Jackbox-meets-D&D approach to multiplayer RPG gaming, it was not an overnight success for Dreamhaven following its launch in April of this year. According to a Bloomberg report, it sold only about 62,000 copies in its first four months on the market. Its Android app has 100,000+ downloads. Layoffs did occur at Dreamhaven in August. I credit Sunderfolk's underperformance to a couple of different factors. First, it's hard to convince hardcore RPG video game fans to adopt such a complex way to play a new RPG due to the stigma surrounding mobile games. Meanwhile, tabletop gamers chose to stick with their physical games. It also didn't help that Sunderfolk launched on April 23, the same week The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. As players had two fantastic RPGs, capitalizing on nostalgia to choose from, something as experimental as Sunderfolk didn't capture players' attention like those titles did. This game is at its best when multiple people are convinced to play it over an extended period of time. The time and interest buy-in required, and the release timing, just didn't work in Sunderfolk's favor. That makes a quiet late December for new game releases the perfect time to release it. To Secret Door and Dreamhaven's credit, they also haven't abandoned the game. Its app is still operational, and a free trial for those curious but not convinced is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. A post-launch update added the ability to do one-shot missions rather than a whole campaign, while an update next year is set to add a new playable character, more missions, and even the ability to play the game with mouse and keyboard rather than a phone. That support gives me the confidence to recommend Sunderfolk at its current 40% discount. If you missed out on Sunderfolk around the time it was released, it's worth picking up now that it's just $30 during the Steam Winter Sale. For those who are still skeptical of using a phone as a controller, I recommend trying the free trial first; you'll come away impressed. You could also wait to play it until keyboard and mouse controls are added next year, but still buy it at a discount now. So many games fall through the cracks of the gaming zeitgeist every year, and Sunderfolk is one that deserves another chance. While throwback RPGs are comfort food, something like Sunderfolk is innovating the ways that keep the genre interesting. Phone interesting may not catch on outside of Netflix or Amazon Luna's casual games, but some other game design ideas from this game can live on in future RPGs. $30 is more than worth it if you want to play a game that's trying something new and not just iterating on the same old concepts.

Title: A major overhaul of League of Legends is reportedly coming in 2027: 'Once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League'

Riot has big plans for attracting new players to its aging MOBA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new Bloomberg report says Riot Games is currently working on an update to League of Legends, known internally as League Next, that will be the biggest in the game's history. The overhaul of League's "visual aesthetic," as Bloomberg put it, will impact characters, battle arenas, and the interface, and is aimed at making the game more welcoming for new players. League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in. The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios. The games that emerged from that program, including Ruined King, Mageseeker, Bandle Tale, Song of Nunu, and Convergence, were generally well received but failed to attract significant audiences. Another round of layoffs at Riot followed in October, as Riot co-founder Marc Merrill indicated that the studio was looking back to its foundational MOBA for future success. "This isn't about reducing headcount to save money," Merrill said at the time. "It's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond. While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League." After the Bloomberg report went out, Riot posted a video that didn't exactly deny what was in it. Pointedly entitled "A look at some of our plans for League after 2026," the video has executive producer Paul "Pabro" Bellezza and head of studio Andrei "Meddler" van Roon acknowledging that the studio has "been working on some bigger updates to League." A look at some of our plans for League after 2026. pic.twitter.com/vqsnBksg1YDecember 18, 2025 "For starters, we're making a brand-new around-game client that's fully integrated with the in-game experience, rather than being a separate application like today," van Roon says. Bellezza then jumps in to say, "We're also revamping Summoner's Rift with entirely new visuals, and a bit of new gameplay," and then adds, pointedly, that Riot is "overhauling the new player experience, so that once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It definitely isn't a comprehensive look at what's coming in some post-2026 timeframe, but it does sound very much like it will be very big indeed. Whether it succeeds in attracting new players to League, or merely annoys the existing old-timers, is an entirely separate question, and the irony is that Riot's co-domination of the MOBA space, alongside Valve's Dota 2, has made life extremely difficult for newcomers. Supervive, developed by a team of Riot veterans and released just five months ago, announced earlier this week that it will close down in February; Seekers of Skyveil had an even shorter lifespan, Gigantic: Rampage Edition has literally zero players on Steam, and Amazon recently opted to sell March of Giants to Ubisoft rather than release it. League of Legends may be aging out, but whether there's an appetite for some kind of 'League 2.0' remains to be seen. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Games industry layoff figures were down slightly in 2025 – but it was still horrendous | Year in Review

Although layoffs were down by around a third, studios in the US and Western Europe may have been hit by the trend for jobs moving to emerging markets Conditions remain tough in the games industry, and layoff figures were still high in 2025, although down from their peak in 2024. Amir Satvat, business development director at Tencent Games, maintains a widely used resource for helping people find jobs in the games industry, and for the past few years he has been tracking and forecasting layoff numbers. Crucially, he attempts to include layoffs that were not publicly reported, as well as using his community connections to find out actual figures for layoffs when companies report them without listing the numbers of people affected. At the time of writing, Satvat has settled on a figure of 9,175 games industry layoffs in 2025, just shy of the prediction of 9,769 he made back in January. That's dramatically down on the estimated 15,631 layoffs in 2024, although still higher than the estimated 8,500 layoffs in 2022, when the current games industry crisis kicked in. Satvat predicts that we'll see another 7,500 layoffs in 2026, pointing towards a slow recovery in the industry. However, he thinks that the share of open roles in North America and Western Europe will continue to decrease. Earlier this year, he told The Games Business that "over 70%, and in some years 75%, of the layoffs have been in North America," with AAA studios being particularly affected, and with more than 50% of cuts taking place in California. Similarly, a survey released in October found more than 26% of European game professionals were laid off in the past year, with median salaries dropping dramatically compared with 2024. "Salaries for programmers – especially Unity developers – have dropped by almost half, mainly because there are barely any open positions," said Tanja Loktionova, founder of Values Value and co-founder of InGame Job, the companies behind the survey. "There have been a lot of layoffs and very few new opportunities." Satvat predicts that whereas job opportunities will decrease in Western Europe and North America, they will increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. That tallies with comments made during this year's GamesIndustry.biz Investment Panel by Lirui Ding, principal at the gaming venture capital firm Transcend Fund, about the games industry's ongoing geographical shift. "We're really seeing a lot of money actually going from the US and Europe to other emerging markets," he explained, "whether it's China, Turkey, or even Vietnam." Chris Petrovic, chief business officer and board chairman at the developer and publisher FunPlus, made similar comments in a GamesIndustry.biz feature in December, where he predicted that the industry would grow, but in different areas of the globe. "Previously, we talked a lot about gaming innovation, creativity, and commercial success coming from places like the United States, Canada, Germany, and Finland," he said, "and now we are increasingly talking about emerging game dev hubs like China, Turkey, Israel, and Vietnam." 2025 saw a number of studio closures, including Toadman Interactive, Freejam, nDreams Studio Orbital and nDreams Studio, Thunderful-owned Studio Fizbin, Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop Studios, Zynga-owned Echtra Games, Dundee-based Cobra Mobile, Microsoft-owned The Initiative, Avalanche Studios Group's Liverpool studio, Ubisoft Leamington, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, Fantastic Pixel Castle, Bad Brain Game Studios, and three Warner Bros. Games studios: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. Reports also alleged that Ballistic Moon, the UK-based developer of the Until Dawn remake, was "effectively closed" after almost all its staff were laid off, while Aheartfulofgames, the Spanish studio behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, said it faced closure after owner Outright Games signalled its intention to make all employees at the studio redundant. In addition, the UK-based studios Three Fields Entertainment and Splash Damage both began redundancy consultations affecting all employees. Dozens of studios cut staff numbers in 2025, including: In terms of the biggest gaming companies, Tencent Games made a number of cuts and divestments at its European studios. In February, the Tencent-owned Sumo Group announced it would be refocusing "exclusively on development services for partners," which would "have an impact on our studios and people." It sold off publisher Secret Mode in March. In June, Sumo-owned studio The Chinese Room made a small number of layoffs before revealing it would be going independent. In January, Splash Damage – which was bought by Tencent in 2020 – said jobs were at risk following the cancellation of Transformers: Reactivate. In September, the studio said it had been acquired by private-equity investors, then in November the entire studio was placed in consultation ahead of redundancies. In October, Oslo-based Funcom, which is owned by Tencent and is behind the open-world survival game Dune: Awakening, said it would be making job cuts as part of a restructuring. And in November, Tencent-owned studio Sharkmob, which is working on the sci-fi extraction shooter Exoborne, said it was making job cuts at its Malmo studio. NetEase studio Jar of Sparks said in January that it would be looking for a new publishing partner after NetEase pulled its funding. "As we prepare for this next step, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities," said founder and CEO Jerry Hook. Then in February, the NetEase-backed studio Liquid Swords, which was established by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios, reported a round of job cuts. A few days later, NetEase confirmed layoffs at a US support studio for Marvel Rivals, hours before revealing the game had 40 million players. NetEase also shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment (which was later resurrected by a "small group of veteran directors and founders"), divested Fantastic Pixel Castle (which subsequently closed), and pulled out of Bad Brain Game Studios, a studio it had set up in 2023, which closed after it failed to find a new publisher. Microsoft made some major job cuts in 2025. After a relatively small round of layoffs in January, the firm announced a 3% cut to its staff in May. But the biggest round of job cuts came in July, affecting an estimated 9,000 people, or around 4% of Microsoft's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in Microsoft's games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Microsoft's console rival Sony made cuts too, laying off staff at the PlayStation support studio Visual Arts and PS Studios Malaysia, as well as initiating redundancies at Days Gone maker Bend Studio. Unity implemented another round of cuts in February, following around 1,800 job losses in January 2024, and Amazon announced an enormous 14,000 layoffs in October, which resulted in work ceasing on the MMO New World. Intel, meanwhile, announced layoffs in April and July as part of cost-cutting measures. Meta laid off a number of people in 2025, cutting 5% of staff in January, and then making further cuts to the Reality Labs division in April. But there could be bigger cuts to come, after Bloomberg reported that Meta is allegedly planning to slash budgets in its Reality Labs division by as much as 30% in 2026. Netflix-owned Night School Studio cut an undisclosed number of staff in February, and Krafton-owned Striking Distance Studios – which was behind The Callisto Protocol – made layoffs in March. Square Enix, meanwhile, implemented a "fundamental restructuring" in November, pulling resources away from "overseas" development studios and putting over 100 jobs at risk. Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics cut staff in March, August, and November, before unveiling Tomb Raider: Catalyst at the Game Awards in December, which is being published by Amazon. In addition, the Embracer studio Eidos Montreal, which was behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, was allegedly hit with layoffs in December, following an earlier round of cuts in March. In February, Warner Bros. Games announced it was shuttering Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros San Diego, as well as cancelling its upcoming Wonder Woman game. Monolith had been operating for over 30 years, and was behind games such as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Player First Games was behind the brawler MultiVersus, and Warner acquired the studio in July 2024 before cancelling the game in January 2025. Ubisoft made numerous job cuts in 2025. In January, it made redundancies at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections, and announced the closure of Ubisoft Leamington. Then in July, it announced 19 layoffs at the Tom Clancy: Ghost Recon studio Red Storm, followed by nine job losses in the publishing team in September. Finally, in October, it unveiled a "restructuring proposal" for the Finland-based RedLynx studio that could affect up to 60 positions, shortly before announcing plans to offer voluntary redundancies to staff at its Swedish subsidiary Massive Entertainment. EA also cut a number of jobs this year, beginning with the EA studio Respawn cancelling two "early-stage" incubation projects and cutting developers from its Apex Legends and Star Wars: Jedi teams, resulting in approximately 100 layoffs. On the same day, EA announced a further 200 job losses, chiefly affecting EA's Experiences team. A day later, EA said it was "pausing development" of the World Rally Championship series, leading to layoffs at Codemasters. Finally, there were a number of cuts at studios owned by Take-Two Interactive. 2K Games confirmed in August that it had "reduced the size of the development team" working on BioShock 4, which is being developed by the Californian studio Cloud Chamber. Then in September, 2K confirmed a "reduction" in the headcount at Civilization and XCOM developer Firaxis. But most controversially, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Take-Two-owned Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. This article has been updated to add the various Warner Bros.

December 19, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While much of the public narrative around the technology sector has focused on layoffs and workforce reductions, industry analysts point to a parallel and more consequential shift unfolding beneath the headlines. One organization addressing the growing gap between AI talent demand and available expertise is Interview Kickstart, whose Advanced Machine Learning Course is designed to help professionals build production-ready AI skills aligned with hiring expectations at large technology companies. Major technology companies are concentrating resources around artificial intelligence engineering at an unprecedented scale, signaling a structural transformation in how technical talent is hired, organized, and valued across the industry. The multi-month program spans core programming fundamentals through advanced machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and deployment practices, with instruction led by engineers from FAANG and other Tier-1 firms. More information about the course is available at https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course#interview-preparation. Public workforce data and industry research indicate that AI engineering teams at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Meta have expanded significantly over the past several years, even as broader headcount reductions occurred elsewhere. By late 2024, these firms collectively employed tens of thousands of engineers in roles dedicated to machine learning, generative AI, data infrastructure, and applied AI systems. Analysts note that this concentration of AI expertise has few historical precedents in the technology sector. This expansion reflects deliberate strategic repositioning rather than reactive hiring. In the years leading up to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools, large technology firms increased investment in AI talent, computing infrastructure, and internal research capacity. Hiring trends from 2019 through 2024 show sustained growth in specialized AI roles, suggesting that companies were anticipating changes in how products and services would be built and delivered. Notably, this hiring momentum continued even during periods of broader workforce contraction. While companies reduced staffing in areas such as marketing, operations, and general administration, AI engineering teams were largely protected and, in some cases, expanded. Industry observers interpret this as a clear signal that AI-related roles are viewed as central to long-term competitiveness rather than discretionary investments. The resulting labor market has become increasingly segmented. Professionals with experience building and deploying AI systems at scale are in high demand, while roles centered on routine implementation or narrowly scoped tasks face growing automation pressure. Recruiters report that AI engineering positions often require experience beyond theoretical knowledge, including hands-on work with large language models, data pipelines, distributed systems, and production deployment. This demand has outpaced supply. Despite sustained hiring efforts, many organizations report difficulty filling AI engineering roles due to a shortage of candidates with relevant, production-level experience. As a result, qualified professionals are often able to choose among multiple opportunities, particularly at organizations with significant AI infrastructure and research investments. However, industry analysts emphasize that access to these roles depends on depth of expertise. Companies are not simply seeking familiarity with AI concepts; they are evaluating candidates on their ability to design, implement, and maintain complex systems under real-world constraints. This includes considerations such as scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and responsible deployment. The distinction between conceptual understanding and applied expertise has become increasingly important. Professionals who have built and operated AI systems in production environments are better positioned to meet hiring criteria than those whose exposure is limited to coursework or isolated experiments. This has led many engineers and data professionals to pursue structured upskilling as a way to bridge the gap. Interview Kickstart's Advanced Machine Learning Course is structured around this industry reality. The program emphasizes applied learning through live instruction, hands-on projects, and capstone work modeled on real business scenarios across sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare, cybersecurity, and financial technology. According to the company, the curriculum is regularly updated to reflect emerging requirements, including agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, scalable model deployment, and machine learning operations. In addition to technical training, the program integrates interview preparation and career coaching. Participants engage in mock interviews with instructors who have experience hiring for AI and ML roles, along with resume and behavioral coaching designed to reflect evaluation standards at large technology firms. This combination aims to align skill development with real-world hiring processes. Industry observers note that as AI adoption accelerates, the need for professionals who can translate AI capabilities into reliable products and systems will continue to grow. Structured programs that combine technical depth with practical application may play an increasingly important role in preparing professionals for this evolving landscape.

Title: New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-lottery-new-rules-salary-big-tech-students-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:22:01Z
Full Content:
The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 85,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in. This fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out. The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments on the rule and preparing the final text. Three months after President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B workers, Business Insider has assessed what's changed, who is benefiting, and who is getting hurt. Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one. Suddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company. The Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been "deliberately exploited" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts. In a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to "root out fraud." "The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended," Tragesser said. Meanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules. A State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis. Immigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies. The fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots. Large enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms. Justin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success. The wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery. "Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission," said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups "may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system." One exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high. Under the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal. New grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all. Alcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules. On paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said. The Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent. The tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding. Immigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance. Domestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches. "One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing," said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. "Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday." Correction: December 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of H-1B visas approved annually. The cap is 85,000 visas. Jump to

Title: How Amazon's 8.5% layoff in Luxembourg raises difficult questions for Indian foreign workers

Time Published: 2025-12-19T02:35:18Z

When Amazon announced 14,000 cuts globally earlier this week, a number of these were from its tech unit in Luxembourg. Bloomberg reported that the retail giant is culling 8.5% or 370 of its 4,370 employees in the tiny European nation, its largest such job cuts here in around 20 years. The Amazon layoffs could also pose an impossible situation for Indian and other foreign workers in Luxembourg, who are likely to be among those affected. The redundancies are “adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies,” Amazon said in a memo to staff on 12 December, adding that the severance package “goes well beyond industry benchmarks”. The Luxembourg Labor Minister’s office didn’t return a request for comment on the layoffs. The Duchy of Luxembourg has employees from the United States, Australia, Egypt, India, and Tunisia working at Amazon. If any of these staff are among those fired, they will have to find another job within three months or return home. Speaking to Bloomberg, Prash Chandrasekhar, a member of the Amazon employee delegation, said some employees may have to leave the country. “I am almost sure some employees will have to leave. It’s not easy to find a job in Luxembourg, for 370 people entering the job market at the same time,” he said. Chandrasekhar added that for those seeking work in big tech in particular, there is no real alternative to Amazon. Notably, to fire employees in the European Union (EU), companies must hold negotiations with employee representatives and sometimes the government. After two weeks of such discussions, Amazon reduced its job cuts in Luxembourg from 470 to 370, Bloomberg added. Amazon will notify a number of the affected employees of their termination in February, Chandrasekhar said. The report added that Amazon's layoffs in the 680,000-population country could trigger some “speed bumps” in the so far mutually beneficial relationship between the tech giant and tax haven nation. Luxembourg is known as a tax haven and financial centre with relatively high wages and low-income taxes, which have benefited many foreign companies. Amazon has since 2003 steadily expanded in the country and even after the layoffs will be Luxembourg’s fifth-largest employer. An employee told Bloomberg anonymously that most of the cuts are expected to be among software developers as artificial intelligence (AI) use grows, and to “trim” the workforce hired during the pandemic-era boom. The General Luxembourg Workers’ Organization (OGBL) union and other unions allege that Amazon has been granted “outsized” tax benefits in Luxembourg. The BB report said that Amazon and other foreign companies have set up holding companies in Luxembourg, through which they funnel European operations. It added that Amazon uses accounting rules deemed legal by European courts in 2023 to routinely declare losses on its continental operations and minimise tax burden. Last year, according to public records, the Luxembourg-based holding company Amazon EU Sarl reported €70.4 billion ($82.8 billion) in EU e-commerce sales and almost the same amount of expenses, including employee costs, leaving the company with a tax on profit of just €180 million. In November, Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden met Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in Seattle, and later stressed in a LinkedIn post that the company remains a “vital partner” for Luxembourg. In a comment under the post, Jassy replied, “Luxembourg’s been an important home for Amazon and our 4,000 teammates there. Appreciated the discussion and partnership.” (With inputs from Bloomberg) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

December 18, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SANTA CLARA, CA - December 18, 2025 - - The global technology sector is entering a period of structural workforce realignment as artificial intelligence reshapes how work is performed inside large enterprises. Recent layoffs across major technology firms, coupled with record levels of investment in AI infrastructure and automation, indicate a strategic shift in hiring priorities rather than a cyclical slowdown, according to industry analysts tracking employment and capital allocation trends across the sector. One organization addressing this shift is Interview Kickstart, an upskilling platform that offers training programs focused on AI, machine learning, and advanced engineering roles thorugh its Advanced Generative AI program. Publicly reported data indicates that more than 100,000 roles have been eliminated across the global technology sector in 2025, with workforce reductions occurring at companies commonly grouped under the FAANG umbrella as well as other large enterprises. These workforce changes have coincided with sustained investment in AI-related initiatives, including infrastructure, tooling, and research, signaling a reallocation of resources rather than a retreat from innovation. Executives at several major technology companies have acknowledged that AI is altering how work is performed. Public statements from industry leaders have emphasized the need for organizations to redesign workflows, automate routine tasks, and increase productivity through AI-assisted systems. In many cases, this has involved consolidating teams and prioritizing roles that focus on system-level decision-making, AI deployment, and operational oversight. At the same time, companies have continued to invest heavily in AI platforms and services. Financial disclosures and earnings calls across the sector show that capital expenditure on AI infrastructure has increased year over year, reflecting long-term strategic commitments. Industry observers note that this combination of workforce reductions and AI investment suggests a structural realignment of job roles rather than a contraction of the technology sector as a whole. This environment has created a complex landscape for technology professionals. Roles centered on routine implementation, manual processes, or narrowly defined responsibilities are increasingly vulnerable to automation. Conversely, demand continues to grow for professionals who can design, build, deploy, and manage AI systems in production environments. These roles often require a blend of engineering fundamentals, applied AI knowledge, and the ability to evaluate trade-offs in complex systems. Recruiters and hiring managers report that job descriptions are evolving accordingly. Many roles now emphasize experience with machine learning pipelines, generative AI systems, autonomous agents, and AI-assisted workflows, alongside traditional software engineering and system design skills. This has prompted many professionals to reassess their skill sets and pursue structured upskilling as a way to remain competitive. Interview Kickstart provides structured learning pathways designed to help professionals develop applied skills aligned with current hiring expectations at large technology firms. The offerings include multi-month programs that cover foundational machine learning concepts, deep learning, generative AI, and agent-based systems. The curriculum emphasizes practical application, with live instruction and project work intended to reflect real-world use cases. According to the company, these programs are designed to support professionals transitioning from adjacent technical roles as well as those seeking deeper specialization in AI-driven systems. In addition to technical instruction, Interview Kickstart integrates interview preparation and career coaching into its programs. Participants receive feedback from instructors with industry experience, along with mock interviews designed to mirror hiring processes at large technology companies. This approach reflects the increasingly rigorous evaluation standards used for AI-related roles, which often assess both technical depth and decision-making ability. Industry analysts note that traditional, short-term upskilling approaches may be insufficient in this environment. As AI capabilities expand, employers are placing greater value on professionals who can operate across the full lifecycle of AI systems, from design and deployment to monitoring and optimization. This has elevated the importance of sustained, structured learning over ad hoc skill acquisition. While the pace of change has introduced uncertainty for many technology workers, it has also clarified the types of expertise likely to remain relevant. Professionals with production-level AI experience, strong engineering fundamentals, and the ability to adapt to evolving tools are expected to play a central role in the next phase of the technology sector's development. As companies continue to integrate AI into their operations, workforce transformation is likely to remain a defining feature of the industry. For professionals navigating this transition, access to structured education and practical training may be a key factor in aligning their skills with the demands of an AI-driven economy.

Throughout 2025, corporate America has engaged in a frantic restructuring of the labor market, cutting more than 1.17 million jobs in the first 11 months of the year, a 54% increase from 2024. From the 14,000 corporate cuts at tech giants like Amazon to the nearly 300,000 federal civil service reductions, the narrative driving this contraction is uniform: we are shedding excess labor to make room for the streamlined, high-margin future of artificial intelligence. But the data tells a different story. This is not a calculated pivot toward higher productivity. It is a hollowing-out strategy that trades immediate payroll savings for a catastrophic erosion of human capital. By viewing AI as a mechanism for replacement rather than augmentation, leaders are incurring a strategic debt that will erase future value, stifle innovation, and, crucially, institutionalize the kind of algorithmic bias that costs companies billions. We are trying to build the future of work by burning down the infrastructure required to support it. The prevailing logic in the C-Suite is a simple subtraction equation: lower headcount plus automated tools equals higher margins. However, this ignores the negative externalities imposed on the workforce that remains. While companies explicitly cited AI for roughly 55,000 cuts through November, there are far more job losses buried under the umbrella of restructuring, which accounted for over 128,000 job losses. Expert estimates suggest the true automation-influenced displacement is likely above 150,000. But the real cost isn’t on the severance line item; it is in the collapse of productivity among the survivors. Seventy-four percent of employees who survive layoffs report a decline in their own productivity, while 77% witness an increase in operational errors. This phenomenon, often called the layoff survivor syndrome, is a drag on performance fueled by anxiety and the erosion of institutional trust. Volatility sends a signal to your top performers: leave before you are pushed out. When companies cut costs by eliminating human capacity, they don’t get a leaner organization; they get an anxious, risk-averse, and error-prone one. The so-called productivity equation turns negative because the marginal productivity of the retained workforce plummets faster than the payroll costs decline. This productivity collapse is compounded by a fundamental misunderstanding of how AI generates value. While 85% of organizations are increasing their AI investment, only 6% are seeing a payback in under a year. The answer lies in the implementation. A staggering 59% of organizations are taking a technology-first approach, treating AI as a bolt-on solution rather than undertaking organizational redesign. Even more alarming is where the cuts are happening. The 2025 layoffs are disproportionately targeting mid-layer management, including HR, talent acquisition, and compliance roles. The result is a growing governance gap. At the exact moment companies are deploying black-box algorithms that require intense oversight, they are firing the overseers. 34% of organizations already expect a shortage in specialist compliance skills. By dismantling these internal guardrails, companies are not streamlining; they are removing the ethical braking systems required to prevent reputational and financial ruin. AI is not a replacement for human judgment; it is an accelerator of it. But you cannot accelerate what you have already liquidated. Here is where the economic argument becomes inseparable from the equity argument. The hollowing out of 2025 has not been neutral. It has systematically targeted the very demographics that drive financial outperformance. The data reveal a profound asymmetry in risk exposure. Women are significantly more vulnerable to the current wave of automation, with 79% of employed women concentrated in high-risk occupations compared to 58% of men. This differential means women are 1.4 times more exposed to displacement. We see this specifically in the hollowing out of critical pipeline positions that enable women to ascend to leadership. However, the canary in the coal mine for the broader economy is the crisis facing Black women. By November 2025, the unemployment rate for Black women remained at a staggering 7.1%, more than double the 3.4% rate for White women. This was driven by a perfect storm: high exposure to private sector automation combined with the erasure of 300,000 federal jobs, a sector where Black women have historically found stability. The reality on the ground confirms this is a systemic failure, not a skills gap. Keisha Bross, Director of Opportunity, Race and Justice at the NAACP, reports that she has “not seen interventions happening” to support this displaced workforce. The result? At recent NAACP job fairs, 80% of applicants held bachelor’s degrees yet were lining up for same-day interviews for low-wage roles. We are witnessing the hollowing out of the Black middle class in real-time. Leaders often view these statistics as a social problem. They are wrong. This is a P&L problem. There is a hard, quantitative link between intersectional equity and revenue. Research across more than 4,000 companies in 29 countries shows that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there is a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Venture capital data further reinforces this, showing that investments in female-founded startups yield a 63% better return on investment than those with male founders. By allowing layoffs to disproportionately target women and people of color, companies are forfeiting a measurable economic dividend. The financial danger of a homogenous workforce extends directly into the AI models themselves. If your AI team and your data sources lack diversity, your algorithms will be biased. This is no longer a theoretical risk—it is a tangible liability. More than one-third of organizations have already suffered negative impacts from AI bias, with 62% reporting lost revenue and 61% reporting lost customers. The legal doctrine of disparate impact creates massive liability for companies whose algorithms discriminate in hiring or lending, regardless of intent. This tension is starkly visible. On one side, we have the nation’s largest civil rights organization, the NAACP, flagging systemic risk. On the other, we have tech giants like Google and Meta, recently crowned Time’s ‘Person of the Year’, who landed on the NAACP’s Consumer Advisory List by rolling back the very protections meant to ensure that revolution is equitable. This contradiction is not ideological; it’s economic: alienating a demographic with $1.7 trillion in annual buying power. When you remove the diverse talent capable of spotting bias, and the compliance officers capable of reporting it, you guarantee that your AI products will be flawed, biased, and ultimately, litigated. To reverse this erosion of value, executives must stop viewing labor as a cost to be minimized and start viewing work design as the primary investment vehicle for AI success. AI governance must move from the server room to the Boardroom. Boards must include members with the technical literacy to challenge management on model stability and data quality. We must recognize that responsible AI unlocks value and accelerates development by ensuring reliability. We must shift our strategy from automation (replacing heads) to augmentation (increasing value). Data shows that job numbers actually grow in AI-exposed fields when companies focus on augmentation. This requires a massive investment in skilling, specifically targeting the non-degree holders who are 3.5 times more likely to lose their jobs. Finally, we must embed intersectional equity into the core business strategy. This means using advanced analytics to monitor the talent lifecycle and ensure that restructuring efforts do not decimate the diversity pipeline. It means recognizing that the $12 trillion global economic opportunity of gender equity is only accessible if we actively retain women in the workforce. The 1.17 million layoffs of 2025 represent a fork in the road. One path leads to a hollowed-out future: a short-term spike in cash flow followed by a long-term decline in innovation, a rise in algorithmic liability, and a workforce paralyzed by fear. The other path recognizes that in the age of AI, humanity is the premium asset. It acknowledges that the only way to capture the exponential ROI of automation is to pair it with a diverse, resilient, and empowered human workforce. You can cut your way to a quarterly profit, but you cannot cut your way to the future. True productivity requires us to stop subtracting humans and start solving for the convergence of equity, economics, and engineering.

Title: US jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 last week as layoffs remain low

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Last week, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said.

Title: Dead Space creator Glen Schofield calls EA & Activision’s post‑acquisition era “bittersweet” in interview

Glen Schofield has been on a roll with insights that are making waves in the video game industry of late. Known as the founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, Schofield opened up a can of worms when he detailed the “bittersweet” transformation of video game publishing juggernauts, Electronic Arts and Activision. Schofield spearheaded Dead Space at EA in 2008 and worked on its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, before departing from Striking Distance earlier in 2023. In the LinkedIn post, he looked back on his decade-long tenure at both companies during their heydays. After the word came out about EA’s pivot into private ownership by Saudi Arabia’s PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal, similar to Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard Acquisition, Schofield finally chimed in on the conversation on LinkedIn. Schofield drew parallels between the two companies and said, “In the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras.” Schofield expressed emotional turmoil, reflecting on his career at both studios, adding: I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes. Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected. It’s not without reason that Schofield viewed EA and Activision as crucibles for talent. He further detailed: EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense, no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood. Activision was a different playing field, he said, stating it was: Where review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another. However, the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal, and somehow, the time felt well spent. Schofield went down nostalgia lane, stating that both companies honed and bred a new generation of developers, but that time seems short-lived in light of recent acquisitions. He concluded the interview, stating: It’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. Mine included. His comments come at a time when the industry as a whole is reeling from a series of layoffs as AI becomes a more prominent feature in titles, and game publishers and developers alike continue to chase profitability amid rising costs and increased competition. They provide unique insight into how developers view two of the most iconic game publishers in the industry, even amid continued volatility.
