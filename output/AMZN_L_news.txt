Title: The Computer-Science Bubble Is Bursting
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/06/computer-science-bubble-ai/683242/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Artificial intelligence is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The job of the future might already be past its prime. For years, young people seeking a lucrative career were urged to go all in on computer science. From 2005 to 2023, the number of comp-sci majors in the United States quadrupled. All of which makes the latest batch of numbers so startling. This year, enrollment grew by only 0.2 percent nationally, and at many programs, it appears to already be in decline, according to interviews with professors and department chairs. At Stanford, widely considered one of the country’s top programs, the number of comp-sci majors has stalled after years of blistering growth. Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the chair of Princeton’s computer-science department, told me that, if current trends hold, the cohort of graduating comp-sci majors at Princeton is set to be 25 percent smaller in two years than it is today. The number of Duke students enrolled in introductory computer-science courses has dropped about 20 percent over the past year. But if the decline is surprising, the reason for it is fairly straightforward: Young people are responding to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. In recent years, the tech industry has been roiled by layoffs and hiring freezes. The leading culprit for the slowdown is technology itself. Artificial intelligence has proved to be even more valuable as a writer of computer code than as a writer of words. This means it is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. A recent Pew study found that Americans think software engineers will be most affected by generative AI. Many young people aren’t waiting to find out whether that’s true. “It’s so counterintuitive,” Molly Kinder, a Brookings Institution fellow who studies AI’s effect on the economy, told me. “This was supposed to be the job of the future. The way to stay ahead of technology was to go to college and get coding skills.” But the days of “Learn to code” might be coming to an end. If the numbers are any indication, we might have passed peak computer science. Chris Gropp, a doctoral student at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, has spent eight months searching for a job. He triple-majored in computer science, math, and computational science at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and has completed the coursework for a computer-science Ph.D. He would prefer to work instead of finishing his degree, but he has found it almost impossible to secure a job. He knows of only two people who recently pulled it off. One sent personalized cover letters for 40 different roles and set up meetings with people at the companies. The other submitted 600 applications. “We’re in an AI revolution, and I am a specialist in the kind of AI that we’re doing the revolution with, and I can’t find anything,” Gropp told me. “I found myself a month or two ago considering, Do I just take a break from this thing that I’ve been training for for most of my life and go be an apprentice electrician?” Gropp is contending with a weak job market for recent college graduates in general and the tech sector in particular. Although employment for 22-to-27-year-olds in other fields has grown slightly over the past three years, employment for computer-science and math jobs in that age group has fallen by 8 percent. Not long ago, graduates from top comp-sci programs—such as those at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon—would have been fending off recruiters from Google and Amazon. Now, professors at those schools told me, their graduates are having to try much harder to find work. Gropp’s dad, William Gropp, runs the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “I can say, as the father of a computer-science master’s degree holder with expertise in machine learning who is still looking for a job, that the industry is not what it used to be,” he told me. In the ultimate irony, candidates like Gropp might be unable to get jobs working on AI because AI itself is taking the jobs. “We know AI is affecting jobs,” Rusinkiewicz, from Princeton, told me. “It’s making people more efficient at some or many aspects of their jobs, and therefore, perhaps companies feel they can get away with doing a bit less hiring.” Derek Thompson: Something alarming is happening to the job market The best evidence that artificial intelligence is displacing tech workers comes from the fact that the industry that has most thoroughly integrated AI is the one with such unusually high unemployment. Tech leaders have said publicly that they no longer need as many entry-level coders. Executives at Alphabet and Microsoft have said that AI writes or assists with writing upwards of 25 percent of their code. (Microsoft recently laid off 6,000 workers.) Anthropic’s chief product officer recently told The New York Times that senior engineers are giving work to the company’s chatbot instead of a low-level human employee. The company’s CEO has warned that AI could replace half of all entry-level workers in the next five years. Kinder, the Brookings fellow, said she worries that companies soon will simply eliminate the entire bottom rung of the career ladder. The plight of the tech grads, she told me, could be a warning for all entry-level white-collar workers. Not everyone agrees that AI is causing the turbulence in the job market. The tech industry frequently goes through booms and busts. The biggest companies exploded in size when the economy was good. Now, with high interest rates and the specter of new tariffs, executives are likely holding off on expanding, and workers are reluctant to leave their job, says Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Companies have an incentive to blame layoffs on AI instead of forces within their control, David Deming, an economics professor at Harvard, told me. “Before we see big changes from AI in the labor market, companies have to internalize this new capability and change what they ask for. And that’s the thing that I have not seen very much of,” he said. “It could be AI, but we just don’t know.” Enrollment in the computer-science major has historically fluctuated with the job market. When jobs are scarce, people choose to study something else. Eventually, there aren’t enough computer-science graduates, salaries go up, and more people are drawn in. Prior declines have always rebounded to enrollment levels higher than where they started. (And some universities, such as the University of Chicago, still haven’t seen any enrollment drops.) Sam Madden, a computer-science professor at MIT, told me that even if companies are employing generative AI, that will likely create more demand for software engineers, not less. Read: Silicon Valley braces for chaos Whether the past few years augur a temporary lull or an abrupt reordering of working life, economists suggest the same response for college students: Major in a subject that offers enduring, transferable skills. Believe it or not, that could be the liberal arts. Deming’s research shows that male history and social-science majors end up out-earning their engineering and comp-sci counterparts in the long term, as they develop the soft skills that employers consistently seek out. “It’s actually quite risky to go to school to learn a trade or a particular skill, because you don’t know what the future holds,” Deming told me. “You need to try to think about acquiring a skill set that’s going to be future-proof and last you for 45 years of working life.” Of course, when faced with enormous uncertainty, many young people take the opposite approach and pursue something with a sure path to immediate employment. The question of the day is how many of those paths AI will soon foreclose.

Title: CEOs Using AI to Terrorize Their Employees
URL: https://futurism.com/ceo-ai-scare-labor
Time Published: 2025-06-20T17:09:36Z
Full Content:
As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else. Of course, AI, like many new technologies, will also create new jobs, but it’s not yet clear how many. Amazon partner Anthropic predicts even more sweeping layoffs coming. Agentic AI is the disruption du jour at this year’s TM Forum DTW Ignite conference Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab valued at $10B after $2B fundraising (per Financial Times) Google updates Gemini 2.5 LLM series with new entry-level model, pricing changes Midjourney debuts new V1 video generation model Domino Data Lab introduces new AI governance, data management features Nurix AI launches enterprise-grade human-like voice AI agents with NuPlay Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation OpenAI bags $200M Pentagon contract to explore defense industry AI applications Healthcare technology startup Commure raises $200M ahead of IPO AI startup Tennr raises $101M to revolutionize patient referrals Clay reportedly raises new funding led by CapitalG on a $3B valuation Maven AGI, which aims to unify the full “customer journey,” raised $50M in Series B funding Traversal launches with $48M to tackle site reliability and observability with AI Wildfire detection startup Pano AI raises $44M (per WSJ) Browserbase reels in $40M for its browser automation tools Sedai raises $20M to optimize cloud environments with AI agents Tadaweb raises $20M to scale open-source intelligence platform enhanced with AI Extend gets $17M in funding to boost the speed and accuracy of document processing with AI models Diskover gets $7.5M from Snowflake, NetApp and others to facilitate unstructured data discovery for AI Startup Typedef gets $5.5M seed funding to build customized data pipelines for AI model workloads There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Broadcom says VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 recognizes the ascendancy of private cloud And our analysis: VCF 9 goes live: Recapping the execution roadmap for Broadcom’s AI and cloud infrastructure vision Pure Storage launches unified data management cloud and new flash arrays AWS to introduce updated server CPU, new AI training chip Vibe coding, platform power and the new face of AppDev – theCUBE Research analysis Mixpanel expands analytics platform with metric trees, AI insights and experimentation tools Trend Micro debuts data center appliances with built-in cybersecurity software Key takeaways from Cisco Live 2025 Texas Instruments to invest $60B+ in US fab network Amazon to invest nearly $13B in data centers in Australia Coralogix gets $115M in funding to pioneer agentic AI-powered observability Defense technology startup Mach Industries raises $100M PostHog raises $70M to simplify software development projects Clinical AI startup Nabla to focus on agentic automation after raising $70M in funding With $27M in funding, Fleet wants to bring more freedom to enterprise device management Onebrief, a platform for operational planning and military staff workflows, reaches $1.1B valuation with $20M Series C extension, nearly doubling in 3 months Tensec to deliver real-time, cross-border payments to smaller businesses after raising $10M in funding We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Security researchers find 16B stolen credentials from malware in open cloud storage UBS confirms employee data leak after ransomware attack on supplier INKY warns of new QR code phishing tactic using embedded JavaScript AWS focuses on simplifying cloud security at re:Inforce 2025 conference CrowdStrike launches Falcon for AWS Security Incident Response at re:Inforce 2025 Operant AI expands Gatekeeper platform with MCP Gateway for AI runtime security New Commvault and Kyndryl partnership focuses on hybrid cloud recovery and regulatory compliance Apiiro report reveals industry differences are shaping generative AI risk profiles Kusari debuts AI-powered pull request security tool for software supply chain protection Cyolo updates privileged access platform with tools to monitor unmanaged vendor connections Dashlane adds AI phishing alerts to Omnix platform to bolster credential protection Base44 joins Wix in $80M deal to support natural language software development Bitdefender to acquire Mesh Security to bolster email protection for managed service providers Neovera acquires Greenway Solutions to expand fraud testing capabilities More cybersecurity news here Waymo’s robotaxis will soon hit the streets of New York City Trump will push TikTok deadline another 90 days SpaceX competitor Eutelsat raising €1.35B in new funding And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Amar Subramanya, head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, is leaving the company, employees were told in a reorganization announced last week.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Jump to

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Time Published: 2025-06-20T09:00:02Z

Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

Title: Do The Woo Community: The Value of Starting Over in the Tech Industry

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.

Title: Microsoft to lay off thousands in July, but don't worry, AI's getting $80 billion

In context: There's been plenty of talk about machines displacing human workers in the AI Age, mainly focusing on direct replacements – computers taking over tasks like design and programming. Meanwhile, spending on AI infrastructure soars as investment in human skills steadily declines. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft is preparing to lay off thousands of workers next month, with most of the cuts expected to hit the company's sales and customer service divisions. It's a jarring move but not an unfamiliar one in tech. What stands out this time is what Microsoft is doing with the money it's saving: pumping an estimated $80 billion into AI infrastructure over the next fiscal year. That number isn't a typo. As Microsoft reshapes its workforce, it's reshaping its balance sheet, too. It's laying off human employees while building new homes for silicon-based replacements – in hyperscale data centers, GPUs, and power-hungry server farms. Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to AI, but the connection is increasingly difficult to ignore. The company is investing heavily in machine learning capabilities across its entire product line, from Azure to Office. Its partnership with OpenAI and the widespread deployment of Copilot reflect a strategic pivot away from labor-intensive workflows and toward automated solutions. Despite the scale of this shift, Microsoft has offered little public indication that large-scale retraining or internal upskilling efforts are part of its AI strategy. The company clearly has the resources to help employees adapt to an AI-centric future, yet such initiatives are largely absent from its announcements and disclosures. The emphasis so far has been on infrastructure, partnerships, and AI product rollouts – not on preparing its broader workforce for the changes those investments will bring. This approach reflects a broader trend across the tech sector. Companies including Amazon, Duolingo, and Dropbox have all cited AI-driven efficiency gains when announcing workforce reductions. These moves often emphasize shareholder value and operational agility, even as they diminish opportunities for employees to transition into new roles within the organization. Microsoft plans to lay off thousands globally in the coming weeks. While the company has not disclosed exact figures, reports suggest a significant impact on customer-facing teams. These cuts underscore the shift away from labor-intensive roles as Microsoft pivots toward automation and AI-driven services. The contrast is stark: AI receives billions in dedicated capital, while workers get severance packages and uncertain futures. Microsoft isn't just betting on artificial intelligence – it's actively reorganizing its operations around it. This strategy may pay off in the long term, but it highlights a widening gap between investment in automation and support for displaced employees.

Title: Amazon To Cut 1,000 Jobs Due To AI. Now What?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2025/06/19/amazon-to-cut-1000-jobs-due-to-ai-now-what/
Time Published: 2025-06-19T19:04:32Z

ByEli Amdur ByEli Amdur, Contributor. Giant robot flicking tiny man. Ai technologies and unemployment problem concept. Vector ... More illustration. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it would cut 1,000 jobs due to AI. Is anyone surprised? The monster created by Big Tech has begun rising up to consume its creator. Well, perhaps not totally consume, but the damage done could likely be (a) measurable, (b) a harbinger of things to come at Amazon, and (c) a phenomenon we will see far and wide, not just at Amazon. It’s inescapable for a few reasons. First, according to data from layoffs.fyi, which monitors tech worker layoffs, already this year 141 companies have laid off 62,832 employees. In 2024, it was 152,922 employees from 551 companies and in 2023, it was 264,220 employees from 1,193 companies. Layoffs, we see, are inevitable – especially in tech. At the onset of new technologies or the introduction of new products, hiring takes place with kid-in-a-candy-store concern for consequences. A year later, things look quite different – and that kid is now an obese diabetic. Now, however, we see a direct cause and effect, unmistakenly traceable to AI, because AI has advanced so quickly that it is now capable of doing many of those lower, entry-level jobs we’ve long feared it could do. I am reminded of the classic line from the 1960s comic strip Pogo: “We have met the enemy and it is us.” Make no mistake, though, this is not limited to tech jobs. In May, I posted a column here, “How AI Affects The Socioeconomic Order Of The Workplace” (5/27) and here’s what we saw: Beginner programmers and coders, data analysts, junior paralegals, retail sales associates, content writers, copy editors, graphic artists, and grant writers are among the many who will deal with this reality. There’s more, but space and time have limits here. This phenomenon of jobs being eaten by AI will undoubtedly be seen at all tech companies, as they are the creators of this to begin with. But it will spread elsewhere. Picture lava streaming down an erupting volcano. But there’s a big upside to this. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 78 million jobs, even after job losses are factored in. So, working the math and going with aggregated and widely-accepted estimations that for every job killed by AI three or four will be created, we come to this: 78 million is the WEF’s net number, bringing us to 100 million or more, gross. Thise jobs will just not be the vulnerable entry-level jobs we’ve been discussing here. It’s complicated, no? If I were running a large company, I’d ask for a meeting. In the same room, I’d have the president of the local university or community college, my senator or congressperson, and me. I’d have one item on the agenda: those AI skills we’ve been teaching for our graduates to find their first jobs need to be relegated to high school and forever be seen as obsolete. AI will forever do them. Next, define the next level of AI jobs and teach them as the new entry level, while teaching other skills – communication, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. – that our new employees would have been developing on he way up. We are past throwing our hands in the air. This is no longer something new or mysterious. “Success delayed is success denied,” said Ben Franklin. We just simply must take the first step.

Title: The Big Picture: Streaming and Social Media Climb Amid Traditional Media’s Slow-Motion Breakdown
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/streaming-social-media-impact-on-traditional-news/
Time Published: 2025-06-19T17:00:00Z

The headlines all point toward the decline of linear and traditional models, with the nagging question of whether new means of distribution can pick up the slack Traditional media is experiencing what often feels like a slow-motion nervous breakdown, which would hardly come as news to anyone operating in the thick of that. Yet occasionally a week comes along with ostensibly distinct stories that help crystallize the larger picture, almost like the cop finally piecing things together at the end of “The Usual Suspects.” In just the last few days, a handful of reports speak to trends that coalesce into a single clarifying moment: Old media is limping along on wobbly legs, if not its death bed yet, and efforts to save it are merely prolonging the inevitable. A shift in consumption patterns for entertainment, news and information has hamstrung many long-established means of disseminating content, while pushing newer forms to the forefront. Clocking each of these developments as they fly by — sometimes while on the move ourselves, increasingly via our phones — the connections aren’t always obvious. So let’s pause for a breath and take inventory of this week’s media news, and the changing of the guard that it reveals. Part of that shift has been driven by YouTube, and as if on cue: Shorter version: Teens and young adults (especially) are spending less time watching movies and TV shows, while allocating more to snippets of video and getting their news from TikTok, not those stodgy cable networks watched by their parents and grandparents. But wait, there’s more. Netflix unveiled a groundbreaking deal Wednesday to carry the output from French broadcaster TF1, an agreement TF1 Group CEO Rodolphe Belmer described in its announcement as becoming necessary “as viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases” — a trend that has crossed international borders. Finally, Amazon issued a memo that served as a not-so-subtle warning to its employees about the impact of artificial intelligence, noting there will be layoffs associated with AI picking up tasks performed by actual humans, while offering the only modestly reassuring aside that some new jobs will be created as a byproduct of that shift. So basically, “Get on board, or get out of the way.” Although frankly, a host of recent headlines have made clear AI’s impact remains unpredictable enough that it won’t necessarily spare early adopters either, in the same way monsters in old movies frequently kill the mad scientist that unleashes them first. The main problem, grappled with since the transition from print to online and more recently the great migration to streaming that began with the launch of multiple services (including Disney+ and Apple TV+) in 2019, is the uncertainty about when these lines will intersect — whether newer revenue streams can supplant old ones, such as linear TV, before those models slide off a cliff. The newspaper industry dealt with that game of digital chicken first, as the web gobbled up its classified advertising business and distribution of print editions, falling victim to those forces despite the alarm bells sounded about trading in “print dollars for digital dimes.” Although most legacy publications have managed to survive, with a few notable exceptions like the New York Times, it’s generally in dramatically scaled-down form, both in terms of the size of their staffs and the scope of their ambitions. Step back a little further, and it’s easy to weave more pixels into the picture, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal’s spinoffs of their declining cable assets, and whether the economies of scale associated with mergers and acquisitions can be enough to justify anteing up for an entity whose trend lines point in the wrong direction. In “The Usual Suspects,” the messy cop defends his scattered work area by telling a colleague, “It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.” In the daily scramble of these jobs, including the race to cover these stories, it can be difficult to take the time to seek perspective or try connecting the dots, making things appear messier, even chaotic. Whether the view is from up close or gains clarity from far away, though, the prospects for traditional media don’t paint a comforting picture.

Title: Microsoft Plans Layoffs Targeting Sales Teams

Microsoft is gearing up for another round of layoffs, with plans to cut thousands of jobs with a specific focus on its sales workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reports that technology giant Microsoft is preparing to trim its workforce once again, with the latest round of job cuts expected to be announced in early July, following the close of the company’s fiscal year. Sources close to the situation revealed that the layoffs will predominantly impact sales positions, although other teams may also be affected. The exact timing of the announcement could still change. This news comes on the heels of a previous wave of layoffs in May, which involved 6,000 employees losing their jobs, primarily in product and engineering roles. The customer-facing positions, such as sales and marketing, were largely spared during that round of cuts. In April, Microsoft informed employees of its intention to rely more heavily on third-party firms for the sale of software to small and medium-sized businesses, potentially foreshadowing the upcoming reductions in the sales force. As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, spending tens of billions of dollars on servers and data centers, executives have pledged to Wall Street and cautioned employees that the company will maintain a tight grip on spending in other areas. The company has stated that it regularly assesses its organizational structure to ensure it is allocating resources effectively for growth. At the end of June 2024, Microsoft had a total of 228,000 employees, with 45,000 of them working in sales and marketing positions. The company has a history of restructuring teams and announcing other organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. Breitbart News previously reported on a significant layoff in January that impacted the company’s security division: One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort.

Title: I'm a former Amazon developer. Jassy's memo doesn't surprise me, and I don't think engineers should worry about their jobs.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jassy-memo-former-amazon-employee-not-worried-ai-jobs-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-19T13:29:05Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 30-year-old Shahad Ishraq, from Germany. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Reading Andy Jassy's new memo on generative AI, I'm not surprised by anything. I worked at Amazon for nearly 3 ½ years and left in late May because of the five-day return-to-office mandate. My commute took an hour and a half each way, so I wanted to move to another job where I could still see my career progressing and do interesting work. The memo feels consistent with what I'd been hearing from management and Jassy while working at Amazon. I think Jassy's comments are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. I initially worried about AI when I wasn't as familiar with the products. However, using AI will give you a better understanding of what it's capable of and what skills you can develop to differentiate yourself. I joined Amazon in 2022 as a systems development engineer, working in Leipzig, Germany. My day-to-day work involved designing and implementing software and performing operational tasks. When AI tools first came out a few years ago, we were told we could use them, but we should be very careful and follow the company's policies on their usage. Amazon is a huge company. Within it, I spotted and heard about different approaches to AI adoption. There seemed to be a bunch of excited early adopters who shared their findings with everyone. There were people like me who followed the first bunch and saw what went well. There were also some skeptics and a small number of engineers who were outright against using AI. For me, the dawn of AI was a bit scary at first. Everyone was saying it would put me out of a job. Unless you test the technology yourself and see what it can do, you'll fear the unknown. AI wasn't part of my job until sometime in 2024. There were also some barriers to using the technology. When I first joined Amazon, ChatGPT wasn't even available, but when it did come out in 2022, we couldn't use it that extensively because of data security issues that come with copying our code into those models. When Anthropic's Claude became available within Amazon Bedrock — the company's internal service for developing generative AI applications — we were able to make more use of AI. In my last few months at Amazon, I started experimenting a lot with approved AI tools, doing extensive tests with them. They don't do everything for me, but I've integrated these tools into my workflow, such as by asking it to create a plan for my tasks or spot differences between documents. I noticed it often fails, and I have to make changes, but overall, it has improved my speed and increased my throughput significantly. Andy Jassy's memo feels very consistent with what I've been told internally before I left Amazon and what the company has communicated publicly. News articles talking about the memo focus on Jassy saying that a lot of jobs will be taken by AI. However, in the same sentence, he also says jobs will be created. I've tried creating production-level applications using AI, and it takes a lot of effort to get these products ready. A company like Amazon can't roll out an application that breaks and causes havoc. They have to have firewalls, checks, and tests. I don't see people going out of jobs in huge numbers soon. Amazon went on a hiring spree during COVID. If we see more layoffs, I think it will be associated with cutting back after that spree, rather than the impacts of AI. AI agents are helping out software engineers a lot, and the amount of work agents do will probably increase gradually. I'm able to get agents working on three different things, while I look into other tasks. But AI hallucinates quite a lot. It does things it's not asked to do. I often have to correct an AI agent producing code. Humans will be required to build guardrails and act as guardrails themselves. Implementing these guardrails will take time, and I think this will slow down the AI agent hype. I think Jassy's comments about AI are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. Memos have to come out. Jassy has to place a lot of optimism around AI; otherwise, shareholders will think they're not doing anything with AI. My advice to Amazon employees is to start using AI as much as possible to overcome their fear of the unknown. I now work as a software engineer at a utilities company. The more I've been using AI, the more comfortable I feel about myself. I can see what skills I have that I can use to stay relevant. In tech, languages and developments come really fast. My guess is that people will need to use AI to write code and increase their throughput, and pure software engineers will gradually be replaced by people who have both software engineering and AI skills. I'm personally trying to learn these skills because I think they'll become more important. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider: "Amazon employees use internal generative AI tools every day to innovate on behalf of our customers. We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including restrictions on sharing confidential information with third-party generative AI services."

Title: Amazon is apparently forcing some workers to relocate to its main office hubs

Amazon updates its office-working policy once again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is requiring some corporate workers to relocate closer to their managers and teams, targeting cities like Seattle, Arlington and Washington DC (via Bloomberg). The report notes thousands of employees could be forced to move from across various teams, however the company's famously vocal workers are understandably frustrated with the decision. Amazon has been reassessing where employees work for several months, with the company's leader publicly advocating for office-based working. Although relocating isn't always a problem for new starters, many mid-career workers are hesitant to move due to personal and financial challenges – a move would mean uprooting families, children switching schools and partners seeking other jobs. The report suggests that workers have 30 days to decide, followed by a 60-day period to relocate or resign. It also claims that those who refuse to relocate will not be receiving severance packages. Amazon contested this, adding that teammates will receive relocation support, and that timelines for relocations could vary by case. Amazon's relocation trend has already been ongoing for more than a year, with CEO Andy Jassy previously claiming that in-person working boost ad-hoc interactions and, therefore, productivity. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! "We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," Jassy said. Amazon now requires workers to come to the office five days per week, but that policy got delayed at the end of 2024 due to a lack of readiness – there simply weren't enough desks. "We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances," a company spokesperson stated. Some workers worry that the policy shift could be an effort to push workers away from the company – although thousands lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon's layoffs in the years that followed have been relatively small (compared with other giants in the industry). An Amazon spokesperson stressed that the policy is not new, but that it's taking a team-by-team approach to in-office working, and that relative to the number of workers the company has overall, the proportion affected is small.

Title: Microsoft to cut thousands more jobs, mainly in sales
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/4009594/microsoft-to-cut-thousands-more-jobs-mainly-in-sales.html
Time Published: 2025-06-19T11:50:42Z

Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs, mainly in sales, amid growing fears that AI advances are accelerating the replacement of human roles across the industry, Bloomberg reports. The cuts follow a previous round in May, which saw approximately 6,000 roles eliminated. Microsoft has been ramping up its AI investments to strengthen its position as enterprises across industries rush to integrate the technology into their operations. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend around $80 billion in fiscal 2025, largely on building data centers to support AI training and cloud-based applications. Adding to industry unease, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week that generative AI and AI agents are expected to shrink the company’s corporate workforce over time. AI is being used as an excuse for layoffs this year, but there may be more to it than what meets the eye. “One, we are still rebalancing employee counts from the over-hiring of the past decade,” said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst of Amalgam Insights. “Tech companies were hiring with the assumption that they would grow at ridiculous rates that have not come to pass. Also, some tech companies think they can simply get rid of salespeople, especially in cash-cow industries where renewals seem to come in with little to no effort. Whether that is actually true or not, we are about to find out.”The job cuts may also signal concerns about the near-term revenue potential of AI, Park said. While Microsoft is under pressure to invest heavily in AI to sustain its stock valuation, it may be turning to short-term operating expense reductions to support its financial performance. “The planned $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure is especially interesting because those numbers assume a massive number of people will adopt Microsoft-related AI products,” Park said. “Are 50 million+ people willing to pay an additional amount on Microsoft products to support AI? That is a massive bet that has been completely unjustified by the current AI market today.”Others point out that the company is betting on a long-term inflection in enterprise workload patterns driven by GenAI, but current adoption patterns remain volatile. “Reports of Microsoft pausing or renegotiating data center leases reflect a prudent but necessary response to these uncertainties,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “If workloads fail to scale or regulatory barriers increase, Microsoft, and by extension, other hyperscalers, could face underutilized infrastructure, prompting pricing recalibrations or service tier stratification.” The focus on sales roles in the planned cuts is notable, with analysts saying it reflects a broader shift in how enterprise sales functions are evolving. “The rise of AI copilots, telemetry-rich self-service portals, and data-driven journey mapping is reducing the need for large in-region sales teams,” Gogia said. “Microsoft’s realignment is part of a broader pattern also visible in Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.” However, while AI can personalize interactions at scale, it lacks the relational depth required in strategic deal-making, compliance negotiation, and multi-stakeholder orchestration, Gogia added.

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the plans. Details about the layoffs are scarce, but Bloomberg says it will be announced early next month once Microsoft’s fiscal year ends. The cuts will impact multiple departments, but Microsoft's sales team is expected to take the biggest hit. The report arrives just a month after Microsoft removed 6,000 jobs across various departments and seniority levels. It was done to reduce management layers and “best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft said at the time. As of June 2024, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, and 45,000 of them were in sales and marketing. According to Bloomberg, the previous round of layoffs had largely left the sales and marketing teams untouched. In April, however, the company informed employees that it plans to use third-party firms for the marketing of software to small and mid-size customers. This strategy could help Microsoft reduce operational costs by relying on gig workers for short-term campaigns instead of full-time staff. Microsoft has also vowed to invest over $80 billion in data centers for AI development, but it’s unclear if that has anything to do with the back-to-back layoffs. The months ahead may be tough for tech workers, with more layoffs looming across major firms. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just announced that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer. Intel is also planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles.

Title: Microsoft reportedly set to cut thousands of jobs, with sales roles particularly at risk

Microsoft is warming up for more redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is preparing to cut thousands of jobs as part of its ongoing cost-cutting shakeup as the company continues to spend big on AI. A new Bloomberg report says if confirmed, the layoffs could be announced in early July after the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end on June 30, 2025. Sales teams could be the worst affected, but the redundancies could span other departments as Microsoft looks to reduce employment-related expenses. The company has already cut thousands of workers off in these post-pandemic years. In May 2025, it cut 6,000 of its workers, equating to around 3% of its roughly 228,000 headcount, in an effort to reduce inefficiencies by removing middle management tiers. A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024. In April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms – an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month. Despite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations. TechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response. While highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty. Key rivals like Amazon and Google have also been making regular adjustments to their headcounts to optimize costs and output.

Microsoft is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of employees early next month following the closure of its 2025 fiscal year. According to a report from Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, the layoffs will mostly impact sales team, though the timing of the announcement could still change. In May, Microsoft already laid off 3 percent of its workforce, with the job cuts affecting approximately 6,000 people. In January, the company also laid off employees working on security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming.

Currently, the company is also investing heavily in developing its AI infrastructure, and it is on track to spend over $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s recent job cuts in May primarily affected software engineers, as up to 30% of the code for some of the company’s projects is now being written by AI. And the Redmond giant isn’t the only Big Tech company to reduce its workforce amid the ongoing AI boom. In a note to employees shared on Tuesday (via the Wall Street Journal), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI developments will force the company to adapt its structure in the coming years. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

NEW YORK – Microsoft is planning to axe thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as part of the company’s latest move to trim its workforce amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence. The cuts are expected to be announced early in July, following the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions will not exclusively affect sales teams, and the timing could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. The company declined to comment. The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft told employees it planned to use third-party firms to handle more sales of software to small and mid-size customers. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said on June 17 that the roll-out of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion (S$102.8 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The company had 228,000 workers at the end of June 2024, 45,000 of them in sales and marketing. Microsoft often restructures teams and announces other changes near the end of its fiscal year, which closes in June.
