Title: Cisco Study Explores The Truth About RTO Mandates And Hybrid Work

ByMelody Brue ByMelody Brue, Contributor. As businesses navigate the post-pandemic landscape, the debate around hybrid and remote work has only intensified. Cisco’s Global Hybrid Work Study 2025 reveals key trends and tensions around workplace flexibility, productivity and enterprise culture — a landscape where technology, human behavior and leadership intersect. Cisco’s study presents a clear shift: after waves of return-to-office mandates, the proportion of hybrid workers has dropped from 62% in 2022 to 45% today, and 72% of organizations now require some office attendance. Nearly half of those companies have increased in-office requirements compared to prior policies. This trend correlates with self-reported productivity gains (73% of employees report higher productivity) and measurable improvements in retention rates and employee well-being. Yet beneath the positive metrics lies a persistent tension: 63% of employees would accept a pay cut for more remote flexibility, and this sentiment is stronger among high performers. Results from the HP Work Relationship Index align with this point, showing that 83% of global knowledge workers would trade part of their salary for better flexibility and autonomy. The responses of top talent in Cisco’s survey also offer important insights about attrition. 78% of high-performing employees would consider leaving a company if work policies were not flexible enough. The Cisco data suggests a significant disconnect between leaders and employees on the value of mandated office attendance. From the employee perspective, 77% believe that a lack of trust drives rigid RTO mandates, and only 39% of employees agree that those mandated office days boost productivity. This sentiment contrasts with employers’ perceptions. 88% of employers believe there is a strong direct relationship between workplace productivity and frequent, consistent attendance in the office. There is another disconnect around well-being, with only 28% of employees seeing these mandates as beneficial to their well-being, compared to 42% of employers. However, this does not mean employees never want to be in the office, as 92% believe community and collaboration are key aspects of office culture. Financial considerations also influence both employers’ and employees’ perspectives on the office, but in different ways. 57% of employers in the Cisco study cited real-estate and building-maintenance expenses as the primary influencer of their organization’s preferred work model, while 40% of employees complained about commuting costs. Being in the office does more than boost metrics; it also nurtures connection, knowledge sharing and spontaneous learning. The Cisco study shows that 76% of respondents (and 85% of high performers) say office presence has accelerated their career progress. Additionally, 86% of employees and 81% of employers see regular attendance as critical for advancement, mentoring and inclusion. To offer a personal example, early in my career at a Hollywood studio, physical presence in a collaborative office was a valuable part of my learning — and gave me opportunities to seize unspoken opportunities. These experiences, which would have been difficult to find had I worked from home, occurred when “collaboration tools” meant a fax machine, a phone or email. While today’s immersive solutions can address some gaps, capturing the full career benefits of proximity now requires intentional, well-designed hybrid workflows, not haphazard adoption of new devices. As companies seek the right balance of RTO and hybrid and remote work, employers and employees must also remain vigilant about proximity bias. Proximity bias favors those who are physically present, often resulting in them receiving more opportunities, recognition and even protection from layoffs. One study from Beautiful.ai found that 60% of U.S. managers believed remote workers would be the first to be let go in a downturn. Left unchecked, proximity bias can create inequity, restrict knowledge transfer and marginalize remote contributors even when metrics suggest their performance is equal or greater. I wrote about the potential for this bias amidst Amazon’s RTO mandates in 2023, and it remains relevant. This is a cultural challenge, not just a management one. Workers, especially those early in their careers or aiming for advancement, must be mindful of how an intentional, strategic office presence can create opportunities, learning and recognition that are harder to cultivate from a distance. Perhaps more importantly, leaders must prioritize data-driven objective performance assessment over face time. As Francine Katsoudas, Cisco’s chief people, policy and purpose officer, said, “When we make the office about mentorship, connection [and] career development, people understand the value of being there. But when we focus solely on the work, it’s a less compelling value proposition.” Generational differences are a significant factor in shaping preferences about, and satisfaction with, hybrid work policies. According to Cisco’s study, employees from different generations report varying satisfaction levels with workplace arrangements, but flexibility is a consistent preference, especially among younger employees. Gen Z employees strongly prefer flexible work, expressing the greatest desire for autonomy over when and where they work. The report highlights that Gen Z employees rely heavily on collaboration technology and are most likely to expect workplace flexibility as a standard. Satisfaction with “fully flexible” arrangements is higher among younger generations, with Gen Z and Gen Y (millennials) reporting greater contentment under such policies compared to Gen X, who are the least likely to be “very satisfied” with flexibility, even though it remains their preferred model. Motivations to be in the office vary by generation as well. While most employees across generations recognize the importance of in-person work for career advancement and mentoring opportunities, younger employees are less satisfied with mandated full-time office attendance. For example, only 22% of Gen Z employees are satisfied with being required to work in the office full-time, whereas 38% of boomer employees report high satisfaction with this arrangement. Technology and well-being are again notable factors. Across the full employee base, nine out of ten (92%) employees rate collaboration and a sense of community as top reasons to value the office. Still, younger workers are more likely to expect advanced digital tools and wellness support as a part of their workplace experience. According to Cisco’s data, 90% of employees value collaboration tools, but only 32% of employers invest in high-grade technology that supports flexible, hybrid work models. This glaring gap between what employees want and what employers provide is where appropriate technology can make a real difference. Realizing this opportunity, tech companies are bringing out new products to close the gap between in-person and remote work. At the high end of the market, we see deluxe immersive tools like HP’s Dimension with Google Beam, which uses cutting-edge light field technology, spatial audio and multi-camera setups to create natural, lifelike remote meetings. At a somewhat more accessible price point, the Cisco Desk Pro — which I use in my home office and love — brings advanced video, smart framing and all-in-one collaboration tools to the hybrid desk, making virtual interactions smoother. The two examples just mentioned are high-end solutions, and widespread adoption of products like these will be constrained by expense and IT infrastructure demands. However, a range of more accessible tools can help to connect remote and hybrid workers at lower price points. For example, I use the iContact Camera Pro ($189) and the Elgato Prompter ($299). These tools are designed to facilitate direct eye contact, allowing me to look at my screen or read a script while still making eye contact with my audience on any platform — including Teams, Zoom or Webex. By positioning the camera or script in my line of sight, I can maintain this crucial connection while also picking up on people’s reactions and non-verbal cues. This is critical, as a recent study shows that eye contact in virtual communication is as important as in-person eye contact for conveying confidence, building rapport and fostering trust among colleagues and clients. Many device companies serving this market have also made significant strides in meeting-room technology, which can help remote participants feel more seen and heard regardless of which device they are using. Advanced systems now include AI-directed video framing that automatically zooms in on the current speaker or keeps the whole room in frame without manual adjustments. For example, Cisco Webex devices feature “cinematic meetings” experiences so that remote attendees get a clearer view of the conversation — which, in my view, helps with feeling included. Many collaboration platforms also prioritize high-quality audio with AI audio codecs that can reduce background noise and improve voice clarity even in challenging network conditions. Yet regardless of the device or price point, a gap remains in the investment that most companies are making in technology to support remote work for their rank-and-file employees. Finding the right blend of flexibility, inclusion and high performance remains a primary dilemma in the modern workplace. The best organizations won’t treat hybrid work as a binary choice. Instead, they will design purposeful systems that blend physical and digital environments, maximizing human connection and personal autonomy. In a briefing at this year’s Cisco Live event, Katsoudas emphasized, “It is more of a conversation that we need to have with our people around how they work and how they’re at their best.” However, implementing such a conversation in a big organization (Cisco, for instance, has 90,000 employees) is a significant challenge. Leaders must leverage technology and data to create a culture of feedback and trust that can scale beyond one-on-one discussions. Companies should also be careful not to mandate office attendance simply for the sake of following a single standard, as this risks losing access to a broader talent pool and could compromise diversity. Leaders must design in-office experiences that deliver unique value, such as in-person collaboration, mentorship and fostering a stronger connection to company culture — just not every day. At Cisco Live, Christian Bigsby, senior vice president of workplace resources at Cisco, emphasized the importance of designing flexible office spaces, using the phrase “more wheels, less walls” to describe the approach. He explained that instead of creating fixed, rigid environments, companies should design offices so spaces and furniture can be easily moved and reconfigured as needs change. By doing so, they can also counter the need for larger office spaces and leverage smart-workplace tech to optimize the space they do use. Hybrid work’s success will depend on connecting technology’s promise with thoughtful leadership and personal agency. This ensures the benefits of advancement, learning and engagement are accessible for all, wherever they work.

Title: Why Paramount’s $7.7 Billion UFC Gamble Will Pay Off
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/08/15/why-paramounts-77-billion-ufc-gamble-will-pay-off/
Time Published: 2025-08-15T10:00:00Z

ByMatt Craig ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. In his first week as the new owner and CEO of Paramount Skydance, David Ellison has wasted no time differentiating himself from the previous ownership group. With a $1.5 billion dollar deal for South Park and a blockbuster $7.7 deal to land UFC for the next seven years, he has already committed billions in just his first week on the job, and may not be done writing big checks. But considering the company has struggled with profitability in recent years, recording an operating loss of $5.27 billion in 2024, it’s reasonable to wonder how Paramount plans to recoup the value for the $1.1 billion per year it will pay on average to the UFC, and whether in an effort to outbid competitors like Amazon and Netflix it paid too high a price. “On a standalone basis we struggle to see how Paramount earns back their investment,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note this week. “However, this deal does cement Paramount’s willingness to once again invest serious capital into the business in an effort to scale long-term.” Under the previous ownership of National Amusements, led by Shari Redstone, Paramount looked in recent years to shore up its balance sheet by selling or licensing some of its most valuable assets. In 2021, it sold the skyscraper that served as CBS’ New York headquarters for $760 million and later that year unloaded the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles for $1.85 billion. Two years later, Paramount sold the publishing company Simon & Schuster for $1.62 billion, and explored further sales for cable channel BET and streaming service Showtime that never materialized. Two of the company’s flagship shows, Yellowstone and South Park, were licensed to other streaming services for a cash influx. The 42-year-old Ellison—son of the world’s second richest person, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison—has already made it clear his intention to reverse that trend. On Wednesday, he told reporters that Paramount was no longer shopping BET and plans to keep the company’s assets intact for now. As he told the Wall Street Journal this week: “You can’t cut to grow.” Still, the money has to come from somewhere—other than the $290 billion net worth of his father. The younger Ellison has promised $2 billion in cuts, and significant layoffs are expected to occur before the end of the year. In the short-term it will be a tight squeeze, with the company’s streaming efforts being bankrolled by its linear broadcast channels. “Certainly for the first half of this [UFC] deal, CBS is paying for it,” says Patrick Crakes, a media analyst and former Fox Sports executive who worked closely with UFC during its time on the network. “Will it make a lot of money back? I don't know, but I don’t think that was the point. Paramount has increased its value with this deal by being viable. And this makes it more viable and important and must-see. So I would look for them to invest more in this area, not less.” Crakes knows firsthand what effects a deal like this can have on a network. In 1993 he had just been promoted out of the mail room at Fox, and was asked to load slides into the carousel for a presentation the network was making to the NFL, whose television rights were up for renegotiation. Fox eventually won the NFC package away from incumbent CBS by paying $400 million per year, seen at the time as vastly overpaying for football, considering CBS’ previous $265 million deal. During Crakes’ 23 years at Fox, he says he can only recall the NFL turning a direct accounting profit once. But because of the value and legitimacy the league brought to Rupert Murdoch’s then-nascent network, it was able to negotiate for better signal strength, channel position, and eventually build up a local station affiliate network that became enormously profitable for the company. While the UFC is clearly not on the level of the NFL, it does have a rabid fanbase that has proven it will follow the sport to new platforms. In his MoffettNathanson report, Fishman estimates that UFC could attract six million new subscribers to Paramount+, comparable to its first two years on ESPN+, with the potential for more because of the elimination of the pay-per-view model on its biggest events. Those numbers are a drop in the Octagon spit bucket compared to Paramount’s ultimate strategy, says Crakes. He, like nearly all media analysts, remains convinced that the current array of streaming services will eventually be bundled or consolidated into fewer digital offerings in the future. And that future is coming quickly. Just this week, ESPN and Fox announced a new streaming bundle, in the wake of the abandoned Venu Sports venture those two networks announced with Warner Bros. Discovery last year. By beefing up its content offerings, Paramount hopes to create a package that becomes not only indispensable for inclusion in future bundles, but also increases the share of revenue it can command. In other words, much like the cable bundles of 20 years ago, media companies are back to jockeying for carriage fees. Because live sports will drive most of that value, there’s almost no price too high to corner the market on an entire sport like MMA. Mark Shapiro, president and COO of UFC parent company TKO Holdings, says he has been hearing the rumblings that the sports rights bubble will burst since 2005 when he ran programming at ESPN, but has found eager bidders each time he has taken out rights packages. “The crash is just not there, it’s not true,” Shapiro tells Forbes. “You've got multiple platforms, varying strategies, linear and non-linear, they all need premium content and sports is the last bastion of unifying content.” With the addition of year-round UFC programming to Paramount’s strong seasonal sports offerings on CBS—including the NFL, The Masters and March Madness—plus entertainment brands like Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and the Star Trek universe, suddenly Paramount looks far more attractive as an acquisition or merger candidate. Or, given the backing of the Ellisons, Paramount could be the one doing the acquiring—especially given the makeup of Ellison’s new board of directors, which includes private equity veterans from Redbird Capital as well as Silver Lake’s Justin Hamill, who served for six years as the head of M&A at global law firm Latham & Watkins. “This is repositioning an old stodgy media brand into a tech-first, personalized content brand, one that could be an acquirer instead of a target,” says Chris Bevilacqua, a 30-year broadcast veteran and cofounder of Bevilacqua Helfant Ventures. “The question is, really, are they going to be one of those 4-5 services at the end of the movie?” That desire to compete against the biggest companies in the industry, and win, is one reason why UFC CEO Dana White was sold on getting Paramount in his corner. “They know exactly what they’re doing,” White told Forbes earlier this week. “The Ellisons are brilliant businessmen and they have a whole game plan behind this thing, so I love being in business with them for the next seven years."

Title: A laid-off Microsoft worker says his best career move was focusing on his side business instead of the corporate ladder

Eduardo Noriega spent over a decade preparing for the possibility that Microsoft would one day lay him off. When that day came, he was ready. In May, after 17 years with the company at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters, Noriega learned his role as a senior software engineer was being cut. He told Business Insider he's extremely grateful for his time at Microsoft. However, he started having concerns about job security amid the Great Recession when, less than a year into his role, the company announced plans to cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said the 51-year-old. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best shot at financial stability was building a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job at Microsoft. Rather than focusing solely on climbing the corporate ladder, he decided to continue working on a side business he'd started in Mexico. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made. "I decided not to put all my eggs in the career promotion basket, but to try to build something on my own," he said. "That's where I put a good deal of my eggs, and that's what paid off once I was laid off." Noriega is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who have been laid off in recent months. After cutting 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor-level engineers like Noriega. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Noriega to count on traditional employers for income. Instead, they may turn to working for themselves. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: When Noriega started at Microsoft, he saw three potential career paths. One was to dedicate himself to the job and hope that promotions and raises would follow. Another was to jump between companies every few years, gradually landing more senior and higher-paying roles. The third was to build a side business with the goal of someday turning it into a full-time job. Noriega said his lifelong passion for entrepreneurship — along with a desire for a backup plan in case of a layoff — pulled him toward the third path. When he wasn't working at Microsoft, he dedicated time to a software education business that he'd begun developing before he moved to the US. After a few years, when the business didn't take off as he'd hoped, he shifted his focus to an online piano lessons venture — but that one also struggled to get off the ground. In 2016, he launched NTSprint, a staffing firm that helps Latin American software engineers access remote jobs in the US and Canada. Noriega, who is originally from Cuba and lived in Mexico for several years, said his goal was to help engineers in the region land higher-paying jobs and "break the cycle of poverty" in their communities. Over the past decade, Noriega has poured significant time and energy into building the business. In the year leading up to his Microsoft layoff, he said his typical schedule involved finishing work at 5 p.m., then exercising, showering, and eating dinner before working on NTSprint from 8 p.m. to midnight. In addition to those four-hour weeknights, he said he'd often spend up to eight hours on the business each Saturday and Sunday. "I was working like crazy," he said. Noriega said working on his business outside work hours was in compliance with Microsoft's moonlighting policy, which he said allows employees to pursue side projects or businesses as long as it's done outside company hours, the business doesn't compete with Microsoft, and company resources aren't used. Noriega said he was transparent about his business with his manager and didn't face any pushback. When Microsoft laid him off in May, Noriega said he'd already been talking with his wife about whether he should quit his job and focus exclusively on his business. He said he was earning more money from the business than from his Microsoft role, and the long hours were taking a toll. However, he said he couldn't bring himself to resign — doing so would mean giving up a steady paycheck, excellent health insurance, and unvested stock. Noriega said getting laid off by Microsoft was likely very difficult for most employees, but for him, it provided the push he needed to focus on his business full-time. He hasn't looked for another job since. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." Noriega said he thinks people who have concerns about their job security should consider diversifying their incomes — whether through freelancing, consulting, or building a business. He knows this isn't feasible for everyone, but said doing so helped him blunt the financial and career impacts of his layoff. In his final days at Microsoft, Noriega said a coworker told him he "won the Microsoft game." "What she meant is that I worked hard for the company, but once I was laid off, I was not left empty-handed and in despair, rushing to get the next job to support my family," he said. Jump to

U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels in a quiet finish to another winning week NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels on Friday in a quiet finish to another winning week. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% from the all-time high it set the day before, as it closed its fourth winning week in the last five. The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with its own record, which was set in December, before ending just below the mark with a rise of 34 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%, though it’s still near its record set on Wednesday. The U.S. stock market reached all-time highs this past week as expectations built that the Federal Reserve will deliver a cut to interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. A disappointing report about inflation at the U.S. wholesale level made traders pare back bets for coming cuts to interest rates on Thursday, but they’re still overwhelmingly expecting them. Such anticipation has sent Treasury yields lower in the bond market, though they inched higher Friday following some mixed updates on the economy. One said shoppers boosted their spending at U.S. retailers last month, as economists expected, while another said that manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly grew. A third said industrial production across the country shrank last month, when economists were looking for modest growth. Another report suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is worsening because of worries about inflation, when economists expected to see a slight improvement. “Overall, consumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April,” when President Donald Trump announced his stunning set of worldwide tariffs, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan’s surveys of consumers. “However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.” On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group jumped 12% after famed investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it bought nearly 5 million shares of the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Buffett is known for trying to buy good stocks at affordable prices, and UnitedHealth’s halved for the year by the end of July because of a run of struggles. Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock slipped 0.4%. Applied Materials helped lead Wall Street lower with a decline of 14.1% even though it reported better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The focus was on the company’s forecast for a drop in revenue during the current quarter. Its products help manufacture semiconductors and advanced displays, and CEO Gary Dickerson pointed to a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment, which is creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility in the near term, including for our China business.” Sandisk fell 4.6% despite reporting a profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. Investors focused instead on the data storage company’s forecast for profit in the current quarter, which came up short of Wall Street’s. All told, the S&P 500 fell 18.74 points to 6,449.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 34.86 to 44,946.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 87.69 to 21,622.98. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose 0.8% in Shanghai but fell 1% in Hong Kong after data showed China’s economy may have slowed in July under pressure from uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7% after the government said its economy grew at a better-than-expected pace in the latest quarter. European stock indexes finished mixed before Trump began his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could dictate where the war in Ukraine is heading. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.31% from 4.29% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 3.75% from 3.74% late Thursday. ___ AP Writer Teresa Cerojano contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

US futures rose while oil prices slipped. China reported data showing its economy was feeling pressure from higher US tariffs in July, while property investments fell further. Retail sales rose 3.7 per cent year-on-year, down from 4.8 per cent in June, while investments in factory equipment and other fixed assets rose a meager 1.6 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent growth in January-June. Uncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over manufacturers after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days following a 90-day pause that began in May. The Shanghai Composite index added 0.5 per cent to 3,683.58, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.2 per cent to 25,216.45. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 1.2 per cent to 43,152.55 after the government reported that the economy grew at a 1 per cent annual pace in the April-June quarter. That was better than analysts had expected. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi edged less than 0.1 per cent higher to 3,225.66. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 8,909.20. Taiwan's TAIEX gained 0.3 per cent. Attention later Friday will likely focus on an update on US retail sales and on a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1 per cent to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1 per cent from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3 per cent last month at the US wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5 per cent rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for US shoppers as higher costs make their way through the system. G-Secs rally on S&P’s rating upgrade for India The data led traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2 per cent. Thursday's disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer US workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That's a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find. Iron ore set for weekly decline on China's weakening property demand But a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term. Big Tech stocks helped mask Wall Street's losses. Amazon rose 2.9 per cent to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns. Because Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company's. In other dealings early Friday, US benchmark crude lost 16 cents to $63.80 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 13 cents to $66.71 per barrel. The dollar edged lower to 147.14 Japanese yen early from 147.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.1665 from $1.1654.

Title: Most US stocks fall after a disappointing inflation update, but Big Tech keeps Wall Street steady

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — Most stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday after a disappointing report said inflation was worse last month at the U.S. wholesale level than economists expected. But gains for Amazon and some other influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses. Seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1% to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped by less than 0.1% from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3% last month at the U.S. wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5% rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for U.S. shoppers as it makes its way through the system. The data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. “This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. Traders now see a 7.4% chance that the Fed may hold rates steady in September, according to data from CME Group. A day earlier, they were betting on a 100% certainty that the Fed would cut its main rate for the first time this year. Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2%. Thursday's disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That's a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find. But a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term. The data helped send Treasury yields higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.28% from 4.20% just before the data reports’ release and from 4.24% late Wednesday. On Wall Street, Tapestry tumbled after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade New York brands showed it's feeling the pressure of tariffs. It detailed how much profit it could lose in its upcoming fiscal year because of tariffs and duties, and its forecast for profit fell short of analysts’ expectations even though its forecast for revenue came in above. Its stock fell 15.7%, despite it also reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Deere fell 6.8% even though the machinery maker likewise delivered a better profit than expected. There, too, the focus was on where profits are heading. It cut the top end of its forecasted range for profit this fiscal year and said its customers “remain cautious amid ongoing uncertainty.” On the winning side of Wall Street was Fossil Group, which jumped 29.8% after the seller of watches and other accessories reported better profit than expected. It also announced a plan to strengthen its finances, while trimming its forecast for how much it expects worldwide net sales to fall this year. Big Tech stocks also helped mask Wall Street's losses. Amazon rose 2.9% to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns. Because Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company’s. All told, the S&P 500 rose 1.96 to 6,468.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 11.01 to 44,911.26, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 2.47 to 21.710.67. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Asia and Europe ahead of a key meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. ___ AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.

Oracle has reportedly announced job cuts within its cloud division, reflecting a trend among companies managing expenses in light of escalating investments in AI infrastructure. Employees were informed week commencing 10 August, of their role eliminations, reported Bloomberg citing sources familiar with the situation. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Some of the layoffs were attributed to performance-related factors, although the division continues to recruit new talent. Reports indicate that more than 150 positions were eliminated in the Seattle region, which has historically been a key area for the cloud unit. Following its decision in 2024 to relocate its headquarters to Nashville, Oracle currently lists more job openings in Tennessee than in any other state. An Oracle representative did not respond to Bloomberg’s several requests for comment, and the complete extent of the job cuts remains unclear. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The initial report on the reductions was provided by DatacenterDynamics, a publication focused on industry news. In July 2025, the company secured a significant agreement with OpenAI for around 4.5GW of data centre power in the US. However; Oracle faces substantial financial commitments, amounting to tens of billions of dollars, to expand its server farms to accommodate growing demand. The company reported negative free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in May 2025. In a filing from June 2025, Oracle noted that it regularly adjusts its workforce in response to strategic shifts, reorganisations, or performance issues. The company stated, “These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring.” In response to the rising costs associated with AI, several major technology firms have implemented workforce reductions. Microsoft has laid off approximately 15,000 employees in 2025, while Amazon and Meta Platforms have also made similar cuts.

An Amazon worker affiliated with the Teamsters on strike at a company delivery hub in Maspeth, Queens, last year. The 2024 election was a referendum on democracy—one that democracy lost fair and square. As loudly and as forcefully as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democratic Party as a whole argued that Donald Trump posed a threat to America’s democratic institutions, he was reelected with both an Electoral College majority and the Republican Party’s first popular vote plurality in 20 years. The polls suggest many wound up backing Trump for economic reasons—as troubled as they might have been by his antidemocratic rhetoric and effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the hope that Trump could ease the cost of living won out over the warnings about his authoritarianism and the democratic abstractions that became central to the Harris campaign’s closing message. That was only partially the Harris campaign’s fault—by habit, we tend to fret about the state of our political institutions and the state of our economy separately. But our understanding of democracy, and our defenses of it, should be shaped by materialism—an understanding that economic conditions and alignments of economic power determine the extent to which the governed can govern. Our Constitution, for instance, was profoundly shaped by economic conditions at the time it was written. Troubled by the demands struggling Americans were making of government after the American Revolution, our founders designed a federal system that frustrates our ability to democratically address our economic concerns and other matters to this day. And money in politics today has made matters worse—on top of the Constitution’s antidemocratic design, corporations and the wealthy shape policy in ways visible and invisible to ordinary Americans on the outside looking in. Fixing the latter problem would take more than imposing new limits on how the economic elite can directly engage in politics, as important as that goal remains. Corporations and the wealthy exert their political influence through a variety of indirect channels, from the media to their social circles. This means that an ordinary American would still wield far less political power—and be far more subject to political domination—than a millionaire or billionaire even with major campaign finance and lobbying reforms. But another way to counter the domination of the wealthy in our politics would be to democratically restructure the economy—granting the American worker more agency and ensuring that economic power and resources accrue to more than a wealthy few in the first place. In doing so, we’d not only reduce inequality to the benefit of our political institutions, but also, of course, to the material benefit of everyday Americans—demonstrating that democracy is worth fighting for not just as a political abstraction but a means of improving our working lives. In the 1980s, the democratic theorist Robert Dahl posed a key question often overlooked in both our political reform and economic policy debates: “What about the ownership and control of economic enterprises as a source of political inequality?” Ownership and control contribute to the creation of great differences among citizens in wealth, income, status, skills, information, control over information and propaganda, access to political leaders and, on the average, predictable life chances, not only for mature adults but also for the unborn, infants, and children. After all due qualifications have been made, differences like these help in turn to generate significant inequalities among citizens in their capacities and opportunities for participating as political equals in governing the state. As Dahl observed, the design of our basic economic institutions—including the structure and ownership of companies—clearly matters. It’s plain that our efforts to tackle inequality will be incomplete unless we’re willing to address how they produce inequality to begin with. And beyond the fact that the wealth and economic power that accrues to investors and those at the top of firms is leveraged for influence within our political institutions, the subordination of workers is also democratically troubling in itself. We spend roughly a third of our lives at work and earn our livelihoods there. The decisions made in corporate boardrooms and on Wall Street often affect us more directly, immediately, and intimately than decisions that are made in Washington or in our state capitols and city halls. Yet most Americans take it entirely for granted that we’re not entitled to a say in how the companies we work for function. This should change. If democracy is desirable because it gives us a measure of agency over the conditions that shape our lives—helping us master our own fates rather than living as the mere subjects of the powerful or the victims of circumstance—we should work to bring democratic values into the economy. Though we’ve long forgotten it, the coming of “economic democracy”—and, specifically, democracy within firms—was once seen as an inevitable development by many thinkers and political figures, particularly in the first half of the last century. In the aftermath of World War II, for instance, the philosopher John Dewey predicted that the conflict would lead to a democratic revolution in industrial organization. “It is so common to point out the absurdity of conducting a war for political democracy which leaves industrial and economic autocracy practically untouched,” he wrote, “that I think we are absolutely bound to see, after the war, either a period of very great unrest…or a movement to install the principle of self-government within industries.” That didn’t happen. But for a time, the postwar economy did deliver Americans a measure of economic democracy—thanks to the growth of the American labor movement. While much of the economic growth and prosperity America experienced in the decades immediately following the war was spurred by the social and economic investments of a federal government much bigger and bolder than ours is today, economies are built upon the backs of workers. The drivers and the miners, the clerks and the cooks, those who build and fix and clean and carry, those who staff the factories and the shops—whatever politicians and their donors say about the wealthy “job creators” at the top of companies, it’s the job doers to whom we owe everything. And for generations, job doers seeking a greater share of the prosperity they produce have turned to labor unions. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, guaranteed most private-sector workers the right to organize and to bargain for better pay and working conditions. As a result, union membership spiked—in the 12 years after its enactment, nearly 11 million Americans joined up. In 1935, about 13 percent of the country’s workforce had been unionized. By 1955, that proportion jumped to roughly one-third of American workers. Beyond getting the American people a better deal at work, unions used that newfound strength to push the New Deal and Great Society agendas forward—by politically organizing and mobilizing their workers, unions helped win the fights for Medicare and other major programs. Both in the workplace and at the ballot box, unions played a significant role in ensuring that the gains from our economic growth flowed to workers and not just the already wealthy. According to one 2021 paper, increasing union membership alone likely explains nearly a quarter of the decline in American inequality from 1936 to 1968. And while union families earned 10 to 20 percent more in income than nonunion families between the 1940s and the 2010s, unions also made nonunion workers better off than they otherwise would have been—to compete with union workplaces for new hires and to keep their employees content, even nonunion workplaces wound up offering better pay and working conditions. The gains unions delivered for American workers should be understood as the products of economic democracy. After all, workers form unions by majority rule — either in elections administered by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or by an employer’s voluntary recognition that a majority of its workers in a given unit have signed cards to form a union. Once unionized, workers are able to exercise real agency through bargaining and to voice their ideas and concerns about work in ways that are protected by law. Naturally, the wealthy and their backers in Washington fought back against the growth of unions as quickly and as doggedly as they could. In 1947, over a veto by President Truman, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which imposed a laundry list of restrictions on union activity and included other measures to limit their growth. Among the most significant of them was granting states the ability to pass “right to work” laws, which are often framed as granting workers the right not to join a union. But American workers never have to join unions if they don’t want to—workers who don’t want to be members of a union at their workplaces can instead pay fees that cover the costs of the union’s bargaining activity on their behalf rather than actual union dues. What “right to work” laws actually do is starve unions of resources by ensuring workers in unionized workplaces don’t have to pay unions anything at all. The proliferation of those laws and the other limitations on labor organizing imposed by the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act put the brakes on the growth of the labor movement. And further disempowering it became one of the cornerstones of the economic agenda that formed in the wake of an economic downturn in the early 1970s—an all-out assault on the policies of the New Deal and the Great Society. Unions were tamed, taxes were slashed, government programs were gutted, government functions were privatized, industries were deregulated, jobs were enthusiastically sent overseas, and finance took up a greater share of our economic activity. Policymakers assured voters that these changes would eventually deliver economic freedom and prosperity to all Americans. But on the whole, this agenda made the wealthy wealthier and more powerful while ordinary working Americans struggled to adjust. The result has been steadily deepening inequality. And few changes were as dramatic or consequential as the fall of the labor movement. From its peak at roughly one-third of the American workforce in the 1940s and 1950s, union membership has declined to about 10 percent of the workforce today, including just 6 percent of the private-sector workforce. According to one estimate, the decline in union membership since 1968 accounts for about 10 percent of the increase in income inequality America has seen since then. According to another, when the impact on the hourly wages of nonunion members is factored in, the decline of unions likely explains as much as one-fifth of the rise in wage inequality among American women and one-third of the rise among American men working in the private sector from 1973 to 2007. Companies are working hard to cripple unions even further. Although the Wagner Act prohibits them from explicitly firing or punishing workers for trying to unionize, U.S. employers spend more than $400 million a year on consultants who specialize in discouraging or thwarting unionization efforts with a variety of tactics that skirt the edges of legality. And even when companies engage in flagrantly illegal activity—firing unionizing workers, say, or spying on employees who are organizing—the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot directly impose monetary penalties on them for breaking the law. That weakness has made employers brazen. In recent years, major firms such as Starbucks, Chipotle, Walmart, and Trader Joe’s have not just fired workers trying to organize but have also shut down entire stores with ongoing union activity, supposedly for unrelated reasons. And as union organizers know well, even when a union is formed, negotiating a labor contract can be a long, drawn-out process, thanks in substantial part to the company’s stalling tactics. This landscape, combined with the growing difficulty of organizing, has taken power away from workers and given an increasing share of it to executives and wealthy investors on Wall Street. In recent years, unions and advocates hoping to wrest that power back have united in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act—the most significant piece of proposed legislation for organized labor since the Wagner Act. An override of state right-to-work laws; a ban on forced anti-union meetings at work; a ban on permanently replacing striking workers; a ban on forcing employees to waive their right to class-action lawsuits; civil penalties for violations of the Wagner Act; and a presumption in law that workers are employees rather than independent contractors unless employers can prove otherwise—these and the PRO Act’s other provisions would be utterly transformative, making it easier to organize unions, bolstering their power, and extending new protections to all workers, both union and nonunion. Still, more could be done. Federal labor law could be changed so that a union is automatically formed and recognized by the NLRB once a majority of employees in a given unit sign cards authorizing one—without the need for a separate election. And workers should have the right to bargain over more in union contracts than “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment,” as the Wagner Act currently allows. Harvard Law’s Sharon Block and Benjamin Sachs have noted that workers have mounted internal protests at a variety of firms recently over issues like climate change and the injustice of Donald Trump’s immigration policies. As they argue, “the democratic principles that give workers a claim to voice over wages and hours similarly demand workers have voice in these other decisions that their firms make and that have profound impacts on the workers and their communities.” What’s more, the Wagner Act has never covered public employees or agricultural and domestic workers. Federal law should grant them the same labor rights as all other workers. It should also end at-will employment by establishing that workers can be fired only for just cause—a reform that would not only grant American workers a basic protection afforded to nearly all other workers in the world, but also facilitate the formation of unions by making it more difficult for employers to invent reasons for firing union organizers and pro-union employees. It should also be established that federal labor law, once reworked, should be the floor for labor protections in this country rather than the ceiling. States and localities should be allowed to pass labor laws of their own, provided they are at least as protective of unions and workers as federal legislation is. While these policies would surely rejuvenate and expand unions, it must be remembered that even at peak membership, the vast majority of American workers have never been represented by a union—thanks, in part, to a system that forces workers to organize themselves piecemeal, individual workplace by individual workplace. To broadly unionize retail workers as a whole, for instance, would require unionizing countless individual workplaces at a multitude of companies across the retail sector—an extraordinarily daunting task. Expanding the reach of union contracts could help here. Unions have at times been able to negotiate master contracts that cover workers at multiple companies. Labor law could be changed to help make those agreements more common—once workers at a few workplaces reach similar contracts, for instance, the law could have those contracts automatically cover other newly organized workers in the same region and sector, without each workplace having to negotiate separate agreements. Policymakers could also more fundamentally transform labor law by instituting sectoral bargaining—a system in which representatives of employers and unions come together to negotiate over and set basic pay and conditions for workers across entire sectors of the economy all at once. On bargaining panels, those representatives might craft and vote on agreements that (for example) set a minimum wage-and-benefits package for all retail workers in a given state or region, rather than waiting for workers to organize unions and negotiate contracts store by store. New union chapters could then focus on negotiating issues specific to each workplace, or try to push for even better pay and conditions than the minimums established by the bargaining panels. Sectoral bargaining has a number of advantages beyond being a quicker and easier way to improve things for workers than depending solely on traditional union organizing. For one thing, companies might be less resistant to improving pay and conditions for workers if all their competitors were made to do the same in a sectoral agreement. (As matters stand now, one reason companies fight hard against unions is that they fear spending more on their workers will put them at a competitive disadvantage against their rivals.) For another thing, sectoral agreements could address the now-common management strategy of “fissuring” workers in contracting arrangements and gig-economy employment by protecting all workers doing the same kind of work. “It matters not whether someone is employed directly, is employed by a subcontractor or by a franchisee, or is an independent contractor,” Block and Sachs explain. “If they work in the sector, they are covered by the sectoral collective bargaining agreement.” But perhaps most important of all, sectoral bargaining panels—each a kind of legislature governing work in a particular sector—would be a remarkable instantiation and expansion of economic democracy. And that would be especially so if all the workers in a sector could elect the union members who represent them on each panel. As dramatically different as sectoral bargaining would be from the status quo, the seeds for it have already been sown. At various points over the last century, the federal government established boards and committees with business and labor representatives to set or advise on wage standards. And in recent years, policymakers in states and cities across the country have established similar “wage” and “workers’ boards” to set or advise on wages and working conditions—such as California’s Fast Food Council or Colorado’s board for direct care workers. Efforts like these should be expanded and made more fully democratic—allowing for the election of worker representatives by workers themselves—on the way to true sectoral bargaining in America. Unions and bargaining are far from the only ways that we might build democratic agency for workers. Here, US policymakers should take a page from Europe—with reforms that would give workers a direct say in business decisions. One such reform would be to have businesses institute work councils—bodies of representatives, elected by workers, that are consulted on working conditions, firings and layoffs, and other matters directly affecting employees’ lives at work. While councils in most countries are merely informed of certain impending decisions, a few countries like Sweden and Germany have given their councils a degree of real authority over working conditions. Contrary to what skeptics might assume about the business sense of granting worker representatives that much power, research has shown that work councils have no impact on a firm’s profitability. If anything, they may increase productivity—perhaps by offering workers forums in which they can discuss and solve problems. That makes work councils a good supplement for traditional unions: They can address new or specific issues in the workplace atop the contracts that unions have already negotiated. They can offer workers a voice in workplaces where a union has yet to be organized. The fear that work councils could be used to manipulate workers—through representatives undermined, selected, or controlled by managers—led to the adoption of provisions in the Wagner Act that essentially banned them in the United States. But those concerns should be allayed by new laws mandating that companies put councils in place when workers themselves demand them, and protecting such assemblies from the interference of bosses (much like the Wagner Act’s protections for those trying to organize unions). Workers should also be given democratic power at much higher echelons of corporate governance. In some countries, companies are required, under an arrangement known as codetermination, to reserve for their workers a portion of the seats on their governing boards, ensuring that ordinary employees get at least some say in decisions that might otherwise be left wholly to executives and investors. Germany’s system is perhaps the most well known and widely studied. There, most companies with 500 to 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-third of the supervisory board that chooses and manages the executives running the company. Most companies with at least 2,000 employees are required to have their workers elect one-half of that board. And, as with work councils, research suggests that firms with codetermination are as or more productive than others. In 2018, Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required all corporations on the stock market to let workers elect at least one-third of their board of directors. This was followed by presidential-campaign proposals from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Warren would have required companies collecting at least $1 billion in revenue to let workers elect 40 percent of their boards. Sanders would have had all companies on the stock market, as well as companies with at least $100 million in assets or revenue, let their workers elect 45 percent of their board. Either way, the Warren and Sanders proposals would have applied to companies employing roughly 30 million workers. Under the Baldwin, Warren, and Sanders plans, employee power would obviously be limited. As is just about universal in all codetermination schemes, worker representatives would have only a minority of seats on each board. Still, granting workers elected seats at the table where corporate decisions are made would significantly empower them. Even with a minority of seats, worker representatives could deeply influence corporate governance by casting key votes on issues where other board members might be split, and ensuring that matters important to workers are raised for discussion. And they could use that influence to help bolster the democratic power of workers elsewhere—by pushing back against company efforts to discourage or frustrate union organizing, for instance, or by trying to rein in political contributions to anti-union candidates and groups. But even if workers were on their boards, companies would still fundamentally be accountable to those who own them— founders, executives, and anyone else owning company shares. For public companies, that includes Wall Street investors who buy and profit from stock sold in the markets without contributing anything whatsoever to a company’s operations and success. Shareholders can vote on corporate matters— including selecting company board members—and the dividends that boards decide to pay out. A company’s actual employees, on the other hand, are generally entitled to none of this. Unless their employers are generous, they earn nothing more from the wealth their work produces than their pay and benefits—no shares or income as their companies do well, no votes as shareholders. Even with all the reforms explored above, those wealthy or well-placed enough in the company to own stock would still be calling the shots. Given all that, workers should also be owners, entitled to an ownership stake in the companies they work for. Some already are. According to Rutgers professor Joseph Blasi, about 10 to 20 percent of companies on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have substantial programs where some stock is either granted to employees or offered to them at a discount. That includes corporations such as Alphabet (Google), Apple, ExxonMobil, Ford, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft. And at some private companies, employees can come to own a substantial proportion of shares. The supermarket chain Publix, for instance—one of the top 10 largest private US companies—is fully owned by its 250,000 employees and its founder’s family. For years now, the primary vehicle for achieving worker ownership at that scale in the United States has been the employee stock-ownership plan (ESOP). In an ESOP, a company’s stock is gathered from various sources and placed in a trust for employees, who receive an allocation of shares that the company can buy back from them for cash once they retire. About 6,500 companies employing some 14 million workers—about 10 percent of the private-sector workforce—have ESOPs today. Roughly 2,000 of them are wholly owned by their employees. And research suggests that employee ownership is both good for workers and good for business. Companies with ESOPs tend to grow faster and are more productive after starting such plans than they would have been otherwise. Privately held ESOPs are also less likely to go bankrupt, and ESOP workers are less likely to be laid off. While some might assume that companies with ESOPs would compensate for the stock given to employees by reducing wages, evidence shows that the wages of employees at such firms may, if anything, be higher. StudentNation / Ava Menkes Feature / Katrina vanden Heuvel and John Nichols Nevin Kallepalli Sarah Sophie Flicker From a democratic perspective, most ESOPs have one key limitation: Workers usually lack a direct voice in corporate governance as shareholders. Instead, ESOPs are run by trustees, who vote for employees on most matters (except major changes, such as a company’s sale or merger). Yet they can be structured differently. Employees could be allowed to vote directly on more matters, for example, or they could be given the right to control the votes cast by trustees. The tax and other government incentives and supports that flow to ESOPs could be amended specifically to encourage the formation of ESOPs of this kind. In 2019, Bernie Sanders proposed another democratically promising and ambitious model for worker ownership, inspired by an idea floated by the UK’s Labour Party. Under his plan, the federal government would pass a law requiring all companies on the stock market and all companies with at least $100 million in revenue or on their balance sheets to establish what he called Democratic Employee Ownership Funds (DEOFs), controlled by worker-elected trustees. Each company would then gradually place 20 percent of its stock into its DEOF over 10 years. And workers at each company would have the right to vote through their portions of stock in the fund, just like any other shareholders. In plainer terms, the Sanders plan would have given workers ownership and control over 20 percent of every major company in the country—every big corporation you’ve heard of and thousands more besides, employing some 56 million Americans. And their ownership stakes would entitle workers to both full voting rights as shareholders and additional income from dividends worth, according to one analysis, an average of at least $2,622 per worker per year at publicly traded companies. As far-reaching and transformative as Sanders’s own proposal is, evidence suggests there may be public support for taking it even further. In 2019, a survey found that a majority of Americans would support companies with more than 250 employees transferring as much as 50 percent of their stock to worker funds, making them halfway worker-owned and worker-controlled. Beyond ESOPs and the funds envisioned by Sanders, there are fully fledged worker cooperatives—companies directly owned and controlled by their workers. In a cooperative, the divisions between workers and managers are eroded or erased to establish self-government. Collectively, it’s up to the workers in a cooperative to decide what the business should do, and then to do it. The profits, like the employees’ responsibilities, are divvied up among themselves. The worker-cooperative sector in most countries is small. In the United States it is positively tiny—by one estimate, there are perhaps 1,000 such enterprises in America, employing some 10,000 workers. But cooperatives are nonetheless instructive, illustrating how much workers are capable of when left to their own devices—and how well democracy at work can function as a practical matter. Consider Spain’s Mondragon Corporation, perhaps the best-known collection of cooperatives in the world, which employs tens of thousands of workers across some 95 firms in a variety of industries. “The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers,” New Yorker contributor Nick Romeo wrote in 2022. “The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker, a gas grill, a car—were made at Mondragon.” In general, cooperatives—as large as Mondragon or much smaller—tend to be about as profitable and grow about as much as traditional companies, while offering their workers more job security. They do come with their own unique challenges— worker congresses, like all congresses, do not always work well, and full participation in cooperative governance can demand a lot from workers. But they’re a viable and democratically empowering business model, and we could do more to foster them. States can pass legislation laying out how cooperatives should be incorporated to help them comply with state laws built around more traditional businesses and secure funding from banks. Tax breaks and loans can be offered to help start cooperatives or convert existing businesses into them. And more worker-ownership centers, like those in Sanders’s Vermont, could be founded with government support to offer them resources and technical assistance. Pursuing the agenda described here would remake the American economy once again, this time to the benefit of America’s workers—reducing inequality, improving the conditions of their working lives, and dramatically expanding their democratic agency in ways that will pay off not only at work but within our politics. Empowering workers and the unions advocating on their behalf could hamper the anti-worker political activities of their employers. And putting more money in workers’ pockets could facilitate democratic participation—it’s much harder to be an involved and attentive democratic citizen, after all, if you’re not sure how you’re going to pay your bills next month. But economic democracy would bolster political democracy in another way. Democracy is a vastly complicated thing; like all complicated things, engaging in it well takes practice. Habits and skills, such as learning how to present and debate one’s ideas, when and how to compromise, and how to critically assess and synthesize different sources of information before coming to a decision, are critical for democratic life. Ideally, we’d be better at them than we seem to be today; we might improve if we gave ourselves the chance to work on such skills more often, between and beyond elections. Economic democracy—whether through participating in unions, electing work councils, voting as shareholding workers, or working in full-fledged cooperatives—gives us the opportunity to hone those skills at work, where we come together with people often very different from ourselves to achieve things big and small. Through work, democracy could be made more concrete to those who’ve come to doubt it—understood, materially, as the means by which raises can be won and problems in our daily working lives that trouble us can be solved, rather than as abstractions bandied about by politicians who always seem to promise more than they accomplish. In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump. We’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel. The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here? At The Nation, we know which side we’re on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all. Our independent journalism informs and empowers progressives across the country and helps bring this politics to new readers ready to join the fight. We need your help to continue this work.

Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Study computer science or related aspects of information technology, get a job at Chipotle? Artificial intelligence appears to be subsuming many coding and technology jobs, according to a recent gloomy article by The New York Times' Natasha Singer. "The spread of AI programming tools, which can quickly generate thousands of lines of computer code -- combined with layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft -- is dimming prospects in a field that tech leaders promoted for years as a golden career ticket," Singer wrote. Also: Want a job in tech? You need these skills, McKinsey study shows There are three ways of looking at AI in terms of career prospects. One is the job-killer, noted above. Another is to immerse oneself in AI development and oversight skills, which are in demand. Then there's a third option. AI may be the lever that lifts professionals' paths into the startup space, opening up abundant opportunities. Ultimately, it may help people more successfully launch and guide their startups. "AI makes it easier for founders to launch new enterprises, said Spiros Margaris, a leading global venture capitalist in the fintech space and founder of Margaris Ventures. Margaris shared his perspectives on startup opportunities with us. "With the right large language models and data skills on your team, you can automate a significant portion of your operations, test ideas faster, spend less, and reach profitability sooner, if customers like what you're offering." Also: Can you build a billion-dollar business with only AI agents (yet)? This author thinks so AI could help wring out some of the risk that accompanies launching one's own venture -- the fear factor that stops people in their tracks from leaving the formal job market. Almost half of the one million startups started annually within the US will fail within the first five years, according to tracking data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Eventually, up to 90% will fail, due to competition, misguided product strategies, or overwhelming costs. AI's greatest advantage for testing new business ideas is speed. "What used to take months or years can now be prototyped and tested in weeks," Margaris said. "Just as we saw with fintech democratizing the financial industry, we're seeing the same with AI. It allows smaller players to level the playing field against large corporations by providing capabilities that previously required deep pockets, investments that only large corporations could afford. Now, thanks to AI innovations, these capabilities are accessible with far fewer resources." At this point, AI should be at the core of most, if not all, startups, he added. "Many startups were already using AI in some form before ChatGPT changed the game. Even those not using it yet are figuring out how to integrate it into their strategy. If you want to survive, grow, and raise money, becoming AI-first isn't optional anymore." Also: A year after Altman said superintelligence was imminent, GPT-5 is all we get? AI is being leveraged everywhere in today's startup scene. "Fraud detection, marketing, e-commerce, hiring, coding, you name it," said Margaris. "Machine learning was already in play before OpenAI reset our expectations of what's possible. Look at Meta's recent numbers: No matter how massive AI spending seems, it's only going up, and the payoff is coming faster than most industry observers thought possible. As AI advances its capabilities, startups will continue finding innovative ways to use the technology to their benefit and ultimately ours." There are even observers who say it's possible for an individual -- or very small team -- to build a billion-dollar business with now widely available AI tools. At the same time, AI adds more complexity to startup scenarios, said Margaris. "AI isn't a free lunch, even if it feels magical when it works. It can reduce risk, help with compliance, and improve auditability, but it can also create new headaches. It's two sides of the same coin." He added that cybersecurity also needs to be at the forefront of new ventures. "The threats are getting sharper as AI is used both to defend and attack. That's a fight every startup must be ready for, and it will only become more complex with issues like intellectual property disputes and data privacy regulations." Also: The AI complexity paradox: More productivity, more responsibilities Margaris has advice for those wishing to start a new business and how AI can help. "Build a team that understands AI, data science, governance, and ethics. Never lose sight of the AI regulatory environment, which could have a profoundly negative impact on your business if you don't monitor it closely." Importantly, "tools don't win; people do," he said. "A great driver will beat a good one in the same car. It's the same with AI. The right team and mindset make all the difference. My advice? Dive in and start experimenting now. If you hesitate, your competitors won't and they'll capture your market before you've even started."

August 13, 2025 09:49 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.

[Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Jobs at stake: Legislation could shield employees facing an AI threat

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. On the heels of news of layoffs at an Indian information technology (IT) behemoth that may be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI), a private member’s bill to protect employees from the use of AI in the workplace has been presented in the Rajya Sabha by Trinamool Congress member Mausam Noor. This Artificial Intelligence (Protection of Rights of Employees) Bill is narrower in scope than its European counterpart, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which intends to cover AI risks in general. The Indian private member’s bill, in contrast, focuses squarely on employee rights in the workplace. Also Read: The AI revolution could leave women even further behind. Here's how. To understand the need for such legislation, look no further than US tech giants. Amazon, for example, has been developing machine learning algorithms since 2014 for warehouse logistics, pricing decisions, etc. One of these works as a recruitment tool by scoring candidates on a scale of one to five stars and then picking the top resume from the hundreds received for every Amazon job. In 2015, the company discovered that its algorithm favoured male candidates, as it had been trained on successful resumes of the preceding 10 years, which were mostly of male applicants. The algorithm had ‘learnt’ that male candidates were preferred. Resumes of women with pursuits such as ‘chess’ or ‘debate’ were given an even more unfavourable rating. Although Amazon initially tried to amend its algorithm, it ultimately abandoned the project. The Indian bill attempts to tackle this problem by proposing the “mitigation of biases in AI algorithms that may adversely affect employees’ rights or opportunities by regular conduct of performance audits and impact assessment." Also Read: Outrage over AI is pointless if we’re clueless about AI models Additionally, it attempts to replicate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose Article 22 provides that “the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her." In this context, the Indian bill’s text requires ‘consent’ to be obtained from an employee whose data is to be utilized. While it is a step in the right direction, the bill in its current form faces challenges. Audit and overview: The Indian bill mandates organizations to conduct an Equality Impact Assessment at five-year intervals to ensure “fairness, non-discrimination, and compliance with established rules and regulations." A five-year period in the context of AI development is like an eternity. The EU’s AI Act requires the registration of any ‘high risk’ AI system to increase transparency. Such timely registration in India would be a good idea. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Consent: India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) emphasizes consent as the primary enabler of personal data processing. The Trinamool member’s AI bill too mandates ‘explicit’ consent in writing from employees who would be affected by an AI algorithm. But achieving explicit consent in a country as economically and educationally diverse as India would pose employers a challenge. While the DPDPA suggests the use of ‘consent managers’ to ensure consensual flow of personal data between data subjects and fiduciaries, how employers could ensure explicit and continued consent remains unclear. Employer versus employee rights: The DPDPA grants employers the right to process employee data for ‘legitimate uses’: “for the purposes of employment or those related to safeguarding the employer from loss or liability, such as prevention of corporate espionage, maintenance of confidentiality of trade secrets, intellectual property, classified information or provision of any service or benefit sought by a Data Principal who is an employee." Conversely, the AI bill under discussion requires Indian authorities to protect the rights of employees where they “refuse tasks or decisions solely based on AI-generated processes if they feel these violate their rights or ethical standards." It also grants them the right to review high-risk decisions made by AI processes, affording them an opportunity to “challenge choices or decisions adversely impacting their employment." A possible clash is envisaged between the rights of an employer that wants to use employee data and the rights of employees who want such data removed. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech AI implementation for payroll reduction: Perhaps to address concerns around impending layoffs arising from the adoption of AI-based models by Indian businesses, the proposed legislation requires the provision of “adequate training and up-skilling opportunities for employees affected by AI implementation" to ensure that “they can effectively adapt and engage with the technology." Given that AI models are often inducted by employers to reduce their payroll costs, it would be counter-intuitive to require organizations to incur expenditure on those it may intend to retrench. While well-intended, this clause would result in additional business expenditure. The AI bill proposed by Mausam Noor, while more narrowly focused than its EU counterpart, attempts to provide a crucial legal foundation for safeguarding employee rights in the face of increasing AI integration in the workplace and aims to address concerns about job security, discrimination and privacy. It also underscores the need for transparent, fair and human-centric AI development and deployment in a relatively labour-intensive economy such as ours. The author is an independent privacy lawyer.

Title: Are return-to-work orders, layoffs driving moms from workforce?
URL: https://www.deseret.com/family/2025/08/12/layoffs-child-care-job-flexibility-driving-moms-from-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T21:27:50Z
Full Content:
A significant number of working moms are heading home and an analysis in The Washington Post says a dearth of child care and job layoffs are together driving the exodus. Per the Post, “The share of working mothers age 25 to 44 with young children has fallen nearly every month this year, dropping by nearly 3 percentage points between January and June, to the lowest level in more than three years,” based on an analysis of federal data by Misty Heggeness, a professor at the University of Kansas and former principal economist at the Census Bureau. Working moms got some of the credit for the job market’s post-pandemic comeback, the Post reported. But that’s changing as remote work and flexible schedules are disappearing and government layoffs have sent many others home. According to the Labor Department, roughly 212,000 women older than 20 have stopped working or seeking jobs since January. There’s an especially big drop for Black women and those ages 25 to 34, per the data. “The U.S. is the only advanced economy that’s had declining female labor force participation in the last 20 years, and a lot of that is because of lack of social safety net and caregiving supports,” Kate Bahn, chief economist at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told the Post. She called it a long-term trend that appears to be worsening. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that 57.1% of women 16 and older were in the workforce. Among those 20 and over, the share was 58.9%, compared to 70.5% of men. Time reported that 212,000 women age 20 and over have left the workforce this year, noting that “by contrast, 44,000 men have entered the workforce since January.” That article, too, quoted Heggeness. She said that between January and June, labor force participation for women ages 25 to 44 who lived with a child younger than 5 fell almost 3 percentage points, to 55.9%. “It’s a big reversal,” per Time. “The participation of those women had soared in 2022, 2023 and 2024, peaking in January 2025, as flexible work policies helped women join the workforce and generate much-needed income for their families.” The federal government ordered workers back to the office five days a week in January and so did some big companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan and AT&T. The Flex Index reported that just under a quarter of Fortune 500 companies had returned to in-office, full-time staffing by the end of the second quarter. The index tracks trends in remote work. Still, the index said just one-third of companies require everyone to work in the office; most still have hybrid work arrangements. But 43% of those are structured, with most requiring three days in the office and allowing two days remote. The index also notes that a “clear compliance gap exists.” Attendance has in some cases been low. Structured hybrid is common with large companies, while small companies tend toward flexible schedules. Julie Vogtman of National Women’s Law Center told Time that it’s “not a coincidence that women’s participation in the workforce is falling as flexibility disappears. Women capitalized on remote work and flexibility during the pandemic and stopped exiting the labor force. Now many are not able to do so.” “Women still take on the lion’s share of caregiving responsibilities, and they are more likely than men to be navigating how to meet those caregiving responsibilities while holding down a job,” she said. “They are also more likely than men to feel that they have to leave the workforce when their balancing act becomes unmanageable.” Time notes another reason women have left the workforce this year. “Some of the decline in participation comes from lower-income women in jobs that have historically had to be done in person full-time, even during the pandemic. Those women are struggling because federal dollars for childcare have declined significantly in 2025. That money helped many centers stay open and charge lower tuition than they otherwise would have. That funding ended in September 2024, forcing many centers to close or raise tuition, leaving some families without options." Correction: An earlier version of this story got Julie Vogtman’s first name wrong. The story has been updated.

Title: Amazon exploiting visa programs to replace U.S. workers

Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:41:20Z

By Amanda Bartolotta August 12, 2025 For the graduates who cannot find jobs and the laid-off tech workers still searching for work, it can feel demeaning to hear Big Tech companies continue to claim there is a labor shortage when, in reality, there are more than enough willing and able Americans ready to step in. The repeated message that there are “no qualified Americans” does more than insult them: It leaves lasting damage that cannot be undone by simply finding new employment. However, Big Tech’s claims do not stand up to actual documented evidence. In fact, Amazon’s own filings with the U.S. Department of Labor comprise a comprehensive record of the company’s immigration submissions. And that data dismantles the “shortage” narrative, revealing a system in which loopholes are used, recruitment requirements minimized and federal certifications freely obtained for foreign labor – even as qualified Americans are sidelined. Between 2009 and 2024, Amazon filed more than 111,000 petitions for H-1B visas, a program intended for positions requiring “specialized knowledge” that cannot be filled by any qualified U.S. workers. Of these filings, 39,012 were new H-1B visa applications, while 72,726 were renewal applications for existing foreign workers. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! In addition to its H-1B activity, Amazon also made extensive use of the Department of Labor’s Program Electronic Review Management, or PERM, process. Between 2020 and 2024, the company filed 21,012 labor certification applications through PERM, an essential step for sponsoring foreign workers for permanent residency in the United States. How does the PERM process work? The PERM program is the first step in sponsoring a foreign worker for a U.S. green card (permanent residence). Before applying, an employer must test the labor market to determine if there are any qualified, willing and available U.S. workers for the job. That is the U.S. Department of Labor’s process for requiring employers to show they made a genuine effort to hire an American before receiving approval to sponsor a foreign worker. Yes, despite Amazon tech jobs being highly sought after by Americans, the company claimed that for all 21,012 roles, no qualified U.S. workers applied – essentially asserting that only the foreign workers they hired were interested in, or qualified for, those positions. Regulation on Qualifications for the Job: The batch advantage: Circumventing the law and regulations to avoid hiring Americans Wage-level “batching” is when a company reuses the same government-issued prevailing wage determination for multiple green card applications instead of getting a fresh wage review for each job. In Amazon’s case, the company obtained only 3,875 wage determinations but used them to file 21,012 applications, allowing Amazon to lock in older, lower wage rates, keep salaries down and push applications through faster while doing less recruitment for each role. About 82% of Amazon’s green card applications reused wage determinations, meaning the vast majority did not have a wage rate specific to that job. How much could Amazon save by paying below-market wages? It’s all about cheaper labor, not skilled labor This estimate is calculated by comparing the true median wages for these roles, sourced from multiple independent wage datasets, to the prevailing wage rates Amazon used when sponsoring green cards. The methodology assumes that for each job level, the difference between the market median and the prevailing wage represents the per-position savings, multiplied by the number of positions at that level. Level 1 wages: $285 million saved Level 2 wages: $434 million saved Level 3 wages: $20 million saved Total estimated savings: Over $739 million These figures are conservative estimates, while the real savings could be significantly higher. Under the prevailing wage system, the “or similarly employed” provision requires employers to use whichever is higher: the local average wage for the occupation or the wage paid to workers in similar roles. In Big Tech, market rates are typically far above local averages. If Amazon had followed this rule as intended, many roles would have been pegged to the higher Big Tech pay scale, not the lower local rate Amazon appears to have used. This suggests Amazon did not apply the provision as required, allowing it to lock in far lower wages than the market rate for similar work in their industry. Department of Labor: Prevailing Wage Information and Resources: While Amazon claims there were no qualified Americans for these roles and that the foreign workers sponsored were on “high-skilled” visas, the overwhelming use of Prevailing Wage Levels 1 and 2 tells a different story. These wage levels are typically reserved for entry-level workers with little or no experience, such as recent college graduates. This means Amazon is either abusing the prevailing wage system or abusing the visa program itself. By sponsoring these workers at entry-level rates, Amazon not only undercuts wages for equivalent American jobs, but also eliminates opportunities for U.S. graduates and early-career professionals. Once these foreign workers obtain permanent residency, they remain permanently in an already oversaturated labor market, further reducing opportunities for Americans. Amazon’s recruitment tactics: Can’t find qualified Americans … or not looking? The lawis clear: When sponsoring a foreign worker for a green card, an employer must recruit in good faith and advertise the job in a way that gives qualified U.S. workers a real, fair chance to apply. The regulations require open, accessible recruitment that mirrors how the company normally hires. Amazon’s approach has undermined that requirement. For example, the company ran vague newspaper ads in the The Seattle Times’ Sunday print edition, sometimes saying the job could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” but requiring applicants to mail in paper resumes, rather than applying online through Amazon’s own career site. Is this legal? The Department of Justice previously sued Facebook for using similar tactics, resulting in a $14.25 million settlement in 2021. According to the DOJ’s press release about the case: “Facebook routinely reserved jobs for temporary visa holders through the PERM process. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that, in contrast to its standard recruitment practices, Facebook used recruiting methods designed to deter U.S. workers from applying to certain positions, such as requiring applications to be submitted by mail only.” How 1 little ad was used to give 585 American jobs to foreign workers Recruitment batching is a tactic whereby a company uses a single, minimal recruitment effort, such as one newspaper ad, to satisfy the Department of Labor’s PERM recruitment requirement for hundreds of different jobs at once. Instead of advertising and recruiting separately for each open position, the company “batches” them together under one generic posting, often with vague descriptions and outdated application methods that discourage real applicants. This allows the employer to claim it “tested the labor market” without ever giving qualified Americans a meaningful opportunity to apply. Amazon has used this strategy repeatedly. In one case, the company ran a single ad in the Seattle Times for “multiple positions,” listed no clear skills or experience requirements, claimed the jobs could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” and required resumes to be postal mailed in, completely bypassing Amazon’s own career website. That single ad was used to justify 585 PERM filings for Software Development Engineer II roles. Similar examples show the scale of batching: This approach violates both the spirit and potentially the letter of the law, both in terms of 20 CFR § 656.10(c) (bona fide job requirements) and 20 CFR § 656.17(e) (good faith recruitment), as well as the BALCA precedent, which has repeatedly held that mail-only applications, generic ads and recycled prevailing wage determinations undermine recruitment integrity. In plain terms, Amazon’s “batching” is not legitimate recruitment, but it has been very successful in avoiding hiring Americans. Regulation on Attestations: Finding that employers placed unjustified hurdles in the path of U.S. applicants in an apparent attempt to discourage their pursuit of the jobs. Out with the Americans. In with the foreign labor During Amazon’s largest reported layoff on Nov. 16, 2022, which affected approximately 10,000 employees, the company submitted 2,341 PERM labor certification applications within the federally protected period designed to prevent the displacement of U.S. workers. On each application, Amazon certified that no qualified U.S. workers were available or considered for the roles, as required by law. Despite the mass layoffs, the Department of Labor approved 2,217 of these applications, authorizing foreign labor for positions that may have been recently held by American workers who had just been terminated.

Email Address* A day after unveiling a major deal with Delta Airlines, Crunchyroll has announced a sweeping internal reorganization that includes layoffs in the U.S., new global engineering hubs, and role changes for staff. In a letter to employees, published by Variety, president Rahul Purini framed the shake-up as a proactive step to position the anime streamer for “scale and success” over the next three to five years. The changes include the creation of “centers of excellence” in the U.S., India, and Mexico, along with a shift toward regionally empowered teams. Purini stressed the move was “not a cost-cutting measure or driven by financial performance,” but rather part of a strategy to lean more deeply into anime fandom worldwide. The announcement comes amid a period of both rapid growth and mounting challenges for the Sony-owned platform. Since Sony Group Corp. bought Crunchyroll in 2021 for $1.2 billion, subscribers to its service have tripled to 15 million, and the number of new shows released each quarter has doubled. But the rising popularity of anime has brought fierce competition from the likes of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon, driving up licensing costs and making it harder for Crunchyroll to hold onto its corner of the market. Internally, the company has undergone at least three rounds of layoffs since the Sony acquisition, with staff surveys showing declining confidence in leadership. According to internal polling shared by Bloomberg, only 39% of employees recently agreed that management communicates a motivating strategy, down from 51% in a prior survey. Some current and former staffers have described the post-acquisition leadership, many from Sony’s Funimation division, as “out-of-touch” with anime fans and culture. Crunchyroll has also faced strategic setbacks. Its “25 by 25” initiative, aiming for 25 million subscribers by the end of 2025, appears increasingly out of reach. Plans to drive growth through video games and e-commerce have stumbled, with several game titles shuttered and its Right Stuf merchandise business shrinking since Sony removed adult products that had contributed to sales. Competition for top anime titles has intensified. Other top streamers have secured exclusives for key IPs such as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Tokyo Revengers, and Delicious in Dungeon, while major Japanese studios such as Toei and Toho have explored partnerships beyond Crunchyroll. At the same time, industry sources say rising licensing fees are squeezing margins. Despite the turbulence, Crunchyroll is pursuing new markets, offering subscriptions in India for about $1 a month, expanding dubbing into multiple local languages, and creating free, ad-supported channels on platforms like Roku and Pluto TV. The new Delta Airlines partnership, announced just a day before the layoffs, will bring over 50,000 episodes of anime to in-flight screens later this year, marking a high-profile bid to expand the brand’s reach. Whether the restructuring will stabilize internal morale and sharpen Crunchyroll’s competitive positioning remains to be seen. For now, the company’s message is one of optimism: doubling down on fandom, investing in regional teams, and betting that its blend of exclusive titles, events, and merchandise can keep pace with an increasingly crowded anime streaming market.
