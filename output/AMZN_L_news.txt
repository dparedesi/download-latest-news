Title: The Wiretap: CISA Staff Are Cautiously Optimistic About Trump’s Pick For Director

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster , Forbes Staff. The Wiretap is your weekly digest of cybersecurity, internet privacy and surveillance news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) President Trump has chosen the new head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Sean Plankey will take the helm, having previously served in the last Trump administration as director of cyber policy at the National Security Council, security positions at the Energy Department and Cyber Command and chief information officer for the Navy. Three employees inside the agency told Forbes they were cautiously optimistic about the new CISA director, who will be looking to steady a ship rocked by swift layoffs that hit a number of key projects, from securing elections to protecting AI systems from cyberattack. Over recent weeks, CISA employees, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, had told Forbes morale was low and concerns were high that important work was being hampered by the cuts. Two staffers and a recently-departed employee pointed to the Secure By Design initiative, which had major tech companies like Amazon and Google agree to implement procedures to ensure security in their products before they’re released to the public. While it remains active, a number of those who led the project have departed, leading to concerns that it is now understaffed, two insiders said. AI and open source security work has also been hit, as Wired recently reported. Plankey will be replacing the interim chief Bridget Bean over the coming weeks, should he pass through Senate confirmation, and two staffers said they’re happy someone with a long history in security is taking over. That Plankey is largely “non-controversial” and has worked across both the Pentagon and DHS should stand him in good stead, said one staffer. “I think most people are optimistic that we got a serious person with experience,” they added. The new director has yet to meet CISA staff. For now, one staffer said programs are getting ready to pitch themselves to Plankey to make sure they survive an “impending reorganization.” Many remain unsure how severe the downsizing will be, another said, only that it is coming this year. Meanwhile, after a restraining order was put on the Trump administration’s firings, CISA is having to re-hire any probationary staff laid off after January 20.

Mamadi Doumbouya for Forbes In some astonishing allegations filed in a northern California court this week, workforce management provider Rippling accused rival Deel of a corporate espionage campaign. The former alleged that the latter co-opted a Rippling employee to spy on its comms channels to look out for signs of customers switching away from Deel. The suit claims that Rippling set a trap to catch the rogue employee, saying it sent a letter detailing a Slack channel of interest to specific Deel execs. Within hours the suspected insider was searching for the make-believe channel. Deel has denied all wrongdoing. Apple has challenged a U.K. order that it open up a backdoor into users’ encrypted iCloud backups, but had to do so in a closed-door meeting at the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal. American lawmakers have raised concerns about the secretive, privacy-invading move. A sonic weapon was allegedly used against Serbian protesters over the weekend, as footage showed crowds fleeing what sounded like a low-flying jet. The government has denied any such anti-protest weaponry was deployed. Such tools have been used to deter demonstrations for years and the best known devices are the Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs), which are manufactured by Genasys. From March 28, Amazon is taking away Alexa users’ ability to prevent voice recordings being sent off to the tech giant’s servers. The reason? It needs to train its Alexa AI, reports Ars Technica. Google announced the acquisition of cloud cybersecurity provider Wiz in a $32 billion deal. A previous attempt to buy the company at $23 billion faltered last year. It’s Google’s biggest acquisition ever by quite a lot– the second largest was its purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2011. Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old Russian and Israeli dual national, has been extradited from Israel to the U.S. to face charges he helped develop the LockBit ransomware. Per a Department of Justice release, “Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States.”

Title: Streaming Viewers Are Willing to Accept Ads, But Not If They're Paying for it, Tubi Finds
URL: https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=168149
Time Published: 2025-03-18T13:53:43Z

As more and more streamers pile into advertising-led subscription services there are signs of a potential backlash among consumers with nearly 80% agreeing that if they’re paying for a streaming service, they expect no ads at all. That’s according to a new survey by Tubi, which also found that nearly half of Gen Z viewers found ads that seem misaligned with their own preferences to “significantly disrupt” their enjoyment of the streaming experience. Worth noting upfront that Tubi’s research, conducted as it is with The Harris Poll, is self-serving. The Fox-owned streamer, which claims more than 97 million monthly active users mostly in the U.S, is a largely free ad supported service. Nonetheless, the warning is there for streamers like Netflix or Amazon Prime as they ramp up ads and charge $6.99 and $8.99 a month for the basic with-ads service respectively. For instance, 81% of consumers told Tubi that watching ads is a fair trade-off for access to free streaming content and encouragingly for ad buyers 59% of viewers say they'd consider taking action after seeing interesting ads while streaming. This figure leaps up to 81% among Gen Z but there’s a catch: most ads miss the mark. 73% of Gen Z viewers though the ads they see when streaming “seem misaligned with my personal preferences.? This highlights a major missed opportunity for brands to create more relevant, impactful advertising. “Overwhelmingly, consumers see paid platforms with ads as a bad deal,” the report states. “Let’s face it, ads can feel disruptive, but they’ll be a more welcome interruption if they are relevant to the viewer and serve as a fair trade-off for free content.” The survey also reinforced the budget concerns of a subscription saturated target audience. Streaming is a sizable chunk of consumers' monthly entertainment budget – On average, consumers are spending $129 per month on streaming + cable which is $20 more than they spend on clothes each month $109. 56% of consumers say they monitor streaming services carefully, so as to not overspend, and Gen Z viewers are particularly cost-sensitive: 76% say they have or would end their streaming subscription over increased price. On average, viewers are juggling nearly 7 streaming services, with a mix of paid streaming services (3.9 on average) and free services (2.6 on average). Other frustrations that cause subscription switch-offs: removal of content (66% agree), irrelevant content (63% agree), tiered memberships (63% agree) and password crackdowns (45%, up 5% YoY). Two-thirds (67%) of Gen Z watchers have ended a streaming subscription because they finished watching the show or movie they were interested in – and there was no other relevant programming on the platform for them. A significant portion of Gen Z are looking to downsize their streaming use: 29% say they use more services now than they plan to in the future. It also found that password sharing is becoming a tricky social dilemma. Seven in 10 viewers told the survey that they wouldn't share their streaming login with a romantic partner unless they were seriously dating. “Why? Because like a toothbrush, once it's shared, there's no going back,” the report states. 44% of Gen Z admit that they've continued using an ex's streaming platform login even after they broke up. The unspoken rules of password sharing haven't got easier. More than half (53%) of Gen Z viewers think that password sharing has made relationships with family & friends more complicated, and 38% confess that they've stopped dating someone because their taste in TV / movies was so different. Tubi's conclusion: “Perhaps the era of the password pass around is over with viewers opting to keep their streaming relationships strictly professional.” In terms of content, Tubi found viewers favoring indies over remakes. 70% of US streamers want to see more TV shows & movies on platforms that are independent or from smaller creators (a 4% increase YoY). 73% of Gen Z says they prefer to watch original content over franchises/remakes; and 72% of Gen Z streamers wish they had more of a say in the type of content that gets made for streaming services. Tubi, the free streaming service owned by Fox, flew under the radar for years, but now the industry has taken note of its surging popularity. At NAB New York, Peter Kafka, Business Insider's chief correspondent about the TV/streaming landscape, talked with Tubi CEO Anjali Sud about the TV/streaming landscape and how her company is changing the ways that people watch. In the pursuit of catalyzing profit, large video streaming companies have been radically altering their approach to growing top-line revenue and curtailing costs for some time now, be it through layoffs, password-sharing crackdowns, licensing of catalog content to rival streamers, and, notably, the introduction of advertising tiers.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: AI likely to claim 14,000 corporate jobs by early this year as firm eyes cost cuts

Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce major Amazon Inc. is set to lay off 14,000 managerial jobs by early 2025 as the trillion-dollar company aims to cut costs. While this may not be a fresh round of firing, it may be recalled that back in September 2024 Amazon's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andy Jassy announced his plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025. A message from CEO Andy Jassy to the employees dated 16 September 2024 noted that he feels that the company can have a better organizational structure to drive the level of ownership and speed it desires. "We want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time," Andy said. LiveMint has reached out to Amazon for an official comment to get an update on any recent changes to this decision. "We’re asking each s-team (senior-team) organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day," he added. Speaking on the issue of improving efficiency, Andy batted for returning to work from office. "To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," the CEO's message read, adding that “having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted.” Reportedly, the company seeks to save between ₹210 crore and ₹360 crore annually after the said workforce reduction. These managerial job cuts will bring down the number of managers in the firm to 91,936 managers, compared to the current level of 1,05,770 managers. As of 2024, 15.5 lakh employees work at Amazon, compared to its previous levels of nearly 15.3 lakh employees, according to Business Insider.

Title: Amazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5B yearly

Amazon is set to cut around 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025, aiming to save between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. This reduction marks a 13% drop in Amazon’s global management workforce, shrinking the number of managers from 105,770 to 91,936. This move follows recent layoffs in Amazon’s communications and sustainability units, as the company pushes to streamline operations and restructure teams. According to Business Insider, the job cut is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s strategy to simplify decision-making and speed up processes. Last month, Jassy announced plans to boost the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. He emphasized that reducing managerial layers would streamline operations and enable Amazon to make faster decisions without getting bogged down by bureaucracy. In a note released Thursday, Morgan Stanley projected that Amazon’s plan could cut around 13,834 managerial roles by early next year, saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion. The estimate is based on the assumption that managers make up 7% of Amazon’s workforce. “Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion,” Business Insider reported. As part of this plan, Amazon has launched a “bureaucracy tipline,” encouraging employees to flag inefficient procedures that slow down work. Managers have also been instructed to increase their direct reports, limit senior hires, and review pay structures to support the shift toward a leaner management model. This layoff wave continues Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts that saw over 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The company has also pulled back on projects that didn’t yield profits, including its “Try Before You Buy” clothing initiative and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service. Amazon’s workforce saw significant growth during the pandemic, swelling to over 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in late 2019. Although numbers have dipped since then, the company is still recalibrating its staffing needs. Earlier this year, Amazon mandated that corporate employees return to the office five days a week. Some staff were asked to relocate to designated office hubs, prompting some to leave rather than move. Management restructuring is another key part of Jassy’s approach, with efforts to reduce layers between employees and leadership. This move places Amazon alongside other tech companies trimming their workforce. Layoffs.FYI, a site tracking job cuts in tech, reports that 81 tech companies have eliminated 22,692 jobs so far this year.

Title: You can't split a payment on Airbnb directly — here's what you can do instead

Up until 2018, Airbnb offered a feature that was a favorite among users: split rental fees. With a few extra clicks of your mouse or taps on your phone, you could invite everyone staying at a rental to pay their share of the fee and avoid those awkward conversations about who owed who how much cash or who already sent money through Venmo. However, you can no longer split payments on Airbnb. So, if you want to split the cost of an Airbnb rental, you have to do it the old-fashioned way — with a few exceptions. The simplest way to split the cost of an Airbnb is for one person to handle the entire payment via the Airbnb site or app and then have everyone else pay their fair share through Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, or any other preferred payment app. Most rentals will also allow you to pay a down payment when booking and then pay the rest in installments, giving you time to collect payments from everyone else staying at the Airbnb. If you choose to pay in installments, you can use a different credit card for each payment, which may be a good option if there are just two of you splitting the bill. If you're renting a long-term Airbnb, you also have the option of using a different payment method for each recurring monthly charge. If you're the one to lay down your credit card, you can also collect a large number of points, especially if you use a travel credit card. Unfortunately, Airbnb doesn't make it easy to split payments for a reservation if you're traveling with a group. Your best option is for one person to pay and then use an electronic payment service like Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, or Apple Pay to collect reimbursements from the other travelers.

Title: BI spoke with federal workers who voted for Trump — some have come to regret it

Good morning. The backlash Tesla owners are facing over Elon Musk has crossed the pond. Here in London, a man says he was aghast when he was confronted about his vehicle in a parking lot.In today's big story, BI spoke with 10 federal workers who voted for Trump. Months later, some of them now regret it. What's on deck Markets: Rob Arnott thinks the market's tech stock sell-off isn't over. Tech: BI reviewed a leaked ByteDance document showing TikTok staff being evaluated on their "ByteStyle" and more. Business: Needy hospitals are trapped in a cycle of corporate plunder, Bethany McLean writes. But first, some voters feel hoodwinked. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I feel betrayed. This is not what I wanted, to let everybody lose their job." That's what a two-time Trump voter who works for Veterans Affairs told BI. "You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. This is not 'The Apprentice.'" So far, tens of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs as a result of DOGE's efforts to reshape the federal workforce. With Elon Musk as de facto leader, the DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs — some of which have been reversed by court order. Just a few months ago, some of the workers impacted by the cuts may have been celebrating Trump's election victory. They voted for a better economy, lower prices, or more stringent border controls. What they didn't expect was an existential threat to their careers. BI spoke to current and former federal workers who voted for Trump — and some have come to regret it. "If I knew I was going to lose my job because Trump became president, no, I would not vote for him," one worker said. Betrayal. Anger. Regret. You can read what all the workers told BI here. For federal workers hoping to now pivot to the private sector, things might be tricky. Lackluster corporate hiring, a shrinking middle-management job market, and pullbacks by universities are making the route to employment beyond federal agencies trickier to navigate, BI's Tim Paradis writes. Federal workers also face a unique hurdle. Recruiters and career coaches told BI that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear. Adopting a key new skill might help them: translation. 1. Rob Arnott says the sell-off in tech stocks isn't over. "We're seeing the unwinding of a bubble," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told BI. He compared the current market to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and warned that the Magnificent Seven stocks are set to slide further. 2. Why China looks investible again. Just a year ago, investors fled the country in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, with the CSI 300 dropping over 45%. Now, the country's stocks are rallying, thanks to a pro-tech shift from Beijing — and analysts are paying attention. 3. Follow these leaders for sharp insights on recessions. Leading economists are bracing for a recession, although there's been no official call yet. BI compiled a list of the best commentators on recessions, and the warning signs they're watching. 1. Amazon's DeepSeek scramble. When DeepSeek debuted in January, customer demand was so high Amazon rushed to add the AI to its development tool Bedrock. Now, Amazon wants to promote its products as an alternative to DeepSeek and is telling employees to point out its privacy and security issues, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. 2. Meet the Palantir Mafia. The software company's alumni have collectively raised more than $6 billion for their own startups, which include the social-gathering app Partiful and the defense-tech company Anduril. See BI's list of 30 Palantir alums who struck out on their own. 3. How TikTok scores employees. It's performance review season for TikTok employees, and BI viewed a rubric to see how they're scored. Workers are measured on Output, Leadership Principles, and ByteStyles — i.e. a set of workplace values. If an employee receives a low rating, though, they could end up on a PIP. 1. How wealthy investors keep bankrupting needy hospitals. As Steward Health Care closed hospitals and cut corners on care, its top officers got richer, and the profits kept flowing to its private-equity owner Cerberus. Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure: Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes. 2. Older Americans on the shifting job market. Some are taking blue- collar jobs, while others are navigating unemployment. Many told BI that ageism, technology changes, and economic shifts have affected their retirement plans. 3. The ghosted generation. College app rejections. No-show dates. Job apps sent into the void. No one has been more rejected in both their personal and professional lives than Gen Z, writes Delia Cai. It's led young people to adopt a blasé attitude in order to protect themselves — and it could turn them into a generation of incredibly risk-averse adults. It's St. Patrick's Day.

Title: Developing the future workforce

Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said. (photo credit : Somchai Poomlard) Prasert Taedullayasatit, president of the Thai Condominium Association, said many residential developers have trimmed their organisations for a while based on weak market signals over the past few years. "The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said.

The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Title: On the anniversary of the dot-com bubble bursting, is history repeating itself?

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.
