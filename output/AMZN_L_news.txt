The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it. Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for most everyone but Nvidia Open source thrived in 2024, with AI models like LLaMA 3, Falcon, and Gemma 2 empowering developers to build without barriers. Meanwhile, proprietary overreach backfired -- HashiCorp's restrictive Terraform license spawned the popular OpenTofu fork. And while the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) sparked debate, it underscored open source's growing influence. When companies closed doors, open source opened new ones. Also: Open-source AI definition finally gets its first release candidate - and a compromise Arm processors continued their meteoric rise, led by Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite. The Mac Mini M4 made desktops portable, the M4 MacBook Pros redefined laptop performance, and the M4 iPad Pro rendered traditional laptops obsolete. Snapdragon turned Windows devices into serious contenders, leaving Intel in the dust. Arm wasn't just the future—it was the present. Also: 2 reasons why I recommend the M4 Mac Mini to everyone While X imploded, Bluesky soared. Its decentralized model, sleek interface, and user-first policies made it the social media platform of choice for anyone fleeing Musk's circus. Every time X rolled out a new policy, Bluesky gained users. By year's end, it wasn't just an alternative—it was the new standard. Also: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative Matter Protocol finally made smart homes functional by forcing Apple, Google, and Amazon to collaborate. Devices that couldn't communicate before were now seamlessly integrated, making smart home setups less of a headache. It's about time. Also: Matter 1.4 now supports more smart home devices and adds new capabilities Meta surprised everyone with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses that were lightweight, stylish, and useful. Hands-free calls and subtle AR overlays made the glasses practical, not gimmicky. For once, AR tech didn't feel embarrassing -- it felt innovative. Also: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me Apple's iPhone 16 proved you can still dominate with brute hardware force, even if your AI game is… underwhelming. The base model packed the new A18 chip, boasting a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and 8GB of RAM -- a serious performance boost that left Android rivals scrambling. The cameras? A 48MP main shooter and improved 12MP ultra-wide lens delivered stunning photos, even if the selfies still look like you. Also: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone) As we enter 2025, the tech industry remains a volatile and unpredictable landscape. The winners will continue to push boundaries, while the losers will struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape. One thing is certain: The future of tech is full of promise and peril, and the next year promises to be another thrilling ride.

Title: The Next Hot Cybersecurity Skill for Your Resume? Empathy
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/security/27087/the-next-hot-cybersecurity-skill-for-your-resume-empathy
Time Published: 2024-11-26T14:00:00Z

As layoffs ravaged the tech industry throughout 2024, two sectors kept hiring: AI and cybersecurity. Generative AI isn't a surprise; it's the hot new thing, after all. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, contains many subcategories that require either technical know-how or a historical understanding of computing and crime. I recently spoke with someone who's done a lot of cybersecurity hiring in recent years, Maarten Van Horenbeeck, the chief security officer at Adobe. He told me that creating empathy through skill diversity is his goal when hiring for Adobe's cybersecurity teams. We also talked about how his teams find and train new hires from not-so-technical backgrounds to provide a much-needed balance between the business and technical sides of the company. Cybersecurity subcategories such as cloud security, digital forensics, identity management, incident response, and network security may sound similar, but they all require different kinds of expertise. In recent years, experts have told me that it's hard to hire a person with 10 years of experience in the nebulous field that is cybersecurity. It's the reason why there's an oft-discussed cybersecurity talent gap that's leaving key roles unfilled at major companies. Van Horenbeeck said that many people want to get into cybersecurity, but they usually don’t get many chances to develop expertise while working their day jobs in unrelated fields like developers or corporate communications. He suggested that one way managers can find new hires is to consider applicants with diverse skill sets who can apply their past experiences to current security issues. Van Horenbeeck used his career path as an example. When he began working as a security consultant in the early 2000s, he dabbled in a bit of everything. From cryptography to forensics to incident response and even penetration testing, it all gave him a wide scope of the cybercrime landscape and how it fits into a wider corporate ecosystem. Today’s highly technical, hyperspecialized cybersecurity community lends itself to experts focusing on just one niche, which makes it harder to hire people with a broad understanding of a company’s security needs. “That's an area where I think companies like us have a responsibility to identify candidates that have potential even if they don't have that very broad expertise in the security domain," he said. “Give them opportunities to grow to find the area that they really feel best about and allow them to grow in that specific domain.” Building teams with people who only have security backgrounds has its drawbacks. “They don't always understand how a software developer works from beginning to end, and that lack of empathy can make things harder,” said Van Horenbeeck. Instead, his company hires developers or people with similar skills who are interested in cybersecurity. They then train them for a specific security niche. This practice is designed to create teams with empathy at the core of their cybersecurity strategies. Adobe’s CyberPeace Builders program also seeks to develop empathetic cybersecurity teams by working with nonprofit organizations. The program provides volunteer security support for nonprofits in need. “For me, empathy is the number one skill that we need in individuals that enter the field,” said Van Horenbeeck. “By having our engineers work with organizations that are so different from technology companies, I think they really get to learn about how their advice is taken in real life.” People who have worked in other careers or at other jobs will bring new perspectives to the team, helping the group solve problems that go beyond IT or software development. It’s wise in any career to have empathy and patience for people who do not have your expertise or skillset. Not every organization has Adobe’s resources. Still, if you manage a cybersecurity team, it may be possible to create your own experts with a commitment to in-house education. It starts with facilitating company-wide conversations about cybersecurity. “As a CSO, I am most successful when there are many different conversations ongoing in the company related to security,” said Van Hoorenbeck. At Adobe, the cybersecurity team offers opportunities for employees to collaborate with people from other teams through presentations, brown bag information sessions, and soliciting performance feedback from other employee groups. If your company is only looking for new employees on job boards or at job fairs, you’re missing out. Van Horenbeeck said it’s especially important to identify talented entry-level employees who are interested in cybersecurity. That means going to where those people are talking: Cyber conferences, mailing lists, or online communities like BlackGirlsHack. Another option is sponsoring internships with higher education institutions. “We look with these universities for people that may be a really good fit to join Adobe as an intern and then ideally migrate into full-time roles within the company," explained Van Horenbeeck. Adobe partnered with Bowie State University for an internship program in 2023, and other major tech companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft, have similar partnerships with schools around the United States. The best way to find talented cybersecurity employees or to become a security professional is to relax your expertise expectations and approach the career with empathy at the forefront. “Don't purely focus on cyber security,” Van Horenbeeck advised. “I would say look at technology as a wide field, and look at security as a specialization in it. That creates opportunities for you to move into those types of roles.” I review privacy tools like hardware security keys, password managers, private messaging apps and ad-blocking software. I also report on online scams and offer advice to families and individuals about staying safe on the internet. Before joining PCMag, I wrote about tech and video games for CNN, Fanbyte, Mashable, The New York Times, and TechRadar. I also worked at CNN International, where I did field producing and reporting on sports that are popular with worldwide audiences. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Educating a New Generation of Workers

There is a crisis in technical education. The golden road to a career has always been through a college education. However, this âgolden roadâ has developed deep cracks and is badly in need of maintenance. Postsecondary education is rapidly becoming unaffordable, even at public colleges and universities. Tuition has risen at a rate 50% greater than inflation. But thereâs a deeper issue. Beyond the out-of-control cost, there is evidence that degrees do not map to the skills needed in today’s job market, and thereâs an increasing disconnectâparticularly in computer scienceâbetween the skills employers want and the skills colleges teach. Employers are struggling with a related problem: keeping the people who are already on their staff up-to-date with the skills they need. Itâs common for experts who spend their waking hours working at the cutting edge of the technology industry to feel like theyâre falling behind. The trend has only increased in the era of generative AI. A graduate degree is an option for employees who can afford it, but it doesnât help employers. After spending a year getting a masterâs degree, an employee is unlikely to return to the same employer, let alone the same job. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Why, and more important how, are colleges and universities failing? And what can companies that need to hire junior staff and upskill their current staff do about it? Colleges and universities are rarely agile. They donât respond to changes quickly, and that leaves them particularly vulnerable when providing training for industries where change is rapid. The traditional CS major may be where colleges and universities are at their weakest. The pace of change is very rapid, particularly when compared to the career of tenured faculty, and the resistance to change can be especially strong when change is rapid. CS departments have adapted well to AI, partly because AI originated in academia. But many jobs require skills that frequently arenât taught in traditional CS departments, such as cloud development, Kubernetes, and microservices. Why arenât these institutions able to adapt to changes in technology? Professors spend much of their time doing researchâwell, in reality, they spend most of their time serving on committees. Thereâs little time left over to find out what industry is doing, let alone develop courses to teach it. Staying current in the tech industry is a bit like being a professional athlete: You have to train daily to maintain your physical conditioning. Entirely new paradigms rise quickly: cloud computing, data engineering, machine learning engineering, mobile development, and large language models. To further complicate things, topics like cloud computing, software operations, and even AI donât fit nicely within a university IT department. They require going outside to commercial cloud vendors, which requires expense accounts and budget commitments that arenât covered by research grants. No university has the computing resources comparable to Google, or even to a well-funded startup. Nor do they have experience building and operating highly distributed systems. Topics like microservices and cloud native computing present an additional problem: salary commitments. Can an administrator justify the salary of a senior faculty member who specializes in a topic that might be forgotten five or ten years in the future, even if thatâs what industry wants right now? Can the administration commit to paying a tenured faculty salary for 30 or so years if that professorâs specialty may be irrelevant long before they retire? Itâs less risky to hire adjunct professors with industry experience to fill teaching roles that have a vocational focus: mobile development, data engineering, and cloud computing. Using adjuncts to teach the skills that industry wants creates its own problem: an underclass within the university teaching staff. Itâs no wonder that I have heard professors say âCloud computing is a fad and not worth teaching.â Itâs no wonder that many faculty members see these topics as âvocational educationâ while theyâre trying to teach long-term verities: these âvocationalâ topics fulfill the needs of industry rather than the research community and are taught by faculty with short-term contracts who come and go each year. Itâs understandable that professors are reluctant to teach a subject that is based almost entirely on proprietary technology that can change with minimal notice. However, if thatâs the kind of expertise companies want, students who need that training will find it elsewhereâand if universities canât provide the training students need, they will lurch toward irrelevance. In a recent Wall Street Journal article, âWhy Americans Have Lost Faith in the Value of College,â Douglas Belkin highlights another issue: critical thinking. As Belkin explains, The misalignment between universities and the labor market is compounded by the failure of many schools to teach students to think critically. Professors compete for tenure on the basis of the quality of their research and publishing track record. Teaching is mostly an afterthought. Professors who earn tenure negotiate lighter teaching loads. To fill the gap, schools hire less expensive adjuncts with little job security. These precariously employed adjuncts depend on strong student performance reviews for job security, a system that incentivizes them to make few demands in exchange for high ratings. Any metric can be gamed (often called Goodhartâs law)âand grades are no exception, gamed both by faculty who need good ratings from students and by students who want good grades from faculty. Grades are part of the critical thinking problem, as is a dismissal of writing, reading, and non-STEM skills. Itâs not as if critical thinking isnât taught in universities. The humanities are nothing without critical thinking, whether or not theyâre taught by overwhelmed and underpaid adjunctsâbut humanities departments are the ones most threatened by budget cuts and, at some schools, outright elimination. Vocational skills are a necessity, whether or not CS departments want to teach them. Assessment is a necessity, and itâs something corporations take very seriously, at least for in-house training programs. But making vocational skills and assessment priorities risks letting grades become a motivating factor, and that is counterproductive. Is anything more conformist than aspiring to do what your teacher says to get an A? Or to build your academic career around getting a job at a prestigious, high-profile company? Students need to learn how to make mistakes. They need to learn how to push their ideas as far as they can and then a little farther. In my classes I encourage students to fail early and often. A failure is a desired outcome: It means they tried something hard and unique or that they learned a big lesson. Teaching students to consider problems from many perspectives, including those that are uncomfortable, is a necessity. Too many students graduate thinking that science is a set of facts rather than understanding that itâs a process of skeptical inquiry driven by experiment. Too many students think that engineering is about getting the answer in the back of the book, not about making the trade-offs that are necessary in the real world. And too many companies fail because they canât question their own assumptions. This is all critical thinkingâand anything less shortchanges both students and the companies that eventually hire them. Soâcolleges and universities are failing industry. They arenât providing graduates who are trained in the skills companies need; they arenât nurturing critical thinkers; and they are pricing themselves out of the range of all but the ultrawealthy. What can companies do to acquire and retain the talent they need? Understanding industry needs isnât a static project. In 2020, the World Economic Forum estimated that automation will displace 85 million jobs by 2025 but will also create 97 million new jobs. Another publication estimated that there were 13 million unfilled technology jobs. In the 21st century, churn is ever present. Whatever your job is now, it will be different in five to ten years: Your skills will be obsolete, and youâll need to learn new ones. Thatâs a problem for both new graduates and experienced staff, to say nothing of the companies that employ them. And as weâve seen, itâs an even bigger problem for colleges and universities. To start, weâll look at what companies actually need, using data from OâReillyâs learning platform. There are two factors: course enrollments, which show what students are studying, and course completion, which may reveal skills in high demand. The median course completion percentage on the OâReilly platform is similar for B2B users and B2C users, and roughly matches industry standards. A higher completion rate could indicate that the course teaches an emerging skill that is required in industry. Examples of these skills are artificial intelligence (prompt engineering, GPT, and PyTorch), cloud (Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Microsoftâs Azure AZ-900 certification), Rust, and MLOps. Itâs important to note that CISSP (the Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification is on the list; although security skills are hardly a new requirement, corporate attitudes toward security have changed drastically in the past few years. Executives donât like seeing their companies in the news for a security breach. Some other topics with high completion rates are ggplot (for data-driven graphics in R), GitHub, and Selenium (a software testing framework). SolidWorks is an outlier; SolidWorks courses have relatively few users, but almost all the users complete them. What are people studying? The previous graph includes all users of the OâReilly learning platform. What can we see if we look at B2B and B2C users separately? Thereâs a high correlation between completion rates for both types of users on the platform. The Pearson correlation is 0.8, meaning B2B and B2C users move together 80% of the time, but there are some important differences: Individual users (B2C) are learning about technologiesâperhaps to help in getting a new job or to acquire skills they need in their current job, perhaps to help with their personal projects. Users who are coming from corporate accounts (B2B) behave differently. Theyâre learning skills that are important in a business environment: communications, teamwork, project management. Also, keep in mind there may be outliers here like SolidWorks, which could be a course an employer requires an employee to complete. Linkedinâs research on mapping skills to jobs led the company to develop a skills genome. Hereâs how itâs described: For any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skills genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 âmost characteristic skillsâ of that entity. These most characteristic skills are identified using the TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., Microsoft Word). Essentially, this approach shows that you can rank skills by how often they show up in job postings. Skipping the math, hereâs an intuitive description of TF-IDF: Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a word (or skill, in this case) appears within a document or job posting. A higher frequency might indicate relevance.Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures how common or rare a word is across a larger collection of documents (or job postings). Common words like “the” or “and” receive a lower IDF score, de-emphasizing their importance. We can accomplish something similar by doing topic modeling on OâReillyâs data. First, we find the top words associated with each topic. Then we use zero-shot classification to map the topics to jobs. That process yields results like these: Cybersecurity professional:– Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.976– Matched Topic 2: [‘security’, ‘professional’, ‘certified’, ‘systems’, ‘information’] | Score: 0.918 Technology consultant: – Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.579– Matched Topic 2: [‘azure’, ‘microsoft’, ‘az’, ‘fundamentals’, ‘900’] | Score: 0.868– Matched Topic 3: [‘linux’, ‘gpt’, ‘artificial’, ‘intelligence’, ‘go’] | Score: 0.623– Matched Topic 4: [‘learning’, ‘machine’, ‘deep’, ‘design’, ‘driven’] | Score: 0.527 The job âcybersecurity professionalâ requires skills in Kubernetes (including CKAD certification), along with security skills. A job as a technology consultant requires a broader group of skills: cloud development, linux, AI, and more. âTechnology consultantâ doesnât match to topics as sharply as does âcybersecurity professional,â but it still gives us a good starting point. After a bit of data cleansing, we can invert this mapping to find out what jobs are associated with any given topic. For example, take the titles of courses, then map them to topics, then take the topics and map them to job titles. For example in Topic 1, the skills âAWSâ and âcloudâ map to the job titles cloud engineer, AWS solutions architect, and technology consultant. This result is exactly what we should expect, showing that this approach to discovering the labels of skills mapping to jobs has merit.Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 2 (Python, AI design): Topic 3 (Software architecture): Topic 4 (Kubernetes, developers): Topic 5 (Java development): Topic 6 (Microservices): Topic 7 (Security systems): Topic 8 (Microsoft Azure): Topic 9 (Linux, AI): Topic 10 (Deep learning): Topic modeling can play an important role in identifying job skills based on the topics learners consume. This could certainly be used by educational institutions to give them a competitive advantage. It certainly is used by companies like OâReilly, which provide training services to individual and corporate customers. But more importantly, it provides valuable information to HR departments about the skills they need to hire for. For institutions that can make use of this data, it serves as a competitive advantage. It tells them what roles the topics they teach are preparing the students for, and can help them plan curricula that are more relevant to the needs of industry. A university could use this analysis to look at external trends along with internal course popularity. Students may have unique intuitions about what skills they need based on job interviews and internships. Analyzing alumni data could show what job titles their alumni have had, which could be compared with the courses those alumni took while enrolled. What does industry need? The course completion data shows that students from our corporate clients are looking for soft skills like management, communications, and product management in addition to technical skills. While this might reflect studentsâ desires to âget aheadâ rather than corporate needs, companies are aware that good communications and management skills are essential and not taught in degree programs. And, letâs face it, everyone wants product managers. Topic modeling shows that corporations are looking for cloud skills, software architecture (a more senior skill to aspire to), AI skills, Kubernetes, Java, Python, microservices, security, and Linux. Except for AI, Java, and Python, itâs difficult or impossible to find courses on these topics in college or university CS departments. We wonât name names, but we challenge you to do your own research. Most of the schools we looked at offered one or two courses on cloud computing (though nothing on specific cloud vendors); we were unable to find any university that offered courses on microservices or Kubernetes, though no doubt some exist. If you take up our challenge, we suggest that you look at the course offerings in your stateâs flagship university, one of its second-tier universities, a community college, and two private institutions (one prestigious, one not). The less prestigious schools are more likely to provide training in specific job-related skills. If colleges and universities donât provide training on skills that are important to industry, who will? Responsibility would seem to fall squarely on the shoulders of industry. If you canât hire people with the skills you need, hire good people and train them. But is training available on the job? Too often, the answer is no. Why is that? An increasing number of companies are waking up to the need for corporate training programs, but in doing so, theyâre going against the last few decades of corporate thinking. For years, the incentives have been wrong. Stockholders want to see the price of the stock increase and pressure executives to use buybacks and layoffs to maximize their stockâs near-term value, often at the expense of long-term thinking. In The Man Who Broke Capitalism, David Gelles notes, Before [Jack] Welch, corporate profits were largely reinvested in the company or paid out to workers rather than sent back to stock owners. In 1980, American companies spent less than $50 billion on buybacks and dividends. By the time of Welchâs retirement, a much greater share of corporate profits was going to investors and management, with American companies spending $350 billion on buybacks and dividends in 2000. Training is an investment in the companyâand itâs a kind of investment that has gone out of style. However, forward-thinking companies realize that an investment in upskilling their employees is a critical part of long-term strategic thinking. Running a company as lean as possible to maximize short-term profit has dire effects on training: If expenses are cut to the bone, companies canât help their staff keep up with changes in technology, nor can they prepare recent college graduates to make the transition to the âreal world.â In turn, a workforce that lags behind current technologies leads to poor long-term outcomes. A staff that falls behind the curve or never makes it to the curve to begin with will have trouble developing successful products for the future. Shortchanging training only leads to a company that underperforms in the long term. Historical evidence supports the value of skilled apprenticeship. Internships can be small âtiger teamsâ that allow students to focus on specific problems with a mentor. Although we donât hear much about apprenticeships in the 21st century, internships (and even PhD programs) share many aspects of apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are an ideal way to bring recent college graduates up to speed on skills they need. They are less applicable for more senior employees who need to sharpen their skills or learn new ones as the industry evolves. Itâs important to remember what senior employees gain from mentoring junior employees. When done well, mentoring exposes the seniors to new ideas from their students. It requires them to think through everything they already know; talking and explaining solidifies their own knowledge. Many companies provide in-house training programs through products such as the OâReilly learning platform. Products like these can be integrated with the companyâs own learning management system (LMS) to create custom curricula depending on their staffâs needs and track progress through the learning program. This kind of solution works well for both senior and junior employees: A senior developer may only need to get up to speed on a few topics of interest, like AI, while a new hire might need to fill in basic knowledge they didnât get in school. Critical thinking presents different issues. Companies in which everyone is indoctrinated with the marketing literature and the annual report eventually fail; theyâre blindsided by new developments because they canât think outside of their boxes. Critical thinking isnât tied to any specific topic or skill, like microservices, but it can be learned in any context. Recently, our learning platform has begun to introduce options for interactivity, including interactive quizzes, coding sandboxes and labs where you can try out ideas, and challenge exercises that test new skills. All of these learning tools help teach critical thinking. Critical thinking skills can also be developed by reading books, writing about what you learned, and participating in study groups. Another key to critical thinking will be valuing teaching as suchâthe kind of patient teaching or mentoring that doesnât revolve around grades or student evaluations but that understands that all teaching is a process of exploration. To build critical thinking skills, companies need to go beyond providing courseware. They need to build a culture where all ideas are respected, a culture that encourages discussion, exploration, and failure. The need to train, upskill, and reskill job seekers isnât being fulfilled. Universities alone arenât enough to meet the demands of a changing workforce. There are no shortcuts. Learning requires doing; it can be messy, stressful, awkward, and difficult. But without the struggle to learn, there is no future: not for individual job seekers and not for the rest of us who rely on their productivity. For most students, learning is a matter of filling the gap between academic study and pragmatic skills. Platforms like OâReilly bridge the gap in bringing cutting-edge skills, certifications, and knowledge to students. Tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology.

The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it. Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for most everyone but Nvidia Open source thrived in 2024, with AI models like LLaMA 3, Falcon, and Gemma 2 empowering developers to build without barriers. Meanwhile, proprietary overreach backfired -- HashiCorp's restrictive Terraform license spawned the popular OpenTofu fork. And while the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) sparked debate, it underscored open source's growing influence. When companies closed doors, open source opened new ones. Also: Open-source AI definition finally gets its first release candidate - and a compromise Arm processors continued their meteoric rise, led by Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite. The Mac Mini M4 made desktops portable, the M4 MacBook Pros redefined laptop performance, and the M4 iPad Pro rendered traditional laptops obsolete. Snapdragon turned Windows devices into serious contenders, leaving Intel in the dust. Arm wasn't just the future—it was the present. Also: 2 reasons why I recommend the M4 Mac Mini to everyone While X imploded, Bluesky soared. Its decentralized model, sleek interface, and user-first policies made it the social media platform of choice for anyone fleeing Musk's circus. Every time X rolled out a new policy, Bluesky gained users. By year's end, it wasn't just an alternative—it was the new standard. Also: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative Matter Protocol finally made smart homes functional by forcing Apple, Google, and Amazon to collaborate. Devices that couldn't communicate before were now seamlessly integrated, making smart home setups less of a headache. It's about time. Also: Matter 1.4 now supports more smart home devices and adds new capabilities Meta surprised everyone with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses that were lightweight, stylish, and useful. Hands-free calls and subtle AR overlays made the glasses practical, not gimmicky. For once, AR tech didn't feel embarrassing -- it felt innovative. Also: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me Apple's iPhone 16 proved you can still dominate with brute hardware force, even if your AI game is… underwhelming. The base model packed the new A18 chip, boasting a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and 8GB of RAM -- a serious performance boost that left Android rivals scrambling. The cameras? A 48MP main shooter and improved 12MP ultra-wide lens delivered stunning photos, even if the selfies still look like you. Also: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone) As we enter 2025, the tech industry remains a volatile and unpredictable landscape. The winners will continue to push boundaries, while the losers will struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape. One thing is certain: The future of tech is full of promise and peril, and the next year promises to be another thrilling ride.

Title: Elon Musk has big return-to-office plans for federal employees and he’s saying the quiet part out loud

Good morning! The return-to-office debate got a bit spicier last week with Elon Musk’s latest promise to make the government more efficient. In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, the billionaire appointed to head up the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) along with his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy, laid out plans to reduce the overall size of the government and cut costs. And one part of that blueprint included mandating a full return-to-office for all Federal workers. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote. In doing so, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to be openly announcing what some critics have long argued is a disguised impetus behind strict RTO mandates: Job cuts. One survey this year of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found that a quarter of C-suite executives were hoping that return-to-office policies would encourage employees to voluntarily quit. After all, it’s certainly cheaper than having to do layoffs and pay severance. Other CEOs have discussed potential attrition due to five-day RTO mandates. Last month, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told staffers during an all-hands meeting that it’s “OK” if people don’t want to work in an office environment because there are “other companies around.” That led many employees to sign an open letter to corporate leadership noting his remarks were “inconsistent with the experiences of many employees” and “misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back against allegations that the company’s RTO requirement was an excuse to lay off workers and said the decision was “not a cost play.” The Federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with over 2.2 million civilian staffers. Until now, each agency has been able to decide what workplace policy works best for them. Of the total number of Federal workers, roughly half work on-site, according to an August report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. While remaining employees are eligible for remote work, the report found that only 228,000, or roughly 10%, were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they work in-person. And those who have the option to work remotely spent about 60% of working hours in-person at various job sites. It’s unclear if Musk and Ramaswamy will actually be able to implement a five-day RTO for Federal workers. And of course, the question remains: Will these CEOs return to the office themselves?

Title: Will Trump’s DOJ Dismantle Big Tech Monopolies?

The Big Tech Titans: Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft face mounting scrutiny as the Trump ... [+] administration's antitrust agenda targets industry monopolies and reshapes the future of technology. November 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its proposed final judgment, recommending sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s search monopoly. This long-awaited action marks the most significant antitrust move in decades and could become a pivotal moment for Big Tech as President Trump prepares for his second term. At the core of the DOJ’s plan is the requirement for Google to sell its Chrome browser. The proposal also includes a framework for divesting Android if behavioral remedies fail to increase competition. Remedies include banning exclusive default agreements with device makers and prohibiting Google from developing new browsers. Unsurprisingly, Google is pushing back strongly and Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker called the DOJ’s plan a “radical interventionist agenda,” asserting it goes “miles beyond” the concerns outlined by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled in August that Google held monopolies in two markets. With President Trump back in the White House in January, speculation is mounting over whether his administration will pursue even more drastic actions against Big Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Such moves could reshape not only the tech industry but also the global economy. The incoming Trump administration has long signaled an aggressive stance on Big Tech, citing concerns about censorship, market dominance and monopolistic practices. High-profile figures in Trump’s circle, such as former Congressman Matt Gaetz and Vice President J.D. Vance, have long been critics of tech monopolies. Gaetz has focused on perceived censorship of conservative voices, while Vance has called for reforms to rein in monopolistic practices. Pam Bondi, Trump’s new nominee for attorney general, could play a key role in this agenda. Bondi has a notable record of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, having recovered over $1 billion in such matters as Florida’s attorney general. However, her direct involvement with Big Tech enforcement has been limited. Bondi’s public support for former President Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2021 suggests a willingness to challenge Big Tech’s influence but leaves questions about her approach to structural remedies. This momentum aligns with rare bipartisan support, highlighted by the latest action from the DOJ under President Biden. Influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have also advocated breaking up Big Tech, arguing that monopolies stifle innovation and harm small businesses. With mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle, Big Tech now faces an unprecedented challenge. The U.S. is not alone in scrutinizing Big Tech. Across the Atlantic, European regulators, led by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, have ramped up investigations. Proposed remedies, such as forcing Google to divest its ad tech business, reflect a global trend toward stricter oversight. European lawmakers like Andreas Schwab advocate robust measures to ensure fair competition and foster innovation. These efforts could inspire similar actions in other jurisdictions, further pressuring U.S.-based tech giants. A breakup of major tech firms could echo past antitrust actions, such as the breakup of AT&T’s Bell System in the 1980s or the case against Microsoft in the 1990s. Here’s a closer look at the likely targets: A breakup of Big Tech could have profound implications for innovation. Large tech companies have been instrumental in advancing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and sustainable energy solutions. For instance, Microsoft and Amazon have explored nuclear power options to meet the energy demands of AI data centers. Disrupting these corporate giants could slow progress in areas like AI development and power generation, particularly as hyperscalers have the resources to invest in ambitious, long-term projects. However, breaking up Big Tech might also create opportunities for smaller, more agile companies to step up. A less concentrated market could foster competition, enabling a diverse range of businesses to tackle these challenges. This democratization of innovation could lead to creative solutions that were previously overshadowed by Big Tech’s dominance. While the transition could bring short-term disruption, it may ultimately stimulate a more competitive technological landscape. A breakup of Big Tech would create seismic shifts in the industry, presenting both opportunities and challenges: While a breakup is not guaranteed, the bipartisan appetite for antitrust reform and the Trump administration’s rhetoric suggest significant changes are possible. A dismantling of Big Tech could redefine how technology is developed, consumed and regulated in the U.S. and beyond. The stakes are enormous. As the tech industry braces for potential upheaval, businesses, policymakers and consumers must prepare for a future that could look radically different. Whether this transformation fosters a more competitive marketplace—or introduces new challenges—remains to be seen. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/24/2024 3:42:15 AM PST by Libloather The Washington Post used to be one of the best gigs in journalism. No longer. In a business where it generally sucks to be an employee (except for the NY Post, of course), the “WaPo,” as it is known in journalism circles, has really descended into the abyss, On The Money has learned. Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting.Deep Throat (or Mark Felt) eventually had a falling out with Bob Woodward because the Washington Post refused to publish all the information that Felt furnished to Woodward, namely that both Watergate burglaries were a CIA-led operations. The WaPo ignored and refused to publish information that would put Nixon in a favorable light. The Washington Post was fake news before Dan Rather and 60 Minutes invented fake news. 13 posted on 11/24/2024 4:47:12 AM PST by Right_Wing_Madman [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Right_Wing_Madman The Compost has been a water-carrier for the CIA since the 1950s—Operation Mockingbird.

That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper his holding company bought for $250 million in October 2013.

Then, just after the Nats won the WS, he got political, so I canceled my subscription. I read that he has retired, so no more Pravda on the Potomac for me! Print media across the country runs AP news. The rag we subscribe to runs their trash and it’s no different than MSNBC or CNN. Just about any article the AP puts out is editorial grade where facts are seldom and lies are frequent. Over the years the physical size of the paper used as well as the number of pages in a daily print are probably less than a 10th what it used to be in paper weight.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Cars with a manual transmission now make up a tiny share of autos sold in the US. An updated Porsche 911 Carrera is a reminder of how fun they can be, says BI's chief car reviewer. On the agenda today: But first: Look out, government workers. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. For a minute there, working for the government was in vogue. TikTok videos espoused the benefits of #publicsector jobs, and Google searches for "how to get a government job" hit a five-year high. Younger workers, in particular, were drawn to employment considered less vulnerable to layoffs. Then Elon Musk arrived on the scene. The Department for Government Efficiency, co-headed by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has outlined plans to slash federal jobs. DOGE will work with agency appointees to find the minimum number of employees required to perform its functions, per the duo. That has some government workers on edge. (You can see where the most federal staffers work and how much they're paid here.) Several careers consultants told Business Insider they were already experiencing a rush of demand from workers ready to shift to the private sector. Laura Labovich, CEO of The Career Strategy Group, told BI that these workers weren't complaining about their promotion prospects or compensation, as they might have in the past. "They just say, 'I want to leave,'" she said. Comcast, one of the biggest cable TV companies in the US, announced plans to split off almost all of its cable TV networks — CNBC, MSNBC, USA, and a few digital assets — but keep the rest of its media business, including Peacock, NBC, and Bravo. The move further cements the decline of cable, as the number of people paying for and watching these networks is falling every year, BI's Peter Kafka writes. More on the big break up. Also read: By all the standard economic measures, America's labor market looks fine. But ask any white-collar professional, and they'll tell you a horror story that would prove otherwise. Hiring has held up well for low-earning workers, but those making six figures or more are in the midst of a white-collar recession. New data from LinkedIn, which tracked how often its users landed new jobs, shows that tech jobs in particular have been among the hardest hit. More on who's being affected by the hiring slump. Your age probably says a lot about how you remember TGI Fridays. The restaurant chain began as a singles bar in the '60s, and then it evolved into a family-friendly spot in the '80s and '90s. Now, it's a place no one really wants to go. Fridays closed 36 underperforming corporate-owned restaurants at the beginning of the year and recently filed for bankruptcy. Its slow decline and accelerated crash is a familiar story for many restaurant chains. Why casual dining went bust. Amazon's voice assistant became something of a household icon when it launched a decade ago. But maintaining that success has proved difficult.

Title: Commentary: Stealth firing or ethical dismissal? Why employers terminate staff for minor offences

Commentary Enforcing a hard line on employee conduct could prevent bigger lapses but may prompt claims of disguised cost savings, says Anjli Raval for the Financial Times. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. (Photo: iStock) LONDON: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy recently told employees that a new plan requiring them to be in the office five days a week did not amount to a “backdoor layoff”. Yet his reported comments at a company-wide meeting last week did not rebut a previous suggestion from a senior manager that staff who fail to comply could look for work elsewhere. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. Alongside a string of recent publicly announced mass layoffs – by companies including Nissan, Boeing and Citigroup – there have been a series of employers quietly justifying smaller-scale dismissals because of seemingly minor violations of company policy. Here the focus is not on the size and scope of redundancy programmes, how humanely managers handled them or whether support or severance pay was offered to affected staff, but on the specific rationale behind the decisions. Facebook owner Meta, for example, sacked about two dozen staff for abusing meal credit vouchers, while EY terminated the employment of a group of workers for watching multiple training videos at once, the Financial Times has reported. Infractions that workers have probably interpreted as minor misdemeanours in the past can now be sackable offences, and may prompt questions about whether cost savings are being disguised. “As with most stories, there are two sides,” says Leo Martin, managing director of GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy that helps organisations design, build and improve their ethics and compliance programmes. “From the employee perspective they may have been given unrealistic deadlines, excessive work pressures or have received unclear guidance as to what is expected, while the employer will feel that abusing a perk or taking short-cuts undermines their systems, [and that] cheating in an exam or lying about training … is a fundamental breach of trust.” Part of the motivation to take a tough line on employees could be to make an example of anyone deemed to be a rule-breaker. This level of corporate discipline has been more common among heavily regulated industries, such as banking and financial services, that have huge compliance functions and the risk of hefty penalties for any conduct breaches. Amanda Rajkumar, who has held senior human-resources (HR) leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas, says: “Banks and financial services have always come down hard … given the robust regulatory environment and strong requirement to demonstrate exemplary, ethical behaviour related to the fiduciary nature of the industry.” Another incentive for a tough stance is that small infractions, such as taking advantage of company perks or bending minor rules, can foreshadow more serious ethical lapses. This has fuelled a “zero-tolerance” approach to policy enforcement in some sectors, as companies seek to preserve what they see as a culture of integrity. One example from the financial crisis was when Fidelity Investments fired employees for being part of a fantasy football league that went against the company’s gambling rule. Early this year, several employees at US retailer Target were sacked after they used their status as staff to buy highly coveted Stanley cups ahead of customers. “The spotlight should be on the employees’ reason or motivation for breaking the rules,” adds Rajkumar. “A deliberate misuse of company resources usually indicates low engagement or a specific gripe against the firm.” A recent trend of staff turning to online platforms to vent their frustrations about perceived mistreatment by employers or indiscriminate layoffs has also pushed some companies to recalibrate their approach. Websites such as LinkedIn and anonymous review site, Glassdoor, give workers an outlet for grievances about their bosses, which can then spread quickly and damage the reputation of employers. In one example that went viral this year, Brittany Pietsch, an employee at internet company Cloudflare, recorded her nine-minute virtual meeting with HR representatives in which she was fired, and posted it to TikTok, spawning a new “Quit-Tok” trend. In the video, Pietsch confronted her seniors about the reasons for her termination, but they had “no specific” answers or “clarity”. Aware that employee complaints about terminations are no longer confined to private HR files, some companies are aiming to reduce backlash and curb reputational risk by emphasising policy-driven grounds for firing. Recruiters, HR heads and workplace experts say whether an employer has made a clear case for dismissal is becoming as important as the manner in which a termination is conducted. “Companies have had to be more mindful when they are firing staff because people are more vocal. We are in an era where snap decisions can have big blowbacks,” says Habiba Khatoon, a director at headhunter Robert Walters. She adds that in her experience managers are so wary of dismissing workers out of turn that they are delaying action until a record has been built of repeated performance issues or behaviour that violates company policy. Khatoon says more companies are talking about so-called “ethical firing”. This refers to a transparent, rule-based approach to dismissals, where managers can point to concrete breaches in policy rather than subjective issues, such as workers being a “poor fit”. Targeting terminations in this way has some advantages for employers. Basing decisions on documented infractions can help reduce staff numbers – and cut costs – without the optics of a struggling business that come with mass layoffs. And unlike big rounds of job cuts, which often require severance packages, firings for conduct issues are typically exempt from such obligations. Lucas Shaw, an expert in hiring and retention strategies, says he has been part of a conversation in which senior staff at a company – not one of his clients – instructed their IT team to look for misconduct on an individual’s record to avoid paying a costly redundancy settlement. “It’s incredibly underhand.” Employment experts say such practices underscore the need for staff to closely read and understand company policies and codes of conduct, which are at times being followed more rigidly than in the past. The advice for employers is to provide stronger and simpler guidelines about what is acceptable and what is not. Rules and disciplinary processes must be unambiguous and fairly applied no matter how senior an employee is. “Companies need to ensure they carry out fair and thorough investigations regarding any allegation of misconduct,” says GoodCorporation’s Martin. “Not only does this ensure a proper process is followed, it can also protect an organisation from accusations that what they are doing may have an ulterior motive.” In an era when workers prioritise transparency, selective enforcement of codes of conduct can erode trust as employees might see it as an excuse to target some staff. This, in the long run, may “be more damaging to the company than the actual employee misconduct”, warns Martin.
