Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? While you’re busy shopping through all of the Best Cyber Monday deals, here’s a little something that might pique your interest. You’ll be even more excited if you spend a lot of time outdoors or off-grid. You might want to wait on grabbing that Cyber Monday portable power station deal. Allow me to explain. The BLUETTI Handsfree 2 is a backpack, like any other outdoor pack you might encounter, except for one thing. It’s also a power station and solar generator. Believe me when I say this thing is insane and super useful. But for Cyber Monday, there’s a deal that includes the BLUETTI Handsfree 2 and a 100-watt solar panel to charge it on the go. Normally $799, it’s yours for just $599, saving you $200. Wow. You have to read what it can all do, so don’t leave just yet. At first glance, it looks like any regular outdoor or hiking backpack. It has a lot of functions that would serve you well on the trail or while camping, too. For example, there are MOLLE hangable points to hang your sleeping bag, tent, or solar panels. It has a travel essentials zone for stowing shoes, clothing, medicine, and necessities. It has a photography gear zone for lenses, cameras, and even drones. It also has the much-needed, power station zone where the power station tech is stored. Like any other power station, the integrated one can be charged via solar, auto ports, AC outlets, and generators. The solar panel that comes with it can plug right into the station, and then hang from your backpack while you travel. That entire time it powers up the station inside. The entire pack is IPX4 splash-resistant and has load-bearing belts, back panel support, waist pads, waist belts, shoulder straps, and chest straps. So, basically, it’s super comfortable and supportive everywhere it needs to be. It’s also large enough to carry everything you need for the day while you’re out hiking or camping. While all of that is incredible. What’s truly exciting to me is the Cyber Monday price. Maybe I’m alone here but saving $200 on something like this is awesome. Normally $799, it’s yours for $599. I have no idea how long this deal is going to last but I’m going to shop it myself I think. When I get my hands on one I’ll let you know what I think, but if I were you, I wouldn’t wait around for that info. The deal will be long gone by then. If the past two sultry summers taught us one thing, it’s that we never want to be without power -- for air conditioning, other appliances, and devices -- especially when we need it most. That in itself is a great reason to browse these generator deals. And right now at Amazon, you can score $150 off this Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator. It’s down to only $500, and then there’s a coupon to get an extra $50 off its original price of $600. Never be without power again with this amazing deal. We’ve all been there: Suddenly, the lights and Wi-Fi go out, the TV goes off, and you’re powerless to do anything. Blackouts are a fact of life, but you never need to be without power again with the Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator from Jackery. It can not only provide important power during blackouts, but it’s incredibly helpful for camping trips and any outdoor activities far from a power source. This is a household essential that you can’t do without, and at this price, there’s no reason not to grab it. A “20% off sitewide” banner on top of a company’s website should normally be cause for glee among customers. Except if you’re a fan of that company’s products and its executives remain silent amid mounting signs that said company might be on the brink of bankruptcy.That’s what’s happening with Juiced Bikes, the San Diego-based maker of e-bikes.According to numerous customer reports, Juiced Bikes has completely stopped responding to customer inquiries for some time, while its website is out of stock on all products. There are also numerous testimonies of layoffs at the company.Even more worrying signs are also piling up: The company’s assets, including its existing inventory of products, is appearing as listed for sale on an auction website used by companies that go out of business.In addition, a court case has been filed in New York against parent company Juiced Inc. and Juiced Bike founder Tora Harris, according to Trellis, a state trial court legal research platform.Founded in 2009 by Harris, a U.S. high-jump Olympian, Juiced Bikes was one of the early pioneers of the direct-to-consumer e-bike brands in the U.S. market.The company’s e-bikes developed a loyal fandom through the years. Last year, Digital Trends named the Juiced Bikes Scorpion X2 as the best moped-style e-bike for 2023, citing its versatility, rich feature set, and performance.The company has so far stayed silent amid all the reports. But should its bankruptcy be confirmed, it could legitimately be attributed to the post-pandemic whiplash experienced by the e-bike industry over the past few years. The Covid-19 pandemic had led to a huge spike in demand for e-bikes just as supply chains became heavily constrained. This led to a ramp-up of e-bike production to match the high demand. But when consumer demand dropped after the pandemic, e-bike makers were left with large stock surpluses.The good news is that the downturn phase might soon be over just as the industry is experiencing a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to a report by Houlihan Lokey.This may mean that even if Juiced Bikes is indeed going under, the brand and its products might find a buyer and show up again on streets and trails. If you've been on the internet and seen a bunch of pressure washer clips and are now considering grabbing one yourself, you'll be happy to know that there is a huge range of them to pick from. That includes some great budget-oriented versions to dip your toe in and are still good for cleaning stains and cleaning up stuff. That's why we've gone out and collected some of our favorite washer deals for you below, including some of the best pressure washers for cars, which you do have to be a bit careful with not to strip the paint or clearcoat. Greenworks Pressure Washer Combo Kit -- $110 $220 50% off While this Greenworks power washer doesn't have as high a PSI, around 1,900 PSI, it is a lot more portable and a great option if you want something that's smaller and easier to take around with you. It comes with a 35-foot power chord and a 20-foot hose, so you get quite a bit of distance. If you are somewhere rural and need to clean stuff that doesn't have a power cable nearby, this is perfect.

Title: Amazon employees are ‘rage-applying’ as its return-to-office mandate looms—experts say that’s exactly what CEO Andy Jassy wants

Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced in September, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them: that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on October 2, 2024. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How will the return-to-office push play out in Boston?

By Jon Chesto, The Boston Globe It was the memo heard around the working world: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy informed tens of thousands of workers that they should head to the office five days a week come January. The new policy announced in September sparked intense conversations about returning to the office, and not just at Amazon. The move was seen as a harbinger, an important milestone in the ever-shifting approach to in-person work since the COVID-19 pandemic rewrote the rules nearly five years ago. As Amazon workers digested Jassy’s directive, Sal Lupoli was huddling with his own management team in Lawrence, trying to figure out the best way to improve collaboration among his 200 or so employees at his real estate firm, Lupoli Cos. In the end, the restaurateur-turned-developer came to a similar decision last month as Jassy: It’s time, finally, to return to prepandemic practices and bring people back all week long. “There’s a level of camaraderie, there’s a level of interaction, there’s a level of ‘me reading your body language’ that you can’t do over Zoom,” said Lupoli, whose office employees now come in five days a week. “We’ve lost so much of this interaction. We’ve just got to get it back.” From giant companies like Amazon to local businesses like Lupoli’s, many executives have been rethinking their return-to-office requirements after a year of relative stability. And while many major office employers show no signs of budging, evidence of a changing mood is starting to pile up. A recent survey by consultancy firm KPMG shows 79 percent of US chief executives expect to resume largely in-office work within the next three years, up from 62 percent a year ago. Along with Amazon, other tech employers with a major presence in Massachusetts are well on the way, such as Salesforce — now at three days a week or more, depending on the job, as of Oct. 1 — and Dell, every day for sales teams as of Sept. 30. CarGurus will require workers to be in the office 60 percent of the time starting in January — essentially three days a week, up from two currently — and environmental services firm Veolia North America is adopting a similar requirement. Chief executive Micah Remley, whose Boston firm Robin makes workplace management software for employers, said the balance of power has shifted to employers in the current labor market, compared with two years ago. In some places, attendance requirements focused on building an in-office culture are factored into performance reviews or are used to subtly trim payrolls as people voluntarily leave and are not replaced. “The vise is starting to tighten,” Remley said. “You can just see this tide turning. … The data doesn’t show it yet, but we are seeing it. Companies are newly emboldened.” Once a laggard in the share of the workforce returning to the office, Boston now appears to be around the national average, if not above it. Mayor Michelle Wu recently bragged to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce that occupancy at office buildings owned by BXP now exceeds 90 percent of prepandemic levels — on Tuesdays through Thursdays. Financial services, law, and real estate workers are more likely to be in the office. Tech startups and government agencies, less so. Return-to-office trends could have huge consequences for the battered commercial real estate industry, which is suffering from some of the worst vacancy rates in memory. Roughly one out of every four offices in downtown Boston are empty. While there are some signs the situation could be stabilizing, the return-to-office requirements haven’t been pervasive enough to start turning things around yet, because most companies are holding onto their hybrid or remote schedules, said Ashley Lane, senior vice president at brokerage Perry CRE. Then there’s the broader impact on Boston’s struggling downtown. Michael Nichols, president of the Downtown Boston Business Improvement District, says foot traffic is on track to rise 4 percent from last year, with a pickup seen in the second half of 2024 as more return-to-office requirements kick in after a slow start. But traffic is still considerably short of prepandemic levels, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. He pointed to numbers from data analytics firm Placer.ai that show weekday commuting traffic in Boston at 58 percent of prepandemic levels, close to the average of the top 25 cities in the country. Nichols has been positioning the downtown to be less reliant on office commuters, but they are still critical to the district’s health. “The core concern I heard two years ago was that companies didn’t want to be isolated in their return-to-office [approach] and that they could lose talent to someone who is allowing more days at home,” Nichols said. “Now I think that fear is eroding.” However, for every office employer that increases its requirement, there are others keeping the status quo, based on the Globe’s inquiries to local companies in recent weeks. Liberty Mutual remains at two days a week, while MassMutual and John Hancock are at three. Attendance is sparser at health insurers Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Point32Health. On the other end of the spectrum, Wayfair started requiring corporate employees to return four days a week (tech workers could opt for three) last year, as did State Street, though neither seems poised to go further. The bottom line for Boston: The city now has the widest spectrum of return-to-office requirements since the term first started being used, early in the pandemic. That said, few companies are expected to match Amazon’s extreme position, at least for now. “I appreciate their boldness [but] I think four days a week is going to be the high and three days a week will be the low,” said John Dolan, managing director for New England at brokerage Avison Young. “It all depends on the type of industry, but three to four seems like the sweet spot.” Veolia is among the local employers entering that sweet spot. Starting in January, Veolia office employees will be expected to show up three days a week, up from two currently. (Most field workers already work in person all five days by necessity.) In Boston, the change coincides with a move of the headquarters to a smaller office in the Financial District. Veolia North America chief executive Fred Van Heems said he unveiled this new plan in part to address employees who felt disengaged during the pandemic. Also, onboarding newcomers, particularly younger workers, is easier when they have more time in person with their more experienced peers. “It’s a lot easier to convey joy when you have people around you, than through screens,” Van Heems said. “It’s good for us as a company and for the people individually, and important for the collective mental health that we have more human interactions.” At Akamai Technologies in Cambridge, though, executives are taking a different approach. In mid-2022, Akamai allowed nearly all employees the option to work in person, at home, or a hybrid of the two. They get to decide based on where they feel they’re most productive. Akamai chief human resources officer Anthony Williams said the company has seen an average 25 percent increase in the number of applicants per open job since adopting the policy and a 40-plus percent drop in attrition (although it has also announced three rounds of layoffs since the pandemic began). “We believe this is a differentiator for us as a company,” Williams said of Akamai’s policy. “We’re a company that operates on the internet. What greater way to show the power of the internet than showing we can be successful in operating in a virtual environment.” Meanwhile, entrepreneur Gogi Gupta is taking an “office first” approach that essentially requires people to come into the office four days a week, or five if they just joined and are learning the ropes, to enhance employee retention and culture. Gupta, who employs about 80 people in Boston at his marketing firm Gupta Media, enacted a policy called “Flex 48″ at the start of the year, a reference to the number of days in the year they can work from home. “There’s a number of people who don’t apply to work here, and that’s all right,” Gupta said. “The extroverts and the people who believe in collaborative work and enjoy an office environment, they’re very excited.” ©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC Stay up to date with everything Boston.

Title: The new ‘land grab’ for AI companies, from Meta to OpenAI, is military contracts
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/27/ai-companies-meta-llama-openai-google-us-defense-military-contracts/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T11:05:00Z

Silicon Valley AI companies have a new BFF: the U.S. Department of Defense. The leading companies developing generative AI technology have spun up, deepened, or started to pursue relationships with the military in recent months in some cases even revising or making exceptions to internal policies to remove roadblocks and restrictions on defense work. Several agencies within the DoD, from The Air Force to various Intelligence groups, are actively testing out use cases for AI models and tools from Meta, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, along with tech from startups like Gladstone AI and ScaleAI, several people with knowledge of the testing told Fortune. It’s a remarkable turn of events for the internet companies, who until very recently treated defense work as if it were taboo, if not outright verboten. But with the cost to develop and run generative AI services already totaling hundreds of billions of dollars, and showing no signs of slowing, AI companies are feeling the pressure to show some returns on the massive investments. The DoD, with its essentially unlimited budget and long standing interest in cutting-edge technology, suddenly doesn’t look so bad. Although landing a contract with Defense can be tricky, with layers of certifications to receive and strict compliance standards to follow, “the rewards are significant” and the money can come in for years, Erica Brescia, a managing partner at Redpoint Ventures who focuses on AI investing, said. “DoD contracts provide substantial annual contract values, or ACVs, and create long-term opportunities for growth and market defensibility,” Brescia said. Brescia added that going after Defense work has recently become more socially acceptable in tech circles. Not only are company leaders looking at the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts that defense-focused startups like Palantir and Anduril are raking in, but the “changing political landscape” has made “pursuing defense as a primary market segment an increasingly attractive option for companies prepared to navigate longer sales cycles and handle complex deployments.” An embrace of military work may indeed suit the political moment well, with a business-friendly Trump administration set to take office in January, and a cohort of hawkish Silicon Valley insiders, led by “First Buddy” Elon Musk, in the president elect’s inner circle. Musk’s mandate in his official role as co-head of the new Department of Government Efficiency is to sharply curtail spending. But few expect the Pentagon’s budget to see serious cutbacks, particularly when it comes to AI at a time when the U.S. and China are locked in battle for AI supremacy. For now, much of the military’s work with generative AI appears to be small-scale projects and tests, but the potential for generative AI tech to become a fundamental aspect of computing in the future means the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon could be huge. Defense uses of AI do not necessarily entail drone warfare or blowing things up. A lot of AI-specific work within the DoD is the more mundane activity that any office would gladly hand off to a capable technology. Data labeling, collection and sorting are common uses of AI within the department, as is the use of ChatGPT and Claude chatbots that most people can access online, but which require extra security when used by the DoD. Large language models could also prove handy for analyzing and searching classified information, aiding in government cybersecurity work, and providing better computer vision and autonomy for things like robotic tools, drones and tanks. Some tech companies do attempt to specifically avoid being involved in DoD projects that could be utilized in “the kill chain,” a military term referring to the structure of an attack on an enemy, a former official within the DoD told Fortune regarding companies that win procurement contracts. Such concerns sometimes dissipate however, as millions, or billions, of dollars become available. “Once you get in, you want to expand,” the person added. Some tech companies, like Palantir and Anduril, have for years made Defense uses and contracts the backbone of their entire business. Within Silicon Valley’s established internet companies and some of its younger AI startups, however, military work was eschewed as the firms sought to recruit and retain left-leaning engineering talent. When Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, it reportedly committed never to use the startup’s technology for military purposes. And in 2018 Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai faced an internal backlash over Google’s participation in Project Maven, a Pentagon drone warfare effort. While Google insisted its technology was used for only “non offensive purposes” such as analyzing drone video footage, the employee outcry was loud enough that Pichai cancelled a vacation to reassure staff and eventually promised Google would not develop its AI for weapons. Google’s “AI principles” now stipulate that it will “not pursue… weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people,” nor for “surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.” But the policy leaves plenty of wiggle room and the company has explicitly said it will not swear off working with the military entirely. The story is similar at other big AI players. Meta initially prohibited its Llama model from being used in military work, as did OpenAI, while Anthropic initially built its Claude model to be “harmless.” Now, all three have announced that such work with their models is fine, and they’re actively pursuing such uses. Sam Altman, who co-founded OpenAI on the principle of developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole,” and who once said there were things he would “never do with the Department of Defense,” has since removed any commitment to such restrictions from its usage policy. One venture capitalist focused on investing in AI companies pointed to VC firm Andreessen Horowitz’s “American Dynamism” essay two years ago as a moment when avoidance of defense contracting started to shift. The essay explicitly said tech companies working on defense were working in support of America’s national interest. “Executives started to think, ‘Oh, ok, defending America, working with the military, is good actually,” the VC said. The widespread post-pandemic layoffs at tech companies has also had a chilling effect on employee protests, giving tech employers more freedom to pursue military business. The DoD has already paid out close to $1 billion in official contracts to AI companies in the last two years, according to a Fortune analysis. While details of such contracts are vague, they have been awarded to companies like Morsecorp, which is focused on autonomous vehicle technology, and a subsidiary of ASGN, a management and consulting company, to develop new AI prototypes. Not all such contracts are made public. But any government procurement contract awarded to a major AI company would likely be worth tens of millions to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in revenue for those companies — and for their largest backers. OpenAI’s largest investor is Microsoft, which recently said its Azure cloud service had been approved for DoD agencies to use OpenAI’s AI models for information at lower levels of security clearance – something that took years of investment in specialized infrastructure to achieve. Similarly, Anthropic’s largest backer is Amazon. Amazon Web Services is perhaps the single largest cloud provider to the DoD and has tens of billions of dollars worth of government contracts. For both companies, being able to add new AI services and tools to DoD offerings could prove valuable. Same goes for a company like Google, which also has secured valuable government contracts, and its Gemini AI model. “They’re basically building the airplane while they’re flying it, so it’s a massive land grab,” one AI executive told Fortune, referring to more tech companies suddenly eager to have their AI tools and models in the hands of the DoD. The DoD defines AI among its 14 “critical technology areas,” as it holds “tremendous promise” and is “imperative to dominate future conflicts.” About a year ago, the DoD officially created the Office of Strategic Capital, a new federal credit program in partnership with the Small Business Administration, in order to ensure that critical technologies like AI receive funding through direct loans. For fiscal 2024, OSC made $984 million available that it intended to hand out to 10 companies focused on things like autonomous robotics and microelectronics fabrication, which typically includes AI chip fabrication. The DoD is investing another roughly $700 million in chip fabrication and the build out of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, which is critical to the creation of AI chips. Despite billions in investment and no signs of that slowing down within Defense, the AI executive admitted that most AI products today are simply “not that useful yet,” either for Defense or the public at large. But having them applied at scale in a government or defense environment could make them more useful, more quickly. “The military effectively created the Internet, too.” ARPANET, a key technological foundation of the modern Internet, was built within the DoD, as were now common technologies like radar and GPS systems. Although a department like Defense wants useful products, it also famously sees its budget increase year after year, hitting just below $1 trillion in 2024. About half of that budget is awarded to companies that contract with the department. “Honestly, yeah, they really love to blow money,” the executive said.

Title: As Patagonia tightens operations, workers say the company has lost its soul

The sustainable brand is cutting jobs and expediting service to survive. Employees say the company has lost its soul. When new employees join Patagonia, they're handed a copy of "Let My People Go Surfing." The company's founder, Yvon Chouinard, who wrote the book in 2005, said it was intended as a "philosophical manual for the employees of Patagonia." In the book, Chouinard declares that treating employees well is a key corporate responsibility. "One thing I never wanted to change, even if we got serious: Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis," Chouinard wrote. "We needed to blur that distinction between work and play and family." Since its founding in 1973, Patagonia has positioned itself as a workplace nirvana — a community more so than a company, one that prioritizes the well-being of the Earth and of its employees above all else. But in the past few years, as sales have slowed, the outdoor-apparel brand has buckled down, cutting redundant jobs, tracking performance metrics, and banning long-standing practices such as letting sales representatives sell Patagonia samples to friends and family on the side. It has also started to respond to customers' demand for delivery at Amazon speed. The rejiggering is a means of survival, a necessity, Patagonia says, to provide for its 3,000-plus employees. But the retailer is now dealing with the fallout from disappointed staffers who say the new rigidity feels antithetical to the company's ethos. "It's always been a self-critical culture," Vincent Stanley, Patagonia's director of philosophy, told Business Insider. "Whenever the company does something that's not well understood to be part of the values, you get a lot of internal reaction to it." Patagonia is a billion-dollar company with more than 70 stores worldwide. The brand's $130 vests and $280 jackets are just as likely to be sported on Wall Street as in the great outdoors — earning it the nickname "Patagucci." Patagonia's commitment to do good is integral to the brand. In 1985 it created an "Earth tax," pledging 1% of sales to preserve and restore the natural environment. Over the years it has donated the equivalent of $226 million to environmental causes. Patagonia's sales soared during the pandemic. From summer 2020 to summer 2022, sales grew at a rate of about 20% to 25% companywide, Alan Adams, a former US regional sales rep for Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska, told BI. Adams, who left Patagonia in 2023, said COVID-19 restrictions led to an "unsustainable" boom, adding that the renewed interest in outdoor activities had people stocking up on all-weather gear and apparel. For a period, as California ports faced major backlogs, Patagonia relied on planes to transport about a third of its goods. (Before the pandemic, about 80% of Patagonia stock was shipped by barge, a decidedly more environmentally friendly option.) A Patagonia spokesperson told BI that it uses less air freight now than it did before the pandemic. Patagonia started to attract a new customer base less attached to its green credentials and more demanding of superspeed delivery. "What we do to make the customer happy and to save ourselves from backlash is not environmentally sustainable," said a current customer-service, or CX, manager who has been at the company for multiple years. "If someone doesn't like their repair, it doesn't match perfectly, then we ship them a new item overnight." The Patagonia spokesperson said it had been tricky to navigate the demand for instant gratification. "What I don't know is how do we support our customer-service team when customers are like, 'Well, Amazon sends it to me overnight. Why can't Patagonia?'" the spokesperson said. She added that Patagonia has an "ironclad guarantee" to give customers a new item if they don't like a repair. While overnight shipping is an option, Patagonia tries to direct customers away from that choice with pricing and messaging, she said. Workers said Chouinard, now 86, was typically one to challenge decisions that prioritized profit over sustainability. Adams said that at an event in Idaho around 2013, Chouinard seemed shocked at how large Patagonia's sales representatives' trucks were. He kicked a tire and asked one rep: "Why do you have this huge truck? That's not what we're about." In September 2022, Chouinard, who sits on Patagonia's board, announced that he was giving away his shares of the company to a newly formed trust to fight the climate crisis. At about this time, Patagonia began reassessing its operations. For the better part of the year, the spokesperson said, the senior leadership team was "locked in a room" figuring out which priorities they weren't achieving and how decision-making could be improved. They also hired consultants to help restructure the company, the spokesperson added. Many employees felt as though Patagonia's new direction directly threatened the utopia they — and customers — had been sold. A worker from the digital team expressed concern about Patagonia's buy-now, pay-later feature that launched this past June. "It feels like it's encouraging people to spend more money than they can currently afford, and buy more things that they don't need, which goes directly against Patagonia's mission and anti-consumption message," the employee said. Stanley, the company's director of philosophy, told BI that growth had brought about "complicated decisions" like how to balance the long-term business health against the company's core values while providing a consistent level of benefits to all employees. Financial stability, he said, was crucial for Patagonia to honor its commitments. Like many companies in the wake of the pandemic, Patagonia was left with a surplus of staff and inventory, Adams said. In the past few years, it has tried to rein in costs and streamline business operations. In the fall of 2022, Patagonia said it would stop allowing sales reps to sell extra clothing samples to their friends and family. Adams, who made about $350,000 in 2022, according to tax documents seen by BI, said this was a significant change. He said that even with a promised increase to his base salary and bonus, he would have expected to bring in just under $200,000 in 2023 with the new rules. (The spokesperson said the salary increases and bonuses were meant to fully make up any differences in sales reps' total pay.) The following year, Patagonia adjusted a three-year-old policy of closing for the last week of December. The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that the new policy asked CX and warehouse employees to volunteer for holiday shifts at higher pay in order to ensure customers received service during the busy season. In July 2023, Patagonia introduced a career-leveling plan for all US employees to more clearly define roles and match pay grades to the market standard. The company also became more focused on tracking metrics across teams. "It used to be that we would be able to stay on the phone with a customer for an hour and a half and just connect with them and talk to them," the CX employee who has been at Patagonia for multiple years told BI. "And now we get dinged for having long phone calls." The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that, "We look at time on calls because it is a metric to make sure everyone is trained appropriately, but no one is dinged for this." Eventually, though, the company began cutting jobs. In June, Patagonia gave 90 employees on the CX team 72 hours to decide whether they wanted to relocate to one of seven US hubs or leave their jobs. Only four chose to relocate, according to an internal memo seen by BI. The Patagonia spokesperson told BI that the changes were "crucial for us to build a vibrant team culture" and that the CX team had been overstaffed by 200% to 300%. Three months later, Patagonia announced that 41 corporate staffers had been let go. In an internal memo sent the day the layoffs were announced, Stanley wrote that the company was experiencing the first sales decline in its history. In a follow-up FAQ about the layoffs, Stanley added that because of the financial strains, travel would be limited, bonuses would be lowered, and hiring would be paused across the company. After being told for years how important employees' happiness was and even being handed a book expounding these merits, workers were shaken. In "Let My People Go Surfing," Chouinard called layoffs "almost unthinkable" for Patagonia and described a round of job cuts in 1991 as "the single darkest day in the company's history." Several people said the 72-hour deadline for CX employees was insufficient to make such a major life decision. Another CX worker still at the company said the ultimatum was presented without "dignity or care or anything that Patagonia stands for." During a time when workers more generally were growing distrustful of their workplaces, many felt Patagonia was trying to "quiet fire" staffers, with one employee calling it "an easy way for them to reduce their head count rather than waiting for attrition." Nick Helmreich, a team lead at Patagonia's outlet store in Reno, Nevada, since 2022, recalled one colleague telling him, "Camelot is truly dead." Many employees BI talked to said that, despite the recent upheavals, the company still treated its employees better than most corporations. But they said the brand was not living up to the standards with which it markets itself. In March, nine of the 15 eligible employees working at Patagonia's Reno store voted to form the company's first union. "Pay is really only one of the reasons for organizing," Helmreich said. "Employees aren't going to be excited about protecting the planet if you cannot protect the people doing that work." The CX worker who's been at the company for years told BI that "the focus appears to be shifting away from the principles of mutual respect and community that Patagonia has long championed." Patagonia said it takes employees' concerns seriously. But as Stanley wrote in his internal note in September, the workforce may not always agree with leadership's decisions: "The balancing act is delicate but is not essentially one of compromising between opposing interests (though some horse trading is involved). We are at our best when we can take a single action that benefits each of our stakeholders, or as many as possible." Corrections: November 28, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated when Patagonia created the "Earth tax." It was 1985, not 2001. An earlier version also wasn't clear about the number of employees who voted for the company's first union at the Reno, Nevada, store. It was nine of 15 able to vote; the store has had about 25 workers. Additionally, we have clarified the company's policy surrounding time off during the last week of December and have added a statement from Patagonia regarding performance metrics. Jump to
