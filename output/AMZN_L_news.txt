HP will cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by 2028 as the company leans into AI adoption, CEO Enrique Lores said during a Q4 earnings call. This "company-wide initiative [aims to] drive customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement," HP says. The layoffs will primarily affect those in product development, internal operations, and customer support roles, and are expected to be implemented by the end of fiscal year 2028. HP expects the job cuts to save nearly $1 billion by the end of 2028. "Structural cost savings represent gross reductions in costs driven by operational efficiency, digital transformation, and portfolio optimization," HP says. "These initiatives include but are not limited to workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation and productivity measures undertaken by HP, which HP expects to be sustainable in the longer-term." Lores promised to provide "the full plan on how AI is transforming HP" at the company's Investor Day on April 23. HP cut a similar number of jobs in 2022; it also laid off 9,000 people in 2019. As of October 2024, HP's headcount reportedly stood at 58,000, meaning the recently announced layoffs could reduce the workforce by about 7-10%. Notably, the company's PC business closed the fiscal year with a net revenue of $10.4 billion, an 8% year-over-year growth, while its printer business brought in $4.3 billion, down 4% year over year. HP now joins a long list of tech giants announcing layoffs due to AI-driven restructuring or cost cuts. Intel said it would reduce 15% of its workforce in June; Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs in July; Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October; and Verizon just cut 13,000 jobs last month.

Title: FedEx to close Texas logistics hub, cutting 856 jobs as âforever layoffâ trend grows

FedEx is closing a Coppell, Texas facility and permanently laying off 856 employees. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider. This follows other recent FedEx job cuts across North Texas facilities. The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider.

The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The American worker is under siege again, this time in the heart of Texas. In a move that exposes the fragile state of our economy and the disposable view corporations often hold of their workforce, FedEx is shuttering a Coppell logistics facility and laying off 856 employees. The cuts, set to begin in January with the facility closing by April 2026, follow the loss of a major customer to a competitor. This isn't an isolated incident but part of an unsettling pattern of endless job cuts eroding the foundation of the American middle class. FedEx, in its filing with the Texas Workforce Commission, coldly stated the reason: âThis action is necessitated solely by our customerâs decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider.â With that bureaucratic language, nearly 900 livelihoods are deemed expendable. The company noted the closure is âexpected to be permanent.â A pattern of cuts across North Texas The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers. Job review service Glassdoor notes this trend is expected to âstoke worker anxiety as it continues in 2026.â The data is alarming. Layoffs of fewer than 50 people, which made up just 38% of cuts in 2015, now account for 51%. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas observed, âOver the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so itâs surprising to see so many in October.â The brutal timing of these announcements, often just before the holidays, shows an erosion of corporate conscience. The broader landscape is bleak. Major pillars of employment like Amazon, UPS, and Target have announced tens of thousands of job cuts recently. UPS alone has cut about 48,000 jobs this year. Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Why Cyber Monday could break spending records despite economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Deals promoted as some of the best of the holiday season are expected to keep people across the United States glued to their computers and smartphones on Cyber Monday. It’s no secret that buying things online is a staple of many people’s everyday routines. And year after year, those purchases mount during the gift-giving holiday rush. Experts expect consumers to drive record Cyber Monday spending this year, even amid wider economic uncertainty. The firm predicts that buy now, pay later loans will reach a new $1 billion milestone, the vast majority involving purchases made on mobile devices AI-assisted shopping is the talk of the holiday shopping season NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season. They hope to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases still are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Shoppers spend billions on Black Friday to snag holiday deals, despite wider economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year’s holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday — spending billions of dollars both in stores and online. Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. In-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that in-store Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024 — but that's notably better than a decline of 6.2% seen in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Consumers should do their research before giving in to Travel Tuesday temptation NEW YORK (AP) — Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it’s Small Business Saturday. In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday. On the same day as the nonprofit world’s Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency. Trump commutes prison sentence for former private equity executive David Gentile HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of a former investment manager convicted of defrauding investors. It's the latest in a series of clemency actions Trump has taken in white-collar criminal cases. David Gentile had been convicted for his role in what the Justice Department at the time described as a scheme to defraud investors. His firm had raised $1.6 billion to acquire companies. The White House said the firm had disclosed to investors that their capital might go to pay dividends to other investors — undercutting claims that it had engaged in a “Ponzi” scheme in which new investments are used to reimburse previous investors. A lost generation of news consumers? Survey shows how teenagers dislike the news media NEW YORK (AP) — You don't have to tell Cat Murphy or Lily Ogburn about the attitudes of young people toward journalists. The profession hasn't been popular among adults for many years, but a new survey shows the extent to which teens aged 13 to 18 feel the same way; Murphy and Ogburn have seen it for years among their friends who wonder why they want to go into the field. Experts say it's a combination of their surroundings, including the most prominent politician they have known — Donald Trump — who frequently denounces “fake news” — and a lack of understanding of journalism's role in society. Trump says Venezuelan airspace should be viewed as closed. Maduro government slams 'colonial threat' WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The Venezuelan government is accusing President Donald Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty. That charge comes after Trump's social media post Saturday that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety.” His assertion raises more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The White House isn't responding to questions about what Trump meant by his post. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry says “such declarations constitute a hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act.” The Federal Aviation Administration's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. Vote count under way in Honduras to elect new president in a close race after Trump’s intervention TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Poll workers have begun tallying Hondurans’ votes as the country moves to elect a new president only days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced he would pardon a former president. Voting was extended an hour beyond the original closing time in many locations to accommodate remaining voters. No major voting problems were initially reported by electoral authorities. Voters will also elect a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions. Shoppers hit Black Friday sales with celebratory mood despite economic strain NEW YORK (AP) — The economic picture hasn’t looked very rosy. Hiring has been sluggish. Consumers have been hit with soaring meat prices. Layoffs are rippling through companies. But despite those concerns, shoppers were hitting the stores in full strength on Black Friday. They were sipping champagne as they searched for discounts on the day that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more selective with their purchases while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the winter holidays. Venezuelan leader Maduro may seem desperate. But his loyalty vs punishment strategy is hard to crack CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was once critical of English. But he now sings John Lennon’s "Imagine" and promotes peace with his newest catchphrase “No War, Yes Peace.” Venezuela’s opposition says this is a display of desperation. Opposition leaders hoped military threats would weaken Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party's leadership continues to hold despite the U.S. military buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast. The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Title: Threat To Jobs, Democracy: Why Over 1,000 Amazon Employees Are Pushing Back Against Its AI Policy

In what is being seen as one of the largest internal protest at a tech firm, more than 1,000 employees have signed an open letter warning against the impact of the company's strong AI push. The letter, reviewed by The Guardian, points out AI's triple threat to employment, democracy and climate. Staff from across tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft have backed the letter and engineers, product managers and warehouse workers from Amazon are among the signatories. The letter comes in the backdrop of layoffs made by Amazon as part of its AI expansion plan through scaling up the use of artificial intelligence tools across operations; in turn, prompting questions around crucial topics like job security, workplace surveillance and environmental impact. The layoff announcements in recent period have been seen through the prism of multibillion-dollar commitments for new AI-linked data centres in the US along with rapid AI automations. This is something which has compounded fears of further job cuts, on top of an already mounting pressures related to higher productivity quotas. A senior software engineer was quoted by The Guardian as saying that employees are feeling the pressure to use AI tools for coding and writing, and underscored that management now expects "twice as much work because of AI tools". Another worker highlighted that the use of AI tools is being used as a justification for random productivity quotas despite the tools not bridging the gap. The worker-led initiative also calls upon Amazon to ensure that its data centres run on clean energy so as not to deteriorate the climate situation further. Moreover, it also demands restricting AI products that could encourage and enable "violence, surveillance and mass deportation", and creation of worker-led bodies to oversee how AI is deployed internally. The protest at one of the world’s largest technology companies has become a symbol of growing internal distress among workers along with their resistance to generative AI is reshaping workflows and power dynamics.

Title: If you were laid off, you could 'boomerang' back to your old company. Here's who's more likely to be asked back.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sometimes a layoff isn't a farewell forever. Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle "AI-induced pressures" and economic uncertainty. "In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent," Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. "In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know," Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. "Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees," she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. "Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job — nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore," Derler said. "Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know." Derler said all parties need to have good "layoff hygiene," where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your résumé or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin — not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. "When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call," she said. "Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them." Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

Title: Want to work from home? Here's how 7 people got their managers on board — or secured flexibility themselves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of battling LA traffic, Leslie Snipes decided it was time to talk to her manager. For the first few months of her job as a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency, she drove 60 to 90 minutes to the office a few days a week — but the commute eventually began to take a toll. "I was wasting hours just sitting in traffic," said the 34-year-old. In April of last year, Snipes decided to ask her manager whether she could work remotely almost exclusively. She explained that she'd be more productive working from home and that her team's strongest bonding often happened during business trips and off-site projects. Snipes said she received verbal approval in less than a day — and that she now typically works from the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," she said. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." While some workers are more than happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, Business Insider spoke to seven people who have found ways to secure flexible work arrangements — whether or not they're officially sanctioned. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work, said work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years, despite companies' implementing stricter return-to-office mandates. He believes that's offset by other employers — many of them smaller companies and startups — offering more flexibility. He also hypothesizes that employees are securing exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. Bloom pointed out a possible motivating factor for allowing these exceptions: Managers are generally judged on how their teams perform, and they don't want to risk their best talent quitting or becoming less productive if they're forced back to the office. For this reason, some managers may choose not to enforce office attendance policies too strictly. "Managers ultimately care about their team performance," he said. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers about how they've responded to corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and return-to-office mandates.

Read more on the topic: Childcare responsibilities are a common factor pushing workers to secure work-from-home flexibility. In November 2024, Georg Loewen began working as a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency with a three-day-a-week in-office policy, which required him to make a roughly one-hour commute from New Jersey to Manhattan. But that commute proved challenging. Loewen was responsible for dropping off his one-year-old daughter at day care most mornings, and the 8 a.m. drop-off often made it difficult to catch the ideal 8:20 train that would get him to the office just before 9 — the next one wouldn't get him in until after 10. Even when he was on time, finding a parking spot at the station wasn't guaranteed. Early this year, Loewen's manager initiated a conversation about his challenges getting into the office. Eventually, they came to an agreement. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said the 34-year-old. Loewen said he typically works from the office once or twice a week. His current routine involves dropping off his daughter, heading home to park his car, and then riding a foldable bike 1.5 miles to the station, which allows him to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot. He said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but added that he's consistently felt supported. He may need to work from the office more frequently as his team grows, he said, but for now, he's grateful for the leeway he's been given. A Wisconsin-based mother of three is similarly thankful for the flexible understanding she came to with her manager. In 2023, she'd considered leaving her corporate manufacturing role after the company announced a five-day-a-week office policy. She worried she couldn't meet her childcare responsibilities with a two-hour round-trip commute. Instead, she had an "off the record" conversation with her manager about how much remote work she could get away with. She said they told her to "be here as much as you can." As long as she was in the office a few days a week — especially on days with key in-person meetings — they wouldn't stand in her way. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Some workers have found creative ways to spend less time at the office. When Elysa Ellis began looking for a new role last year, she was hesitant to give up the remote work flexibility she'd grown used to. After landing an interview with a local nonprofit that required employees to work from the office five days a week, she came with a prepared request: a 9-to-3 schedule, instead of the typical 9-to-5. Ellis said it was important for her to be able to pick up her two children from school around 3 p.m. and spend time with them until her husband finished work. "My children are young, so I knew that stepping into an in-office role would impact them a lot," she said, adding, "I felt like I had nothing to lose." By the time Ellis was offered the job, her request had been granted. She would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — and still receive her full salary. In 2022, when a millennial IT professional heard rumors that his employer might implement a stricter return-to-office policy, he began searching for a new role. Shortly after, he landed an offer for a remote position similar to his current role. However, he was hesitant to resign while his company's official policy still allowed remote work, so he decided to secretly juggle both roles — earning $250,000 annually, roughly double his previous income. And if his initial employer ever adopted a stricter in-office policy, he figured he had a backup plan. "I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much," he said. For a millennial finance manager at Amazon, maximizing his work-from-home time meant doing the bare minimum at the office. When Amazon announced in 2023 that it would require corporate employees to work from the office three days a week, he began going in the required number of days — but only worked between nine and 12 hours total across all three days. He said it was feasible because he was the only member of his team based at that office. "I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement," he said. For some, the simplest way to secure work-from-home flexibility is to find a job that offers it from day one. After being laid off from a remote job, a New Jersey-based e-commerce professional landed an offer last year for a role at JPMorgan — one that would require him to commute to a Manhattan office three days a week. As he considered the offer, he estimated that commuting would take nine hours a week and cost him more than $7,000 a year. Around the same time, he received another offer — this one for a remote role with a salary about $5,000 lower than the JPMorgan position. When he compared the two jobs in terms of what he'd earn for every hour he'd have to "invest" in them — factoring in both commuting time and related costs — he said the decision was easy. "JPMorgan just could not compete," he said, adding: "A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering." Jump to

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang allegedly asks managers discouraging AI use: ‘Are you insane?’ — assures employees their jobs aren’t at risk because of AI

The Nvidia chief reportedly made the statement during an all-hands meeting after its record quarterly earnings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang was allegedly recorded telling his people to use more AI while assuring them that they won’t get replaced by the tool. The head of the AI chip giant is reported to have said this during an all-hands meeting after its record-breaking quarter, which was leaked to Business Insider. The statements were reportedly made during the same meeting where he complained about the drop in Nvidia’s stock price despite performing absolutely well, with Huang saying that the market did not appreciate the company’s ‘incredible’ quarter. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI. Are you insane?” Huang reportedly said in the recording. “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence. I promise you; you will have work to do.” This push to use more AI tools has been happening across the industry, especially among massive tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. These two giants have been mandating their employees to use AI, with the use of such tools becoming a part of their evaluation. Business Insider also reports that Google has instructed its engineers to use AI for coding, while Amazon employees have requested the company to adopt AI coding tool Cursor. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of AI has made most employees wary of being replaced by machines. Even experts and industry leaders have been warning about this trend: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that it could wipe out half of white-collar jobs in the U.S., while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that it could cause up to 20% unemployment in the next half-decade. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory study even created a labor simulation tool that estimates that up to 11.7% of workers are in danger of being replaced by AI. Nevertheless, Jensen Huang has reportedly reassured his employees that they are not in danger of being supplanted by this technology. Despite implementing the use of AI tools, Nvidia has continuously been hiring people, bringing in over 6,000 new faces in its last fiscal year. And amid the increasing tech industry layoffs, Huang says that the company probably needs about 10,000 more staff members. It makes sense for Huang and Nvidia to push their people into using AI. After all, it’s the reason that the once-gaming GPU maker has become the first company in the world to hit a $5-trillion market capitalization. But it’s just a tool that can enhance the productivity of employees, not something that should replace them entirely.

Title: Uh-oh, accounting concerns circle the AI boom

UPDATED 10:53 EST / NOVEMBER 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof As investors start to care about returns from all the spending on artificial intelligence, accounting is becoming a big topic of concern. In his Breaking Analysis this week, Dave Vellante makes the case that GPUs have plenty of legs, quelling most concerns that lengthening depreciation times are a red flag. That said, Meta is particularly, shall we say, creative, when it comes to accounting for, or not accounting for, its multibillion-dollar spending on data centers. Sharpening the concern over AI’s payoff is that the current generative approaches may soon reach their limit, as another AI expert opined this week. Still, the AI we’ve got so far will pack quite a punch. As Paul Gillin writes in his latest feature, agentic AI soon will software like a tidal wave. Meantime, it was full speed ahead this week on new models and tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other activity. After Jeff Bezos scraped up some change under his couch cushions to raise $6.2 billion for his secretive industrial AI “startup” Project Prometheus, it turns out he has already made an acquisition. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev also raised $120 million for Harmonic AI to eliminate hallucinations. And AI is still helping enterprise tech providers, though to varying degrees. Dell and NetApp cleaned up on earnings, but HP fell short and announced thousands of layoffs, and Nutanix didn’t do so great either. Amazon Web Services will hold its annual re:Invent confab next week, and I’m not revealing anything by saying it will be all about AI. Fair or not, Amazon has a bit to prove it can catch up in that realm to OpenAI — which some observers speculate it will announce a deal with — as well as partner Anthropic, Microsoft and a surging Google. But this week it announced it will invest $50 billion to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for the U.S. government, so it’s hardly standing still. SiliconANGLE and theCUBE will be onsite at the event in Las Vegas with all the news, interviews and analysis. Next week there’s also a post-Thanksgiving glut of earnings from Salesforce, Snowflake, HPE, UiPath, CrowdStrike, Pure Storage and more that should provide further insight into the sustainability of the AI boom. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: The end of apps? Imagining software’s agentic future Breaking Analysis: Resetting GPU depreciation: Why AI factories bend, but don’t break, useful life assumptions It’s worrisome when accounting becomes a central issue in tech business, but here’s a good analysis of why new depreciation assumptions are one of the biggest problems. AI meets aggressive accounting at Meta’s gigantic new data center (per the Wall Street Journal) This is pretty damning, especially coming from the reporter who first broke the iffy accounting at Enron back in 2000. Worth a careful read. “Artificial intelligence, meet artificial accounting.” Ouch! Ilya Sutskever declares the scaling era dead. His $3B bet says research will win Another AI pioneer weighs in, following Yann LeCun last week. Hmm. If scaling isn’t the key, who needs all those data centers?

Title: 6 companies that have signaled they are replacing human employees with AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/list-companies-replacing-human-employees-with-ai-layoffs-workforce-reductions
Time Published: 2025-11-28T13:02:04Z

Worries about AI one day replacing human workers have intensified in recent years — and as it turns out, that future has already arrived. MIT just released a study that found that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labor market. The study utilized a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which models 151 million US workers and measures how AI overlaps with skills in each occupation. As AI starts to replace human workers, companies have been increasingly open about the role AI adoption is playing in recent layoffs. However, while some companies have directly cited AI as a reason for workforce reductions, others have vacillated with their messaging, leaving ambiguity around the exact reasoning and whether AI is directly replacing workers. Even as some companies replace human workers with AI, they might end up hiring more people in other roles because of it. A World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally are expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of AI. Meanwhile, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, the WEF said. Here's a list of companies that are replacing — or signaling they may replace — humans with AI. HP said it's reducing the size of its corporate workforce as a result of AI initiatives. In an earnings report on Tuesday, the company said it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028, estimating the changes would save around $1 billion. HP's earnings presentation said part of its strategy was to cut costs through "workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation, and productivity measures" and to increase customer satisfaction, innovation, and productivity with "artificial intelligence adoption and enablement." Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that it had replaced hundreds of human resources employees with AI. More recently, the company announced in November that it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter of 2025, affecting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce." Its CEO, Arvind Krishna, said the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. He also said the company plans to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. Krishna has also said AI adoption has led to the company hiring more employees in programming and sales. In 2023, Krishna told Bloomberg that IBM had halted or slowed hiring for back-office roles, like in human resources, that could be replaced by AI. "I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period," he told the outlet at the time. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink the retail giant's workforce in the coming years — but when the company announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs in October, Jassy said the cuts were about culture, not AI. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said in the company's most recent earnings call. "It really — it's culture." An Amazon spokesperson also reiterated to Business Insider that the cuts were not driven by AI. When the layoffs were announced, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology wrote in a blog post that the move reflected a continued effort to run the company "like the world's largest startup." The SVP, Beth Galetti, also referenced a need to be leaner in the age of AI. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before," Galetti wrote in the post. In an episode of "The Logan Bartlett Show" released in August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company was using AI agents in the customer support division to replace humans and help the company work through more sales leads. "I was able to rebalance my head count on my support," he said in the interview. "I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads." A Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider that Benioff was referencing an organizational transformation that took place over several months to reshape its customer support function. After deploying Agentforce, the company no longer needed to "actively backfill support engineer roles," the spokesperson said, adding that it successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas of the company, like professional services, sales, and customer success. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in 2024 that the company could operate effectively with half its current staff. A spokesperson for the company said its AI assistant now handles the equivalent workload of 853 full-time agents, up from 700 at launch. That's saving an estimated $58 million annually, the spokesperson said. After its CEO acknowledged that previous cost-cutting measures had gone too far, the buy-now-pay-later firm redeployed workers to customer support roles. However, the spokesperson said that Siemiatkowski's comments were in reference to outsourced support quality, not limitations of AI. The recent in-house hires were a "tiny pilot" of under 10 people aimed at improving the quality of outsourced agents, not replacing AI, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the company never removed human support entirely, and it still works with outsourced teams of around 2,000. Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of Fiverr, said in September that the company was slashing roughly 30% of its workforce. The cut would affect about 250 team members, and the freelancing platform had 762 full-time employees as of 2024, according to an SEC filing. The CEO said that the cuts were needed to help turn Fiverr into a leaner and faster "AI-first company." Kaufman said in a staff memo in April that AI was "coming for your jobs," and in May, he told Business Insider that Fiverr would only hire people who know how to use AI. "If you don't ensure that you sharpen your knives, you're going to be left behind. It's that simple," Kaufman said.Correction: December 1, 2025 — The bullet points of this article have been updated to clarify Amazon's statements about how AI may affect its workforce. Jump to

Title: Amazon placed him on a PIP. Here's how he bought himself time to find a new job.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Michael Permana learned that his time as a software engineer at Amazon might be running out, he made an interesting decision: he took paternity leave. In late February 2023, Permana was placed on a PIP. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in Fremont, California. He began applying for jobs right away, but knew it could take a while to land something new. He had a mortgage to pay, so he decided to buy himself roughly two months of breathing room by using the remainder of his paternity leave from when his daughter was born. By temporarily stepping away from work — and the scrutiny that came with being on a PIP — he figured he could prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role. "I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said. Permana is among the Americans who have taken steps to prepare for unemployment in a corporate landscape where, for some, job security feels less dependable than it once did. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers laid off by large corporations that are implementing strategic changes — including eliminating management layers, shifting investments toward AI, letting go of underperforming employees, and cutting costs across the board. While some workers had a sense their roles might be eliminated, others said they were caught off guard — pointing to their tenure, clean performance records, and the financial strength of their employers. Permana shared how he landed a new role after a challenging search — and offered advice for others facing performance pressure. When reached for comment, Amazon said that it regularly reviews its performance evaluation process to ensure it best supports the growth and development of its employees. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies such as applying for jobs before trouble strikes, launching side businesses, or secretly juggling multiple jobs. In Permana's case, at least he had some warning, and paternity leave bought him some time to look for his next gig. That doesn't mean his job search was easy. His two main search strategies were applying to software engineering roles on LinkedIn and exploring opportunities through recruiters he connected with on the platform. Permana landed a few interviews at Meta, Instawork, and HubSpot, but was ultimately rejected from all of them. He said he tried applying to the software company SnapLogic, where he'd worked more than a decade previously, but was denied there as well. "It was very hard," he said, adding that he still has a "collection" of rejection emails he's compiled for tracking purposes. By the time Permana returned from paternity leave in May, he still hadn't landed a new job, and he continued to feel that his performance was under scrutiny. However, he soon advanced in the interview process for a software engineering role at the mobile game developer MobilityWare. A friend who worked there referred him for the position, which he believes helped him get an interview. In late May, Permana received an offer. In June, his tenure at Amazon came to an end, and he began the new role — a remote position that offered the flexibility he was looking for. Permana said he enjoyed the job but recently left for a software engineering role at the mobile messaging platform Attentive, citing higher pay as a key reason for the switch. When it comes to navigating a performance improvement plan, Permana said his best advice is to communicate openly with your manager and focus on doing exactly what they're asking of you. However, he also believes it's wise to assume things might not work out — and to start applying for jobs elsewhere. As for advice on landing a software engineering role, Permana said his two biggest tips are to seek out referrals whenever possible and to dedicate significant time to interview preparation. He recalled that Meta's interview process, for example, included coding questions that required extensive prep. One question, he said, touched on a concept he hadn't thought about in the last two decades of his career. Permana believes the questions were so demanding that it would be difficult for any working professional to find enough time to prepare properly. "You'd have to study for a few months to be able to do those questions," he said. Reviewing questions on LeetCode, a coding interview prep website, helped him prepare for interviews at Meta and elsewhere — but he said it still required a significant time investment. Permana's advice: Find ways to carve out enough time for your job search — even if it doesn't involve taking paternity leave. Jump to

Title: Goldman Sachs flags 'growing signs of weakness' in the US jobs market as layoffs mount

Every time Reed publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Goldman Sachs researchers are warning that the US labor market may be starting to soften as private-sector data show a growing wave of layoffs across several industries, the Wall Street bank said in a new report. The firm said state filings related to planned mass layoffs have surged to their highest level since 2016, excluding the pandemic spike — the sharpest increase Goldman has tracked in nearly a decade. Layoff announcements compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks corporate job cuts, had by October climbed to a level previously unseen outside of a recession, the report noted, citing cuts in sectors like tech, industrial goods, and food and beverage as factors that drove the increase. Goldman's economists said the combination of rising layoff signals is concerning — representing "growing signs of weakness" — because workers are increasingly struggling to secure new employment, making rebounding after losing a paycheck especially difficult. Even some of corporate America's biggest names haven't evaded the job market's cooling. Amazon, for example, announced plans this fall to eliminate about 14,000 corporate jobs as it seeks to streamline and embrace AI. "A sustained increase in layoffs would be particularly concerning because the hiring rate for workers is low and it is harder than usual for the unemployed to find jobs," economists Manuel Abecasis and Pierfrancesco Mei wrote. The state filings Goldman cited — known as Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices — are required by companies with more than 100 employees in advance of instituting layoffs. They're a helpful indicator of employer behavior, signaling when cuts may be around the corner. On top of the rise in WARN notices, the bank found that the leadership of more publicly traded companies had begun openly discussing potential layoffs on recent earnings calls with shareholders. Taken together with the Challenger outplacement data, the picture strongly suggests more companies are considering trims and efficiencies in the coming months. Still, the bank said weekly jobless claims remain low, which means government reports might not yet reflect the full extent of deterioration in the labor market. A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report for September surpassed economists' expectations. But Goldman noted that claims tend to lag private layoff trackers by about two months, which could hint at a potential uptick in federal data about job losses as winter continues. And although concerns have grown about whether artificial intelligence is pushing companies to reduce headcount, Goldman said current evidence does not show that AI is meaningfully driving the latest layoffs. "While AI may be increasingly considered in workforce decisions," the Goldman researchers wrote, "clear evidence of layoffs directly motivated by AI remains limited." Jump to
