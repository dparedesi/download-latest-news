Title: How to Stay Ahead of AI as an Early-Career Engineer

As AI takes on more work, expectations for entry-level roles grow “AI is not going to take your job. The person who uses AI is going to take your job.” This is an idea that has become a refrain for, among others, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has publicly made the prediction several times since October 2023. Meanwhile, other AI developers and stalwarts say the technology will eliminate countless entry-level jobs. These predictions have come at the same time as reports of layoffs at companies including IBM and Amazon, causing anxiety for tech workers—especially those starting their careers, whose responsibilities are often more easily automated. Early reports have borne out some of these anxieties in employment data. For example, entry-level hiring at the 15 biggest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024, according to a report from SignalFire last May. Still, it’s unclear what the long-term effects will be, or whether hiring cuts are actually a result of AI. For instance, while Meta laid off 600 employees from its AI division in October (and continued hiring other AI researchers), OpenAI began hiring junior software engineers. This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2026. In 2026, all new graduates may face a tougher job market in the United States. Employers’ rating of the job market for college graduates is now at its most pessimistic since 2020, according to data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook 2026 survey. However, 49 percent of respondents still consider the job market “good” or “very good.” So, what does the rise of generative AI mean for early-career engineers? “This is a tectonic shift,” says Hugo Malan, president of the science, engineering, technology and telecom reporting unit within the staffing agency Kelly Services. AI agents aren’t poised to replace workers one-to-one, though. Instead, there will be a realignment of which jobs are needed, and what those roles look like. When publicly available AI tools first arrived, Malan says the expectation was that jobs like call-center roles would be most vulnerable. “But what nobody predicted was that the biggest impact by far would be on programmers,” a trend he attributes to the relatively solitary and highly structured nature of the work. He notes that, while other economic conditions also factor into the job market, the pace of programmer employment decline has accelerated since generative AI came on the scene. In the United States, overall programmer employment fell a dramatic 27.5 percent between 2023 and 2025, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. But employment for software developers—a distinct, more design-oriented position in the government data—only fell 0.3 percent in the same period. At the same time, some positions, such as information security analyst and AI engineer are actually growing, Malan says. “There’s been this pretty dramatic readjustment of the job landscape, even with as narrow a field as IT. Within IT, some jobs have exploded, like InfoSec analysts have grown in double digits, whereas programmers declined double digits” over the past few years, he says. (Eventually, Malan says he expects generative AI to affect all intellectual work.) Job responsibilities also appear to be changing. For recent graduates pursuing roles labeled as software-engineering jobs, “they’re not necessarily just coding,” says Jamie Grant, senior associate director for the engineering team at the University of Pennsylvania’s career services. “There tends to be so much higher-order thinking and knowledge of the software-development life cycle,” as well as a need to work with other parties, such as understanding user and client demands, she says. In her work advising Penn students, Grant hears concerns about AI’s effects on the job market from many engineering students and their parents. But during conversations with them, she says she tries to maintain an ethos of “we can make this work for us, not against us.” According to a report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, jobs involving tasks that could be automated with AI appear to be more susceptible to early-career employment dips than those where AI augments an employee’s ability to perform their job. The NACE data supports this: Sixty-one percent of employers say they are not replacing entry-level jobs with AI, while 41 percent are discussing or planning to augment these jobs with AI within the next five years. Over the past few years, computer-programmer employment in the United States has dropped sharply—but overall employment in the computing industry hasn’t seen the same decline. “Think about an exoskeleton that you could wear that allows you to lift 1,000 pounds,” Grant says. “AI should be, just as the people at Stanford say, an augmentation to your work, to your higher-order critical-thinking skills.” That being said, she advises students to be cautious of the risks, such as sharing sensitive or proprietary information with a chatbot. At this point, Grant thinks proficiency with AI tools is an unwritten expectation of many employers. But students and early-career workers should also recognize where AI can’t help. “AI can’t necessarily be with you in that moment of negotiation or of client-relationship development,” she says. “You still need to be able to perform at your highest level of capabilities.” And foundational skills like problem solving and communication are consistently prioritized by employers. With AI tools performing more of the “grunt work” that has served as a training ground for early-career workers, expectations for recent graduates are high. In the past, junior engineers have cultivated proficiency while doing simpler, more task-oriented work. “But if all of those are going to get taken over, you need to slot in at a higher level almost from day one,” Malan says. This leaves recent graduates in a difficult spot. To help students prepare, the education system will likely need to change, for instance by encouraging students to become proficient using AI and take on more hands-on, experiential learning. Today’s employers are looking for demonstrated skills, says Grant. “If you’re just going to class and doing projects and maybe getting a great GPA, that’s amazing. But you also need to be applying what you’re learning,” she says. Industry experience and demonstrated proficiencies are among the top factors considered by employers surveyed in NACE’s Job Outlook 2026. One solution may even lie in entirely different educational models, like apprenticeship. “Often, students in a more traditional computer-software degree program get a lot of theoretical knowledge,” but they may not have much experience building software on a team, says Mike Roberts, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Creating Coding Careers. Recent graduates may not be ready to ship code on day one—but AI can. Apprenticeship allows students to learn on the job in a structured program, and helps “to much more effectively close the experience gap,” Roberts says. Training the next generation of humans might also better serve the long-term interests of employers, he says. In today’s software engineering, many companies tend to be short-sighted in their hiring, thinking more of the next quarter than four or five years down the line. But “if you don’t train new early entrants into the market, you will eventually have no more people becoming mid-levels,” says Roberts. “It’s very myopic.” Also, AI can help ramp up new employees faster than ever. “I find it an exciting time, because it’s never been faster to build high-quality software,” Roberts says. “But it’s weird that folks are not seeing the virtue of continuing to invest in humans.” Gwendolyn Rak is an assistant editor at IEEE Spectrum covering consumer electronics and careers.

Whoever wins… we lose? Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts If Warner Bros. Discovery was only a movie house, it would have had one of its best years ever. Two of its films (One Battle After Another and Sinners) are front-runners for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it had a string of critical hits and box-office successes with Superman, Weapons, and A Minecraft Movie. But the company is a media conglomerate that counts HBO and CNN among the brands it owns, and it took on lots of debt; its box-office success in 2025 is not enough to make up for its financial struggles. This year, the company found itself up for auction. After over a hundred years as a major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. fate seemed unclear. Now months into a process that Netflix formally won, Paramount still hopes to come out on top with a hostile bid. This week even, the billionaire Larry Ellison, whose son, David, controls Paramount, offered a personal guarantee for the deal. The bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is a business story that morphed into a future-of-entertainment story and then recently took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump weighed in, saying he would be “involved” in deciding who wins, which put every party on alert that Trump might be particularly watching what happens to CNN, a cable network he has called “the least trusted name in news” and a “political arm of the Democrat Party.” Trump has sued ABC News, CBS News, the BBC, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. His administration has federally defunded PBS and NPR, and put pressure on networks to cancel late-night shows. In the Warner Bros. Discovery bidding war, Trump has hinted that he leans toward Paramount, and this week brought new claims of political interference of the news at the Ellison-run Paramount. 60 Minutes pulled a segment on the harsh conditions at a prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans earlier this year. Bari Weiss, the new head of CBS News, said the story needed more work even though it had apparently been fact-checked and legally vetted, not to mention promoted on air. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to the Atlantic film critic David Sims about what the outcome of this deal might mean for movie lovers, especially those who hope to keep going to movies in theaters. And we talk to our staff writer Frank Foer about Trump’s increasing influence on the media landscape and his subtle campaign to disappear CNN. The following is a transcript of the episode: Hanna Rosin: I know we’re months from the Oscars, but will you name your top-three picks for Best Picture? David Sims: In terms of who I think may well win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: Or who I want to win? Rosin: Mm. Sims: (Laughs.) Rosin: I think I’m gonna go with want. I think I’m gonna go with want. That’s— Sims: I’ve got the same pick for both, honestly, is I do think One Battle After Another will win out; I would say Sinners and Hamnet are the other sort of big players right now. Rosin: I was hoping you would say One Battle After Another and Sinners, only so I could have a smooth transition into the conversation I want to have with you. Sims: Absolutely. [Music] Rosin: One Battle After Another and Sinners, two front-runners for the Oscar for Best Picture, both came out of the same studio this year: Warner Bros. Sims: Those are movies from very established filmmakers with big stars in them. Leonardo DiCaprio (as Bob Ferguson in One Battle After Another): My name is Bob Ferguson. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of me, all right? I was part of French 75. Sims: But they were for grown-ups. These are R-rated movies. Michael B. Jordan (as Elijah “Smoke” Moore in Sinners): Y’all Klan? Jack O’Connell (as Remmick in Sinners): Sir. We believe in equality and music. Sims: They were going up against more established franchise stuff, and they dominated the conversation. Rosin: This is Atlantic movie critic David Sims. Sims: They did well in every kind of space. Rosin: It was also the same studio that made Weapons, Superman, and A Minecraft Movie— critical hits, along with box-office successes—movies for families and movies for families who like Paul Thomas Anderson. Sims: They had the kind of year studio executives dream of. Rosin: So what better way to end a banner year at Warner Bros. Pictures than by selling it? This fall, Warner Bros. Discovery—which includes all of its movie studios, HBO, DC Comics, and a bunch of other things—announced that it was on the market. An initial front-runner was Paramount. Sims: So Paramount was there—it was an existing movie studio, recently bought by David Ellison after he spent years trying to take it over. He’s the son of Larry Ellison. He’s a very, very rich tech billionaire. Rosin: But their bid was rejected. So Paramount kept submitting more bids, and those were all rejected too. Meanwhile (Netflix sound effect plays.) Netflix was also interested and swooped in. Wolf Blitzer (from CNN): New this morning, Netflix has inked a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to buy the iconic TV and movie studio and its streaming assets, including HBO. We should mention— [Music] Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. The bidding war for Warner Bros. is a business story that’s morphing into an entertainment story and then took an ominous turn into politics. President Donald Trump: So we’ll have to see what happens. Rosin: Recently, President Donald Trump weighed in on the matter, suggesting that he was personally interested in the outcome—which adds a whole new layer of complication. Trump: And I’ll be involved in that decision too. But they have a very big market share. For those of us who care more about the movies? The truth is that both options might make them a little worse—for different reasons. And for those of us who care most about democracy? It would not be the first time that the president has inserted himself into the business of media. We’ll talk to staff writer Frank Foer about that later. But first, critic David Sims on what he pays the most attention to: What does this Warner Bros. Discovery deal mean for the movies when the number of big movie studios just keeps shrinking? Sims: Obviously, this is a looming nightmare that Hollywood has been worried about for longer than the last few months. And for the last few years, Warner Bros., which is one part of a big conglomeration of TV networks and other stuff has been a company that’s sort of laden with debt and has had some bad corporate owners in the past, that’s been passed around, so a lot of people have been waiting to see who will swoop in to sort of salvage the company or transform it. And the fear’s always been, It’ll get sucked up too. The Hollywood studios will continue to sort of condense into a bigger and bigger blob, which, really, it means nothing good for art, unfortunately. Rosin: Okay, well, slow that down ’cause you said “fear”—you’re separating, already, in your answer quality from financial stability. So it was a studio that made good movies but was financially not stable, I guess, for a while, so why “fear”—why don’t we see this as rescuing Warner Bros.? Sims: Well, Warner Bros., the movie studio itself, there’s not a huge profit issue there. That’s the sort of jewel of the company, along with HBO, which is part of this corporate consideration. It’s the other stuff that’s been the problem, and David Zaslav, who’s been running the company for a few years at this point, since it merged with Discovery, has been trying to cut fat. He’s laid people off. He’s canceled whole movies outright. He’s been running it pretty lean, and I think everyone in the industry has been watching and sort of noting that he’s clearly preparing to get acquired. Now, in the old days, Warner Bros. used to be owned by AT&T. Before then, it was owned by AOL. Back in the day, Coca-Cola used to own one of the movie studios. Big companies would own movie studios ’cause it was fun to own a movie studio—you would get to be a player in Hollywood, and you would have glitz and glamour. But now, it feels like the only companies that want these movie studios are other movie studios. Rosin: So let me ask you: If, for years and years, big companies have owned movie studios, why is this moment such a big deal? Why do people like you talk about it with trepidation in their voices—nd “people like you,” I mean people who love movies and movie theaters and just the whole tradition of Hollywood? Why is this any different than Coca-Cola or anybody else? Sims: Well, so it feels like there’s two outcomes to this Warner Bros. deal, it seems, and both of them are causing agita for different reasons. [Music] Sims: If Paramount, which is another big studio, had bought Warner Bros., you have what happened to Disney and Fox, probably, happening again, so Fox still exists in some form, as a sort of subsidiary of Disney—t releases a few movies a year—but you’ve kind of dried up one of the wells of big movie production in Hollywood. If that happens with Paramount owning Warner Bros., once again, you feel the pool of big movies shrinking in Hollywood. You feel this sort of competition shrinking. Now, Netflix is this kind of different beast because they operate a different model. They’ve made money a different way. Obviously, they’re all in on streaming. So far, they’ve sort of communicated publicly, like, Oh, no, no, no. Warner Bros. is a different business than ours, and we wouldn’t wanna kill its theatrical industry. But because Netflix has been so uniquely aggressive about sort of getting their movies onto TV rather than in theaters, there’s this just huge anxiety amongst people like me and people who make movies that the movie-theater industry just cannot survive losing that many movies a year, if that’s where this is going. Rosin: Why are theatrical—this is not obvious to me. It seems to me—what I care about is that good movies get made. Why is theatergoing the lifeblood of good movies? Does it change the incentive structure of what kind of movies you make and how good or creative or original they are? Sims: Possibly. Look, Netflix has made good movies, but there is a sort of style to a lot of Netflix movies—the more sort of generic stuff that they put out: the rom-coms and the sort of medium-size dramas, whatever—that feels like the movie’s a little more designed to be ignored. Rosin: Mm. Sims: Now— Rosin: Ah, now I understand it. (Laughs.) That feels like a real concern—if you’re creating movies that you know people are going to be checking their phone while watching. Sims: I think when you talk to the sort of older guard in Hollywood, who are especially worried about the mortality of theaters, there’s also just this feeling of, like, When it’s gone, it won’t come back. [Music] Sims: And all of those companies are—they’ve been battered by COVID, they were hurt by the strikes, which really reduced the amount of output lately, and they’re kind of hanging on by a thread right now. Big movies will come out and do well and kind of demonstrate that audiences are fine going to the theater for something they’re interested in. But it’s tougher for a sort of mid-sized or smaller movie to break out in the ways that they used to—which is why, again, one reason that something like Sinners or One Battle, those films catching on with people is heartening to see because it kind of defies the prediction that companies like Netflix are making of, Ah, well, that old model, that’s sort of dinosaur stuff, and people prefer to just have an a la carte selection at home of whatever they can watch. Rosin: So we’ve been discussing the Netflix outcome. Tell me what happened with Paramount and what’s the Paramount outcome. How do you see that differently than what you’ve just described? Sims: I think one reason the Netflix bid seems to have won is that Netflix was cool with Warner Bros., the company, sort of splitting up and its cable channels—these sort of less profitable units—getting spun off and turned into a division that can be dealt with elsewhere or sold off or who knows. And Netflix would take control of kind of the big properties: Warner Bros., HBO, things like that. Paramount seems to want the whole kit and caboodle; they want everything. They’re willing to pay a lot for it. And it’s a little harder to understand why, outside of, I guess, just this notion of, We need to be as big as possible to compete. Paramount on its own used to be a very venerable—it’s still venerable, but now they don’t have a Marvel, and they don’t have the kind of streaming service that Netflix or HBO is. So if they can just kind of grow by acquisition, grow by expanding into new areas of storytelling—they can make more comic-book movies, whatever—that’s their argument for: This is the best way to survive. That might be true for Paramount. It might lead to a lot of layoffs and a lot of consolidation as well. There’s literally just less movies in theaters than there used to be. And so consolidation, you imagine more of that. Rosin: Right. So whatever the details, you see this as a lose-lose for Hollywood. Sims: Oh God, I hate to be so pessimistic. I’m usually not the pessimist, I will say. But it’s tough for me to see either of these being smooth. Both of these will be strange corporate maneuvers. It currently seems like the Netflix thing will happen. But, obviously, Paramount’s exploring this idea of a hostile bid. Combining Netflix and HBO, you’ve got two of the biggest streaming services—that’s a whole mess that maybe regulators won’t object to. There’s the Trump factor of terms of he maybe prefers a bidder—maybe he doesn’t, though? A lot of the reporting seems to suggest maybe he wasn’t as swayed by the Ellisons as the Ellisons thought he would be. Who knows? All of this is very difficult to foresee. And I think Warner Bros. did not really see this coming. The old rumor was that they wanted Universal, who’s another studio, to get them, and those two powers would combine into something very, very powerful. This is weird in a new way, and it’s kind of like the story of Hollywood of, every year, there’s sort of a new evolution of weird that everyone in the industry just has to wrestle with. Rosin: David, thank you so much for joining us today. Sims: Happy to. Anytime. [Music] Rosin: After the break, Frank Foer on what happens if Trump does intervene on this deal. And remember: Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t just in the movie business. They also own CNN. [Break] Rosin: The movies are just one part of this Warner Bros. Discovery deal. As we’ll hear from staff writer Frank Foer, politics is another. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, President Donald Trump privately told people that he wanted this deal to be a competition, to have one side bid against the other for his approval of the deal. Frank Foer: Because, ultimately, in order to get a merger of this size through, it needs to be blessed by the U.S. government. And it seems like the biggest condition that he’s laid out there is CNN. Rosin: CNN. Okay, so you think that’s his main interest. What does he want from CNN? Foer: So Warner Bros. owns CNN, and I think that he hates CNN, that he says it’s run by corrupt, terrible people, and he wants to see them out. Does that mean that he wants to see CNN kind of left on the side of the road to wither and die? Does it mean that he wants the new buyer to come in and renovate CNN in the same sort of way that the Ellisons have come in to CBS News and installed Bari Weiss and to turn that into a different type of news-gathering organization? It’s unclear. I don’t think Trump knows. I think he’s waiting for the bidders to come and present him with the best prize. Rosin: Okay. I think I need to understand how unusual this level of intervention is. What is the president’s usual official role in a big merger like this? Foer: So the whole United States government is set up to avoid this type of direct political meddling. [Music] Foer: We have agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, which were set up almost a hundred years ago, or more than a hundred years ago in the case of the FTC. And they were supposed to be independent agencies, where you had a set of commissioners—you would have three from the party in charge, two from the out party—where they would make decisions in a relatively bipartisan, technocratic way, in the best interest of the government, so that you didn’t have presidents coming in and picking winners and losers. But I think it’s pretty clear that, in the end, he’s got a little bit of a rooting interest for Paramount, but he doesn’t wanna make it seem as if he’s putting his thumb on the scale, because that would be bad—that would send bad signals to the world, bad signals to the market. And so, even if he may gesture in the direction of Paramount, I think even Donald Trump knows that he needs to make it look like an open and fair competition. Rosin: Got it. So he’s, basically, somewhat aware of the kinds of criticisms that a person like Frank Foer at The Atlantic might make, is, This is inappropriate. Foer: Right. This is a transaction, and so Warner Bros. has shareholders who have to approve a merger themselves and sign up for a deal; they initially signed up to give their company to Netflix. And really, there is a bidding war going on, and part of the bidding war is that—what Paramount says that it brings to the table is that it can get the approval of the president of the United States; it can make it a much more painless transaction than the Netflix purchase. Rosin: It’s like they’ve already acceded to a world in which the president’s approval or disapproval actually makes a difference in how you do business. It’s like we live in that world now. Foer: Yeah, yeah. And Netflix understands that too; that’s why Ted Sarandos went and visited—the CEO of Netflix went and visited Donald Trump in the Oval Office himself. This is the world that we live in. Rosin: So let’s play out the scenario under Trump. What moves has he already made to exert influence over media? Foer: Right. So we could look at what’s happened to The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: During the first Trump term, Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post—or he bought it before Trump—but he recreated the paper, essentially, as a resistance paper: Democracy dies in darkness. Jeff Bezos: It is a mistake for any elected official, in my opinion, to attack media and journalists. I believe that— (Audience claps.) Foer: And Trump sees this happening, and he sees the Super Bowl ad they make. Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free. (Music swells.) Foer: And he starts to tweet about how Jeff Bezos is a corrupt guy and that he’s gonna take revenge against Amazon, which he says is doing all sorts of unfair things. TV anchor (from CNBC): President Trump going after Amazon again, this time in a series of tweets. He writes: “So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN.” Lobbyists for Amazon— Foer: So Bezos sees this happening and he, I think, either consciously or subconsciously, decides that he’s gonna walk away from this resistance persona, and he’s gonna recreate the editorial board of The Washington Post, which he more directly controls, as being something that’s more politically sympathetic to Donald Trump. TV anchor (from CNN): —after the publisher announced that the newspaper will not endorse a candidate for president. That’s the first time they have not done so in 36 years of presidential elections. The Post itself— Foer: Or to take another example, we saw the way in which Brendan Carr, the [chairman] of the FCC, said stations that were carrying Jimmy Kimmel—that because of everything that Jimmy Kimmel had said about Charlie Kirk, that they were gonna pay a price. Brendan Carr (on The Benny Show): —changes that we’ve seen, but, frankly, when you see stuff like this—look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Foer: And it turned out that a lot of these companies were in the process of undergoing mergers and consolidations—they had a lot of deals sitting in front of the Trump administration—and so they heard his message, and they said, Okay, we’re pulling Jimmy Kimmel from the air. Rosin: Right, although they did say the decision to pull Kimmel wasn’t actually influenced by FCC communication. But, okay, so let’s overlay those dynamics onto the Warner Bros. sale. What does it look like? Play out what it could look like. Foer: So we’ve talked about CNN, which, I think, is kind of the most vulnerable asset there. I think that— Rosin: Wait, so what happens to CNN? Just—this is hypothetical. Foer: Right. So, hypothetically, they could either say that, We’re gonna buy CNN as part of this deal, and we’re just gonna kill CNN. Rosin: Paramount could, if Paramount— Foer: Paramount could do that. Rosin: —or Netflix. Foer: Or Netflix. Netflix doesn’t do news, and so they could just say, You know what? If it’s a cost of doing this transaction that you’re forcing us to buy CBS—anything is possible in this sort of world where these types of sums of money are on the table, and there’s an enormous amount of flexibility. The other scenario—and we’re seeing this with CBS News, which is kind of what I’d call the Orbánification scenario, where Viktor Orbán is the head of state in Hungary, and what he’s done is, essentially, ensured that the biggest media properties in that country are sold to his allies and cronies, who, in turn, neuter those networks or turn them into propaganda apparatus. And so there’s some possibility that that happens. But if Paramount decided to go through with that, it would be painful for Paramount. Rosin: But why? We just had a perfect model for that, which is: Bari Weiss takes over CBS; Erika Kirk is the first interview. Plenty of people got fired, but it happened. Foer: It happens; it’s not unthinkable. But CNN is different than CBS. CBS News is something that aims to be straight down the middle. CNN, I think, aims to be straight down the middle, but is, in fact, kind of an anti-Trump network. Rosin: I see, so it would be more obvious and much more of a fight. Foer: Yeah. You would lose more viewership that way. You’d lose hosts who, I think, have built personas around criticizing Trump. It would be messy. Rosin: Right. Okay, so that’s instability for us who work in this industry. But do the shifts in journalism matter for anyone else? Foer: Right, so if you take The Washington Post. [Music] Foer: The Washington Post editorial page had limited reach. But in terms of kind of national voices, there were three national newspapers, three editorial boards. You have The Wall Street Journal, which is already kind of right-wing, and then you take another one and you make it right wing, you’ve changed a substantial portion of the opinion space in national newspaper land. There are only three meaningful cable networks. One of them is already pro-Trump. You take another one off the table—you’re changing a substantial percentage of cable news. A democracy is basically only as good as the information that its citizenry gets, and so we are undergoing this long-term crisis where the quality of information that citizens get has been diminished—it’s more likely to be manipulated by algorithms or by outside actors—and that, if we ever have any chance of having a democratic revival in this country, we need there to be quality sources of information. Rosin: Sometimes I think back to the first days that Jimmy Kimmel was fired and what a shock that was to the country because that was the first time that such an overt pressure happened from the administration, which had such an obvious consequence for a well-known media figure. But then he was reinstated. So is there any hope in that? Foer: Yeah, I think that there is hope in that, because there was a public backlash. I think that it was a moment where they pushed too hard, and they went too far, and I think a lot of people who may have otherwise cowered or turned away felt compelled to push back. But, on the other hand, I just look at things relative to where they were in the first Trump term and the whole tenor of conversation. And in the first Trump term, I think a lot of media looked at outrageous things, and they responded with outrage. And here, this is not just because of all these larger economic tides that we’re talking about, but there is a greater numbness that, I think, prevails. It’s less red-blooded. It’s less full-throated. It’s more numb. Rosin: Thank you, Frank, for joining us today. Foer: My pleasure. [Music] Rosin: This episode of Radio Atlantic was produced by Jinae West.

A year full of upheavals, conflicts and developments with a global footprint is captured in the report of the Agence France-Presse (AFP) for 2025. From Donald Trump‘s tumultuous return to the White House and the fragile balances in the Middle East and Ukraine, to the social uprisings of Generation Z, colossal investments in artificial intelligence and record-breaking extreme weather events, ten events marked the year and shaped the international landscape, highlighting an era of intense uncertainty and profound change. Here is the review of 2025: Attack of protectionism, mass deportations of illegal immigrants, dismantling entire sections of the federal government… After returning in January to the White House for a second term, Republican Donald Trump has embarked on a barrage of measures under his doctrine of “America first”, making extensive use of executive orders, though the judiciary blocked some of his decisions. Disregarding, according to opponents, fundamental rights and other powers, he targeted opponents, sent militias into major cities led by Democrats, attempted to intimidate the media, and fought diversity and inclusion programs. He also developed intense diplomatic activity, with more or less success. Polls, however, show growing dissatisfaction among Americans on economic issues, especially the cost of living. Sound defeats in local polls have put his party in a vulnerable position ahead of the midterm presidential election in the fall of 2026. US pressure resulted in a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, two years after the devastating war in the Gaza Strip erupted following an unprecedented attack by the Islamist Palestinian movement Hamas on 7 October 2023 on Israeli soil. The ceasefire has allowed for a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, the exchange of the last hostages held alive in Gaza for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, and increased humanitarian aid entering Gaza, although that aid still falls significantly short of needs, according to the UN and non-governmental organizations. Israel is awaiting the return of one last hostage body before it begins consultations on the second phase of the ceasefire, a stage that, under the terms of the U.S.- and U.N.-endorsed plan, must lead to the demilitarization of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped that this second phase would begin “very soon, but violence continues to rock that territory, with both parties accusing each other of ceasefire violations. Regional tensions continue with continued Israeli strikes on the strongholds of the Shiite Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. Iran was also hit by Israeli and US raids on its nuclear facilities during a 12-day war in June with Israel, which erupted from an Israeli attack. In September, Israel targeted Hamas officials in an unprecedented attack in Qatar. Donald Trump’s return to power marked the first serious efforts aimed at ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The praise and blame of the US president fluctuated between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. In February, Donald Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president in front of cameras and inside the Oval Office, accusing him of being ungrateful to the United States. Direct talks between Russians and Ukrainians in Istanbul and then a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska failed to produce any concrete progress toward peace, and Washington announced sanctions against the Russian oil sector in October. International negotiations were nevertheless held in late November based on a US draft, the initial version of which was considered by Kiev and its European allies to be too favourable to Moscow. After a new round of talks with Trump’s envoys in December, Ukraine said “progress” had been made, though the issue of Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory remains at an impasse. On the front, the Russian military has continued its slow advance into the east, after completely pushing Ukrainian forces out of the Russian border region of Kursk in March. Moscow has stepped up its strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and the Ukrainian railway network, while Kiev is targeting oil facilities in Russia. Citing trade deals unfavorable to his country, Donald Trump announced in waves additional tariffson products imported into the United States, which varied depending on countries or zones of origin. It also imposed specific customs duties on sectors considered strategic (steel, aluminum or copper). As the targeted countries considered or implemented trade retaliation, they began tough negotiations that resulted in numerous agreements, such as with the European Union or, in late October, with China, marking the beginning of a truce in a conflict that shook the global economy. Bilateral negotiations were instead suspended with Canada after an anti-protectionist ad that the US president found offensive. Pushing to lower the cost of living for Americans, Donald Trump agreed in mid-November to cancel customs tariffs on certain foods, such as imported coffee and imported beef. Robert Francis Prevost became on 8 May, at the age of 69, the first American pope, following the death of his predecessor, Francis, to whom he was an adviser. The white smoke, announcing the election of the 267th head of the Catholic Church, rose over the Sistine Chapel after a brief conclave of cardinals that lasted less than 24 hours. Smiling and unassuming, Prevost, born in Chicago and counted among the moderate cardinals, took the name Leo XIV. The new pontiff, who was for nearly 20 years a missionary in Peru, whose citizenship he has taken, continues his predecessor’s work with social action for the poor, immigrants and ecology. At the same time, he also gave reassurances to conservative circles, allowing a traditional mass to resume in the Vatican after three years of restrictions. He ruled out in the short term the ordination of women as deacons or the recognition of same-sex marriage. In Asia, Africa, or Latin America, young people of Generation Z (under 30) have multiplied mobilizations for improved living conditions and against social media exclusion or elite corruption. They held marches in Peru against the growing insecurity and order of politicians, or in Morocco, where the authorities launched efforts in social sectors, but also prosecuted more than 2,000 people. In other countries, the protests, which were violently suppressed, developed into a wider challenge to power: after riots in Nepal, Maoist Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had no choice but to resign. In Madagascar, mobilisation led to the military overthrowing President Andri Rajoelina, who fled abroad. In Tanzania, young people participated en masse in post-election protests, which were drowned in blood. The pirate manga One Piece flag (a skull and crossbones with a straw hat), often carried by protesters, became an international symbol of the fight against oppression on social media. Tech giants and niche startups are spending increasingly colossal sums to fund the frenzied development of artificial intelligence. According to US research and advisory firm Gartner, global spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach around $1.5 trillion in 2025 (+50% in a year) and exceed $2 trillion next year. The sector’s astronomical stock market valuations -those of US microprocessor giant Nvidia had at one point surpassed the unprecedented $5 trillion level- are, however, causing fears in the markets of a potential speculative bubble. The concerns caused by artificial intelligence were moreover fuelled by numerous examples of misinformation, accusations of copyright infringement or mass layoffs, notably at Amazon. The parents of a teenager in California who committed suicide even accused OpenAI’s AI assistant ChatGPT of encouraging their child’s suicide with specific advice. Since then, the startup has stepped up parental controls, and California has enacted legislation that regulates so-called “chatbots.” On October 19, thugs in workmen’s vests broke into the famous Parisian Louvre museum in broad daylight, using a lift normally used for removals, after breaking a glass panel. They then broke into exhibit windows and stole crown jewels, estimated to be worth 88 million euros, all within eight minutes. Escaping on a scooter, they dropped the crown of Empress Eugenia (wife of Napoleon III), which was found damaged. This spectacular burglary at the Louvre was commented on around the world and brought to light the security failings of the world’s most famous museum. Charges have been laid against four men suspected of being part of the burglary group, but no loot has been found so far. Washington has deployed a significant military force off Venezuela since August, officially to combat drug smuggling destined for the United States. A series of strikes have been carried out in recent weeks in the Caribbean and Pacific against vessels suspected of carrying drugs, causing the deaths of about 100 people in operations whose legality is questioned by experts. Caracas sees this as a pretext aimed at overthrowing President Nicolas Maduro and seizing the country’s oil reserves. After arresting an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude on December 10, Washington announced a “complete blockade” of “sanctioned oil tankers” that sail to or from Venezuela. Washington accuses Nicolas Maduro of heading a cartel and offers a $50 million reward for his capture. Killer floods, severe storms. Extreme weather events have succeeded one another, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate deregulation caused by human activity, according to scientists. Cyclone Melissa, one of the most powerful to ever sweep the Caribbean, devastated entire regions of Jamaica and flooded Haiti and Cuba. In Southeast Asia, the Philippines was hit in less than two months by Typhoons Ragasha, Kalmagi and Fung-wong. Vietnam was devastated by storms, floods, and landslides, while two tropical storms claimed hundreds of lives late in the year in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. As temperatures rose, forest fires intensified in Europe, and record forest acres burned during the summer. In the US, fires started by lightning caused the northern section of the famous Grand Canyon in Arizona to close in mid-July for the rest of the tourist season. Explore related questions

U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 20 fell by 10,000 to 214,000 from the previous week's 224,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's below the 232,000 new applications forecast of analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet. The weekly report was released a day early due to the Christmas holiday.

Last week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation.

Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring.

AIBiggest DisappointmentsKotaku 2025LayoffsMindsEyeTariffsTrump I’d hoped 2025 would be a better year than 2024. And in some personal ways, it was. But it was also yet another year filled with layoffs, AI slop, greedy execs, price increases, and more signs that the entire game industry is collapsing. So, like we’ve done in years past, Kotaku has rounded up a collection of some of the worst, most disappointing video game news and events from 2025 and catalogued it in a handy dandy list. Take breaks as you scroll through this, and let’s all hope 2026 is better. It can’t be worse, right? Please, tell me it can’t be worse. Please… This was the year in which, more than ever before, a lot of big games got canned, or we learned about projects that were binned not long ago. Perfect Dark, the slick-looking reboot of Rare’s sci-fi shooter series? Canned, and the studio behind it shuttered. A Wonder Woman game from Monolith? Canceled taking the beloved studio behind No One Lives Forever and Shadow of Mordor down with it. An EA-published Black Panther game from some former Monolith devs that would have reportedly featured a version of Mordor’s popular Nemesis System? Dead and the studio behind it closed, too. EA also shelved a Titanfall extraction shooter spin-off; Sony killed a few live-service games, including a God of War multiplayer project; and a cool-looking Transformers game from Splash Damage got the axe this year, leading to, you guessed it, layoffs. And these are just the ones that we know about. I’d bet a lot more games were canceled in 2025 as publishers continue to focus more and more on fewer franchises that can be reliably counted on to turn a profit. And as noted, many of these cancellations led to layoffs and studios being closed, a problem worth talking about separately, because in 2025, these cuts and closings happened a lot.Â 2025 wasnât as bad for industry layoffs as 2024, but it was still pretty terrible. Nearly 10,000 developers lost jobs, according to layoff tracker Amir Satvat. Thatâs down from the over 15,000 pink-slips peak of 2025, but still up from 2022. The big cutbacks were once again at Microsoft, which shaved hundreds of jobs across its gaming division, including at Rare, Zenimax, and King.Â But those were hardly the only ones. Notable teams like Cloud Chamber, working on BioShock 4, lost dozens of staff, Amazon Gaming cut over 100 positions, and Square Enix made cuts across its international publishing business. Indies were also still hit hard. Heart Machine had to lay people off and end Hyper Light Breaker Early Access development early, while Wreckreation maker Three Fields Entertainment turned to Patreon as it looks for new funding.Â Randomly looking up the developer behind Floppy Knights to see what they were working on next, only to find a shutdown notice on their homepage, pretty much summed up the ongoing industry vibe.Â – Ethan Gach Generative AI isn’t new tech. It’s been floating around for a few years now. But in 2025, it felt like AI popped up more than ever across different games and studios. Swen Vincke, the head ofÂ Baldur’s Gate 3Â maker Larian Studios, stepped into it big time in December after he sounded shockingly bullish on AI generation tools. And Vincke wasn’t alone. Plenty of other video game executives and bosses had lots of positive things to say about AI generation tools. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II director Daniel VÃ¡vra is all for AI usage if it lets his studio make games faster. Chris Cocks, the CEO of D&D parent company Hasbro, said AI is “supercharging fandom.” Nexon CEO Junghun Lee, whose company owns the studio behind Arc Raiders, said in an interview that it’s “important to assume that every game company is now using AI,â and that other companies needed to rely on the tech to “increase [their] competitiveness.” Helldivers 2 boss Shams Jorjani thinks people are being too quick to dismiss AI and called Arc Raiders‘ use of the tech interesting, adding that in his view the tech “actually makes gaming better.â Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino reportedly said that it’s “becoming common sense in the creative world to rely on the power of AI to boost work efficiency.” Level-5 is the studio behind Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni.Â The gung-ho attitude so many gaming execs and bosses have toward gen AI tools likely explains how ugly, wonky AI slop keeps ending up in big video games, including Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,Â Anno 117: Pax Romana,Â and others. And despite players almost universally being against AI art and other slop, this trend isn’t going away in 2026. PUBG publisher Krafton plans to spend nearly $70 million on becoming an “AI-first” company. Ubisoft, meanwhile, is investing a lot into leveraging the controversial tech into its future video games, even showing off an FPS that was built entirely around AI tech. The shit has even worked its way into stuff like GZDoom and television show recaps. This is our future. It fucking sucks, and until the AI bubble pops, we all will have to put up with more slop in 2026, so greedy execs can make the line go up more by replacing devs and artists with AI chatbots and hoping gamers eventually get over it. It’s never been cheap to play video games. But in 2025, this already expensive hobby became even more pricey. As noted by Stephen Totilo over at Game File, since April, there have been eight price hikes total from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft on consoles, accessories, and subscriptions. This is likely one big reason why console sales were in the gutter in November. And even if you tried to buy a used Xbox or PS5 to save money, it would still likely be more expensive than that same console would have cost at launch in 2020. Meanwhile, Nintendo became the first publisher to break a shocking price barrier when it announced that Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World would be priced at $80. Later, Xbox announced that The Outer Worlds 2 would also be $80, but the backlash was so strong that it relented and lowered the price to $70. However, Xbox didn’t back down on raising prices on Game Pass and turned the service, once called the best deal in gaming by many, intoÂ a more complicated and expensive subscription service. Sony raised prices on PlayStation Plus as well. Perhaps you decide to skip consoles entirely, build a PC, and take advantage of all the great deals on stores like Steam and GOG. Well, thanks to a number of factors, including tech companies gobbling up parts for AI usage and President Trump’s idiotic tariffs, RAM and other PC parts are becoming more and more expensive. And this also means that PC handhelds, like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, will likely cost more when newer versions are announced, and prices on existing models will probably increase. Valve has also announced that it is done making the cheapest version of the Steam Deck, which isn’t good news for folks looking for an affordable and accessible entry into PC gaming. I mean, none of this is good news, and with rumors swirling that next-gen machines will be expensive behemoths, I’d recommend gamers start saving up money as we enter 2026. Itâs been five months since Steam and itch.io began purging certain NSFW games from their storefronts following pressure from payment processors like Mastercard. Despite an immediate backlash and ongoing calls not to let banks censor art, tons of games remain unavailable to purchase on the worldâs biggest PC gaming storefronts. The worst part of all is that itâs still not even clear who the corporate partners are trying to appease with the crackdown. The message to potential censorship advocates is that if you make enough noise, controversy-averse companies will back down. – Ethan Gach Electronic Arts is probably not anyoneâs favorite publisher, given itâs responsible for turning some beloved IPs into live-service slop and gutting certain teams under its umbrella after undermining them for decades, but nobody wants to see a company bought out by the Saudi government. Though EA claims it will maintain creative freedom after the $55 billion deal is signed, sealed, and delivered, all it takes is one person from on high to say that BioWare canât include queer relationships in Mass Effect 5 or that The Sims is now going to focus exclusively on the nuclear family for all of that independence to go away. EA can put on a brave face all it wants, but this is bleak, and a lot of good developers and stories are likely going to suffer for it.Â – Kenneth Shepard There was a lot of buzz around Mindseye, the first game from longtime Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies’ indie video game studio. It was going to be a GTA-like semi-open-world action game that tied into a larger suite of online game creation tools that people could use to build their own experiences, ala Roblox or Fortnite. Instead, what Mindseye ended up being when it launched earlier this year was a complete disaster. It was extremely buggy, ran like crap, was filled with boring missions, and felt sterile and empty. It was easily one of the worst games of the year, and it likely jeopardizes the future of Benzies’ studio and other projects. The Trump administration turning fascist propaganda into the stuff of memes isnât terribly surprising, but itâs disappointing that some of the biggest companies in video games just let him use their IP to do it. Microsoft and The PokÃ©mon Company both saw their creations used in posts from the Trump administration trying to recruit nerds to join ICE, and while The PokÃ©mon Company said it hadn’t given permission for the use of its work, it stopped short of condemning the video post of ICE agents âcatchingâ immigrants set to the iconic anime theme song from the â90s. Microsoft, meanwhile, didnât say a goddamn word. With the current administration being this brain-rotted and online, I imagine most people want to just keep their heads down and not put the spotlight on themselves for longer than they have to. But if Sabrina Carpenter can tell Trump to eat shit, so can you, Master Chief. – Kenneth Shepard 2024 was a bad year for physical media, and 2025 just brought more bad news on that front. Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game. They rely on the internet and Nintendo’s servers, and that should make everyone nervous. Meanwhile, I walked into a Target to do some Christmas shopping and discovered that my local store has just stopped selling Xbox games. The Outer Worlds 2 skipped a physical Xbox release entirely. And PlayStation made only 3 percent of its total profits in 2024 from physical game sales. Yikes. While physical games aren’t going away entirely in 2026, it does seem like the era of stores filled with aisles of games to buy is long gone. Grand Theft Auto 6, possibly the most highly anticipated video game release in a decade, suffered two more delays in 2025. Originally, Rockstar’s long-awaited open-world crime sim was supposed to launch this year, with many anticipating a fall arrival. But in the spring, the game was delayed until May 2026. Fans were given a second trailer to make up for the delay and marked the new date on their calendars. And then, about six months later, Rockstar announced another delay, pushing GTA 6 back all the way until November 2026. Of course, this wasn’t the most disappointing news to come from Rockstar Games in 2025. No, that would be the union-busting accusations leveled against the company after it fired over two dozen employees for allegedly sharing confidential information on Discord. The staff who were fired deny these allegations and, with the support of the Independent Workersâ Union of Great Britain, continued to protest at Rockstar’s offices. This whole situation has blown up so much that the UK’s Prime Minister has openly called out Rockstar Games and demanded further investigation. It’s clear this isn’t going away like Rockstar Games likely hoped, and when (if?) GTA 6 finally launches in 2026, the company’s firing of these employees will likely be a hot topic among the press and fans. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Timothée Chalamet, a Neil Diamond tribute band and more in theaters for Christmas
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5649826/marty-supreme-song-sung-blue-the-choral-the-plague
Time Published: 2025-12-24T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Bob Mondello , Stephen Thompson Timothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme. A24 hide caption A ping pong hustler for the ages, a Neil Diamond interpreter for the '80s, choral music both comic and spiritual, plus tormented teens, twisted families, and a giant snake on the loose. It's quite the jolly holiday at your local cineplex. They join a new Avatar sequel, a Bradley Cooper-directed drama, and more in theaters. In theaters Thursday I feel as if I should tell you to speed-read this review, preferably with Fats Domino's "The Fat Man" blaring in your ear. Josh Safdie's adrenaline-fueled, screwball comedy about a table tennis hustler who dreams of world domination — in a sport that hasn't registered yet with the American public — is a mesmerizing cinematic tour de force. Timothée Chalamet plays Marty Mauser (loosely based on real-life 1940s and '50s U.S. ping pong champ and petty criminal Marty Reisman), graduating from determined kid-with-a-passion to aggrieved also-ran-in-full-melt-down mode, attracting and then alienating everyone he comes across. We meet him as a New York shoe salesman having storeroom trysts with his married childhood sweetheart (Odessa A'zion) and prepping for a bout in England for which he can't even afford plane fare. Marty establishes with a series of heists and scams that he's got no problem cheating or stealing to get there, then regales the press with a pugnacious racist routine that lands him on front pages before his first serve. Chalamet's live-wire approach is neatly countered by a serenely sensual turn by Gwyneth Paltrow as an aging movie star who finds Marty amusing and alarming in about equal measure. And the film's just getting started at that point, careening towards a championship in Japan with the propulsive, harrowing, rush-to-judgment feel of Safdie's Uncut Gems mixed up with dizzying comedy. It's a thrill ride, pure and simple. — Bob Mondello In theaters Thursday Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life, blue-collar Milwaukee couple who formed a Neil Diamond tribute act in the 1980s, get the sequin-and-spangle treatment in this Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson love-fest. Writer and director Craig Brewer keeps the music central and the sentiment tolerable as the couple meets cute, bonds quick, and forms a musical act known professionally as Lightning and Thunder. The stars are well-matched and appealing — Hudson does a winning Patsy Cline impersonation, and Jackman completely nails Neil Diamond's sound and bearing. The couple's story, which has more downs than ups, doesn't quite match the mood of a movie determined to be ever-and-always-up. Still, the stars are engaging, the supporting cast great fun, and the music rousing. — Bob Mondello Whether you plan to head out to the theater or binge from the couch, our critics have gathered together their favorite films and TV shows of 2025. In theaters Thursday The original Anaconda movie came out almost 30 years ago, sending an assortment of '90s movie stars down the Amazon, where they were menaced and occasionally crushed and/or devoured by giant deadly snakes. That film, starring Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, was a hit that spawned a handful of lightly regarded sequels. Heavy on meta references to the original film, the new Anaconda is not quite a reboot, it's not quite a sequel, and it's played for laughs. Jack Black and Paul Rudd star as lifelong friends who grew up wanting to be filmmakers. But they've followed different career paths — Paul Rudd's character is a struggling actor whose biggest role was a bit part on the TV show S.W.A.T., while Jack Black's character makes wedding videos while yearning to shoot something more creative. They gather their old friends and collaborators — played by Thandiwe Newton and Steve Zahn — and head to the Amazon to shoot a meta reimagining of Anaconda. As you can imagine, this proves harder than it sounds. — Stephen Thompson In limited theaters Wednesday The first image is an eerie, underwater shot — sun-dappled blues, greens, and greys — its peace suddenly exploded as bodies plunge into the pool. Middle school boys, limbs all akimbo, almost literally at sea, as they struggle for equilibrium. It's an apt beginning for the story of a youngster trying to figure out where he fits in among the cliques at a summer water polo camp. Ben (Everett Blunck) is the camp newbie, Jake (Kayo Martin) its smirking cool kid who picks up on his fellow campers' idiosyncrasies and exploits them. He tells Ben that Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), a withdrawn boy with a rash, has the "plague" and must be avoided. Ben, seeing the obvious pain the outcast is in, can't square that with his own sense of decency, but also doesn't want to be ostracized, and his attempt to split the difference leads the film into Lord of the Flies territory. Charlie Polinger's directorial debut looks breathtaking, feels unnerving, and traffics cleverly in body-horror tropes as it basically establishes that 12-year-old boys are savages who should never be without adult supervision. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Wednesday You might expect Jim Jarmusch to look at family relationships with a certain eccentricity, but not necessarily in the elegantly framed way he does in this triptych about adult children and the parents they don't begin to understand. The Father segment casts Adam Driver and Mayim Bialik as siblings who are stiff with each other, and even less comfortable with their garrulous con man of a dad (Tom Waits). Driver's come with provisions and cash, Bialik's come armed with an arched eyebrow, and Waits is ready for them both. The second part, Mother, finds a sublimely chilly Charlotte Rampling hosting an awkward once-a-year tea for her daughters, one primly nervous (Cate Blanchett), the other pink-haired and boisterous (Vicky Krieps). And the final third, Sister Brother, finds Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat bonding in their recently deceased parents' now-empty Paris apartment. This segment seems less about estrangement, until you realize how little they actually know about their dear departed folks. There are running jokes about Rolexes, the expression "Bob's your uncle," and toasts to tie things together, along with a sweet, reflective tone that makes this one of the year's most compassionate films. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Director Nicholas Hytner and screenwriter Alan Bennett, who previously teamed up on The Madness of King George, The History Boys, and The Lady in the Van, are plumbing shallower depths in this gentle dramedy about an amateur chorus in 1916. When their choirmaster leaves to fight in World War I, grieving mill owner Roger Allam, who funds the chorus, reluctantly hires Dr. Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes), a gifted choirmaster but a divisive choice in this intensely nationalistic moment — because he's spent the last few years in Germany. He also exhibits "peculiarities" (code for being gay) but this seems less important to the locals. Fiennes is briskly dismissive of local traditions, snippy about English appreciation for the arts, and celebrated enough in music circles to persuade composer Edward Elgar (Simon Russell Beale) to let them perform his oratorio "The Dream of Gerontius." Elgar is less thrilled when he discovers the chorus is turning the oratorio into a story about the war, casting its elderly hero as a young soldier and generally making it what later generations would call "relevant." It's all sweet and sentimental, and though it's being released during awards seasons, feels as if it really wants to be considered for best picture of 1933. — Bob Mondello In select theaters Thursday "I've got it all," says paper factory supervisor Man-su as he hugs his family at a barbecue in the backyard of his elegant Korean home. He's grilling some eels given to him by the paper company's new American owners, secure in the knowledge that this must mean they value him. This being a social satire by director Park Chan-wook, it's reasonable to expect he will shortly be dealt a blow, and one day later, he's been axed. (The film is based on Donald E. Westlake's 1997 horror-thriller novel The Ax). He's distraught but can't express, or even really understand, that he feels he has lost his manhood, his mojo, and his reason for being. On top of that, his industry is consolidating, so finding another job before his severance pay runs out and he loses his house (his childhood home) will be tricky. Asked if he'd consider a job outside the paper industry, Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) says that for him there is "no other choice," echoing the words his American bosses uttered about bringing down costs as they did layoffs. But with the end of severance payments looming, he hatches a plan to knock off his job market competition one by one. Isn't this mass murder? Well, he has "no other choice." At first it seems as if we're in serial-killer comedy territory, but the filmmaker widens the frame to include narrative side trips — a stepson who's stealing cellphones, a daughter who's a cello prodigy, a wife who's working for a dentist that Man-su suspects has designs on her. Oh, and pig-farm trauma from his youth, and a passion for greenhouse gardening. Director Park has a lot going on, and a final paper-plant-mechanization sequence suggests that all these stabs at human agency may just have been humanity's last gasp. — Bob Mondello In limited theaters Thursday Ambitious, stylized, intense, and thoroughly unorthodox, Mona Fastvold's religious biopic tells the story of Shakers founder Ann Lee (a wild-eyed, fiercely committed Amanda Seyfried) as a full-scale musical drama. That's not to say there are finger-snapping tunes. The score adapts 18th century Shaker spirituals, and the choreography involves the thrusting limbs and clawing fingers of the seizure-like dancing that earned this puritan sect of "Shaking" Quakers their nickname. We meet Ann as a pious youngster more interested in spiritual matters than matters of the flesh. Marriage to a man who enjoys inflicting pain during sex, and the deaths of her four children in infancy lead Ann to the conclusion that lifelong celibacy is among the keys to salvation. With the help of her younger brother (Lewis Pullman), she finds adherents to a religious philosophy that also emphasizes gender equality and simple living, and leads them to found a utopian, crafts-based community in America. Director Fastvold and her co-writer Brady Corbet (the couple flipped roles from last year's The Brutalist) serve up Ann's spiritual journey in ecstatically musical terms, which is at once distancing and … well, ecstatic, though it pales a bit over the course of two-and-a-quarter hours. — Bob Mondello Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: AI Gets the Blame for 55,000 Layoffs in 2025

Reading time 2 minutes Companies cut about 1.1 million jobs this year, the most since the covid-19 pandemic. However, the notion that those layoffs are occurring due to technological advancements, as if the majority of those roles are now filled by artificial intelligence, doesn’t quite align with the data. According to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, about 55,000 layoffs were attributed directly to AIâless than 1% of all job losses. One industry where layoffs were common this year was tech, with many of the Big Tech firms cutting off large chunks of their workforce. Those often came with platitudes about streamlining and modernizing roles, with vague gestures toward the idea that AI will be stepping in. As Amazon started preparing to lay off workers in June, CEO Andy Jassy told employees that AI would mean the company would âneed fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” But in October, after cutting 14,000 people loose, Jassy told investors the decision was “not even really AI driven, not right now at least.” That’s not to say the introduction of AI hasn’t truly cost people jobs. Corporations like Salesforce, for instance, have gleefully sent humans home and started to make claims that as much as 50% of all work is now completed by AI. But if AI has had an effect on the workforce, it seems like it isn’t directly causing layoffs but is instead blocking new hires. Not only are people losing work, but companies also aren’t hiringâand entry-level roles in particular have been hard hit by the misguided idea that their roles can be filled by AI. Meanwhile, an MIT study published this summer found that 95% of organizations that have launched AI initiatives have seen zero financial return on their investment. The layoffs that have hit workers are real, of course. But AI may simply be a useful scapegoat for companies that want to appear like they are embracing automation and being forward-thinking when the reality is they either overhired in recent years while the economy was booming and now want to cut back as profit margins get thinner, or have been extremely hard hit by a turbulent economy plagued by the Trump administration’s tariff regime. The manufacturing industry, which should be booming with the massive data center construction projects cropping up across the country, has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since the start of the year. It’s not AI taking those roles. In the same Challenger, Gray and Christmas report that shows 55,000 jobs were lost directly to AI, more than twice as many were attributed to restructuring, about four times as many were blamed on market and economic conditions, and nearly six times as many were chalked up to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and the downstream impact of those decisions. It’s a good reminder that even when AI is attributed as the reason for a job cut, the decision was made by an executive who has done the math and determined that axing human labor in the name of “modernization” will likely boost the stock price.

Title: Microsoft bets on cloud and cross-platform future for Xbox while brushing off 30% profit margin rumors

Microsoft has denied recent reports claiming that it imposed a strict 30% profit margin on its Xbox gaming division. The company said it aims high, but didn’t provide an exact profit margin figure. Microsoft pushed back against the claims in a new CNBC interview, where the company discussed the challenges and rumors that arose over the past year, including numerous layoffs and project cancellations. Previously, a Bloomberg story in October reported that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has set a 30% profit goal as part of “accountability margins,” with Xbox in particular feeling the pressure. Many industry insiders whispered similar information, which was acknowledged as the primary driver of Microsoft’s cost-cutting measures, including scrapping various projects and reducing headcount. The 30% figure stood out because it’s well above typical profit margins in the gaming industry, which are reported to range from 17% to 22%. Xbox’s own margins were 12% in 2022, according to earlier documentation. Microsoft spoke to CNBC directly and said, “While the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.” Xbox’s hurdles have been piling up, with over 9,000 employees affected across multiple rounds of layoffs. Numerous big-budget projects were axed in the wake of Microsoft’s layoffs, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark Reboot, Rare’s long-in-development Everwild, and ZeniMax Online’s sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird. Furthermore, Xbox sales have taken a nosedive, with a whopping 70% drop in November, putting the company far behind Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s Switch 2 in hardware sales. Xbox also announced last week that it wouldn’t be implementing the Xbox Wrapped feature this year due to budget constraints. Reports claim that Xbox is shifting funds toward its 25th anniversary celebration in 2026. However, it still shows that the company is under financial pressure. Despite all these challenges and setbacks, Microsoft is still pursuing and pivoting towards cloud gaming and cross-platform gaming, Xbox Game Pass subscription, and is forgoing exclusivity to allow more players to join Xbox’s gaming endeavors, ranging from PCs, handhelds like the Rog Ally and Ally X, mobile devices, and even automobiles. As for Bloomberg, it’s not yet clear if the news outlet will retract its statement, update its report, or provide further information regarding the matter. Buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on Amazon CNBC

Title: The 120 Most Powerful Executives in Entertainment, Ranked

Time Published: 2025-12-23T18:00:00Z

In business, the power of individual leaders is an inherently hard thing to measure. It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions. To commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood. After months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment. Notice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming. We intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news. When you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line. Also, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion. We also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options. Variety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here. Listen to “Daily Variety” podcast: Showbiz news and analysis tailored for industry insiders. Spoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs. We noticed that from our internet traffic and by the growing number of markets and festivals that we cover in the region. We made this choice to bookend the list with a signpost of the future and an example of the reach and influence of movies, TV, music and games. From our very first issue, published Dec. 16, 1905, much of Variety’s focus has been on the people who work behind the scenes to make things happen for those who take the stage. We hope this list can be a scorecard for readers who, like the staff of Variety, are eager to see what comes next for our fascinating industry in 2026 and beyond. Profiles written by Jem Aswad, Matt Donnelly, Steven J. Horowitz, Angelique Jackson, Elsa Keslassy, Brent Lang, Cynthia Littleton, Jennifer Maas, Naman Ramachandran, Rebecca Rubin, Michael Schneider, Todd Spangler, Brian Steinberg and Nick Vivarelli. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Sarandos got his start in the entertainment biz working at a video-rental store as a teen. He’s now one of the most powerful content executives in Hollywood, rubbing elbows with celebs, showrunners, directors and other creatives who make content (or want to) for Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers worldwide. He’s overseen all content operations at the company since 2000, when it was still a DVD-by-mail outfit, and has had his hand on the steering wheel throughout its monumental rise. Sarandos led Netflix’s move into original content starting with the 2013 launch of “House of Cards.” He has famously called the moviegoing experience “outdated,” irking not just theater owners but filmmakers. In a reflection of Netflix’s clout, Sarandos has made a serious bid to acquire the Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Even if Netflix doesn’t win, Sarandos is showing that the company is definitely playing in the big leagues. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The more that Comcast pushes onto Langley’s plate, the more she rises to the challenge. As NBCUniversal and other top traditional media companies focus on the power of big events to draw large audiences, Langley must translate her success with content franchises into devising spectacles that bring people to screens all at the same time. Look for NBCU to celebrate more anniversaries like the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s centennial in the months to come. She must also help stock the pipeline with new content favorites that draw viewers to the Peacock streaming service as well as traditional TV. After a sweeping reorganization of NBCUniversal in 2024, Langley controls greenlights across the entire enterprise, overseeing programming, marketing, distribution, acquisitions and operations for the film and TV studios, the linear network, Peacock and Bravo. Her trademark poise served her well through the M&A noise of 2025, delivering consistent support for creatives. Langley’s beloved film studio Universal Pictures, her training ground, look to blow the doors off of 2026 with releases from Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg, as well as animated sequels in the “Minions” and “Super Mario Bros.” franchises. Title: Chairman and CEO, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ellison has a network of influential friends and family, starting with his ultra-wealthy dad, Oracle mogul Larry Ellison. After a career as a film producer with hits that included Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” Ellison donned the mantle of media mogul. He led Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, bankrolled by his father and RedBird Capital Partners — a deal that met with the approval of Donald Trump and his administration. After installing a mostly new management team, Ellison’s early moves at the new Paramount Skydance have included inking a rich deal for UFC rights and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’s The Free Press (with Weiss installed as editor-in-chief of CBS News). Ellison is now looking consolidate more power in Hollywood: He’s in the thick of a public brawl with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, pitting him against Netflix. The sale process is turning in to a referendum on the future of Hollywood. Title: CEO, YouTube Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Mohan is a Silicon Valley exec with a chill vibe — who runs a media business estimated to rival Disney by revenue, as YouTube reinforces its pole position as the most-streamed service on TVs in the U.S. That stunning stat surely helped YouTube land the TV rights deal that shocked Hollywood: The annual Oscars kudocast will move to YouTube starting in 2029 with the 101st Academy Awards ceremony. It’s been a busy few years on the job for Mohan, who assumed the chief exec role in 2023 after serving as YouTube’s chief product officer. He joined Google with its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007. In addition to overseeing YouTube’s significant core ads business, Mohan has been driving growth of the platform’s subscriptions businesses, including YouTube TV. With more than 10 million pay-TV subscribers, YouTube was in a position to flex its market power in programming renewals in 2025 — and its tough negotiating tactics led to blackouts of Disney and Univision nets before the parties reached deals. Mohan is now setting YouTube’s AI agenda, balancing concerns of Hollywood players with the rollout of powerful new content tools for its millions of creators. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: One of the most powerful and well-regarded execs in TV, Walden leads Disney’s portfolio of entertainment media, news and content businesses worldwide, and has shared oversight of Disney+ and Hulu with Alan Bergman. Under her leadership, ABC has been the No. 1 entertainment network for four straight seasons and ABC News has topped its rivals — impressive achievements even as linear TV continues to decline. Over the years, Walden has had indisputable success in television, overseeing such hits as “24,” “Glee,” “Modern Family,” “Homeland,” “This Is Us” and more recently, “Abbott Elementary,” “High Potential,” “Paradise,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Kardashians” and more. Before joining Disney, she rose through the ranks at the Fox studio and network. Now she’s on the short list to succeed Bob Iger at the helm of Disney next year. This fall, Walden faced a test with ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel amid a right-wing backlash over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s murder. After a PR storm, she brought Kimmel back and got two big affiliate groups to resume airing his show. She was also in the thick of Disney’s two-week battle with YouTube in November over a carriage agreement. Title: CEO, Disney Held job since: 2022 (was CEO from 2005-20) Sources of power: Iger is on his second farewell tour as leader of the Magic Kingdom, with the 74-year-old executive’s contract expiring in December 2026 — and Disney’s board poised to name a successor early next year. But even as a lame-duck CEO, Iger remains a powerful force in media and entertainment. Following Iger’s return as chief exec in late 2022 in the wake of Disney’s first try at finding an Iger successor did not take. Since his return, Iger has reinvigorated Disney’s movie studios and overseen the theme park and cruise biz’s recovery from the COVID crash. Iger has moved to combine Disney+ and Hulu (after closing the buyout of Comcast’s Hulu stake) into a supercharged unified streamer while finally launching a streaming-only version of ESPN. The stock hasn’t recovered from its streaming-bubble highs, but Iger has proven a deft manager of the global entertainment conglomerate’s many moving pieces. Even as he says goodbye — after postponing his retirement five times! — Iger will have a part in the selection of the next CEO. Title: Chairman and CEO, Comcast Corp. Held job since: Chairman, 2004; CEO, 2002 Sources of power: An unassuming media executive in an industry filled with CEOs willing to pitch, promote and propagandize, Roberts presides over one of the largest distributorships of video in the nation, as well as the NBCUniversal entertainment empire. He has quietly worked to keep the company current by investing in sports rights as well as overseas assets like Sky. Roberts must now steer the company around new hurdles, including cord cutting and the rise of streaming video. Because nothing stays the same in pay TV for long. With the planned Versant Media spinoff expected to be completed early next year, Comcast will soon part with the basic cable networks that were so central to its purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric back in 2011. Title: Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group Held job since: 2010 Sources of power: Grainge joined Universal in 1986 at leader of its Polydor publishing division and rose through the ranks during periods of galvanizing change in the industry, assuming the helm in 2010 just as streaming was beginning to take hold. In the years since he has presided over UMG’s expansion into the world’s largest music company — with artists ranging from the Beatles and Taylor Swift to the Weeknd and “KPop Demon Hunters” — its public listing in 2021, the expansion of its publishing and merchandise divisions, and the rise and plateau of streaming growth. Most recently, UMG has taken a leadership position in steering the industry through the challenges of AI (striking deals with and/or lawsuits against major AI companies — or both, as with Suno) and its next areas of growth, including initiatives to increasingly monetize “superfans.” There are certainly challenges: UMG’s $775 million acquisition of the artist-services company Downtown is under fierce scrutiny from the EU, and it was actually sued for defamation by Drake, one of its biggest artists, in bizarre collateral damage from that artist’s feud with fellow UMG artist Kendrick Lamar. But in the third quarter of 2025, Universal held nearly 36% U.S. market share — and that was before the release of Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl,” which sold a record-breaking 2.7 million copies on its first day. Title: CEO, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: David Zaslav has been on a hire-wire act of debt, restructuring and outrunning the marketplace to prove the merger thesis that brought WarnerMedia and Discovery together in April 2022. But time ran out. David Ellison’s aggressive overtures forced his hand to initiate a sale process for all or part of the Warner Bros. Discovery (depending on who’s buying). For the foreseeable future, Zaslav still holds the keys in Burbank and Hudson Yards – and he’s demonstrating that in rebuffing Paramount’s offers more than half a dozen times in favor of Netflix’s $83 billion offer. Leading WBD for the past three years has been Zaslav’s highest profile job in Hollywood – and he’s become a lightning rod in the creative community at a time of disruption. Zaslav got his start in the go-go early days of cable in the 1980s with a long tenure at NBC where he helped launch CNBC and MSNBC. He gained prominence as a CEO – and for his huge paychecks — after he took the reins of Discovery Communications in late 2006. Title: Senior VP of Services, Apple Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: Cue is the ultimate Apple insider. He has long steered its expansion on the software and services side of the ledger for the company that has transformed the world with its hardware. He also clearly has the trust of CEO Tim Cook to set the agenda for Apple in Hollywood. Cue has embraced a build-not-buy strategy as Apple has revved up the Apple TV content business with big-budget series, sports rights, documentaries and children’s programs. The success of Apple’s first mega-budget film production, “F1: The Movie,” reflected well on Cue’s steady-hand stewardship. And his ambition was on display when he told Variety during a cover story interview that he really wanted “F1” to reach moviegoers in a profound way. “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” he told Variety in April 2025. Title: Chief Content Officer, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Nearly three years into her gig as chief content officer at Netflix and with almost a decade at the streamer under her belt, Bajaria oversees some of the biggest and boldest TV shows of our time, including “Stranger Things,” “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” “Bridgerton,” “Heeramandi” and “Lupin,” and Oscar-winning films like “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.” And her power in Hollywood is poised to get even bigger if Netflix succeeds in taking over Warner Bros. Discovery. For now, Bajaria’s focus is on continuing to grow Netflix’s local-programming offerings throughout the globe and pushing the streamer further into live events and sports. Before joining Netflix, Bela was president of Universal Television. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Bergman is the well-respected leader in charge of the Mouse House’s film studios, which feed into both theatrical and streaming pipelines. He’s managing not just release windows and production budgets, but also egos. On his watch, Disney has produced several billion-dollar-plus hits, including “Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Moana 2” and the live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” with “Zootopia 2” on track to be another big winner. A nearly three-decade company veteran, he became chairman of Walt Disney Studios in 2021. He was elevated to his current role in 2023, in which capacity he has shared oversight (alongside Dana Walden) of Disney’s direct-to-consumer, technology and ad sales groups, as well as international content and operations. Title: Head of Amazon MGM Studios and Amazon Prime Video Held job since: 2020 Sources of power: Mike Hopkins shepherded some big changes at Amazon’s on-screen entertainment division this year with the exits of both Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders from the studio business, and the entrance of longtime Netflix TV exec Peter Friedlander. Building on his background in distribution and sales from his time as CEO at Hulu and president of Fox networks, Hopkins continues to push Amazon into TV ad sales through its Amazon Ads infrastructure to growing success. Under Hopkins, Prime Video currently offers more than 100 add-on subscription options in the U.S., including Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max, Paramount+, Sony’s Crunchyroll and Amazon-owned MGM+. Amazon’s reach has made the channels offering a big driver of subscription for these media partners. Title: President and CEO, Live Nation Held job since: 2005 Sources of power: A master of vertical integration, Rapino has kept Live Nation and Ticketmaster to one record-breaking year after another even as the post-pandemic boom in concertgoing has leveled off. So far in 2025, Live Nation is on pace to have its biggest year yet, with overall revenue for the first nine months hitting $18.89 billion, up eight percent compared to last year’s $17.5 billion. Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to the demand for live entertainment in international markets, where fan count is projected to surpass the United States for the first time. Chalk that up to major tours that saw artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé traipsing the globe, yet it’s also the company’s ongoing ventures into management, venue ownership and other related areas of the business. Title: Chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content Held job since: August 2020 Sources of power: Casey Bloys likes awards, and for good reason: HBO/HBO Max gets a lot of them. In 2025, the combined outlets landed 30 Emmys — tying Netflix for the most — thanks to the strength of series like “The Pitt” (outstanding drama series), “The Penguin,” “Hacks,” “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and more. His current roster also includes smashes like “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria” — which recently gave him four current original series with cross-platform audiences averaging more than 15 million viewers per episode – a first for the pay cabler. Other titles that have driven the TV conversation under his watch have included “Succession,” “Barry,” “The Rehearsal,” the “True Detective” franchise, “And Just Like That” and “Peacemaker”; and earlier, “Veep,” “Girls,” “Silicon Valley,” “Watchmen,” “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies” and “Chernobyl.” Bloys first took over HBO series, late night and specials as president in February 2016; he joined the network in 2004 as director of development at HBO Independent Productions. Title: Chairman, FX Networks Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: An astute observer of the TV landscape and respected creative leader, Landgraf has made boundary-pushing television a hallmark of FX ever since he joined in 2004. Under Landgraf, FX has produced solid ratings and acclaim with bold (some might say risky) bets such as “Shōgun” — winner of 18 Emmy awards, a one-year record for a single series — as well as series like “The Bear,” “Fargo,” “Alien: Earth,” long-running fan-favorite “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise. After Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Landgraf aligned with the Mouse House’s streaming strategy to make Hulu the primary streaming outlet for FX, which has let him continue to take big swings on standout content. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Peters may not have the name recognition of his co-CEO partner Ted Sarandos, but the duo are on equal footing in running the streaming giant. Peters, who joined Netflix in 2008, was previously chief product officer and spent several years as general manager of Netflix Japan. While Sarandos handles the content side, Peters focuses on technology, product development, pricing and partnerships. His purview also includes the still-nascent games initiative and the growing ad-supported business. Peters knows the Netflix culture inside and out, and he’s credited with building the company’s talent organization and recently overseeing a revision to its famed “Culture Memo.” Peters will be an integral part of any integration of Warner Bros. and HBO into Netflix, should the acquisition agreement come to pass. Title: President, Marvel Studios; Chief Creative Officer, Marvel Held job since: 2010 / 2019 Sources of power: After a stretch of ho-hum box office performers in recent years, Marvel Studios aims to reclaim its status as the premiere superhero studio in 2026 with “Avengers: Doomsday.” The blockbuster-to-be features the return of “Endgame” directors Anthony and Joe Russo, the revival of Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, and recasting Robert Downey Jr. as the villainous Doctor Doom, plus finally introducing the X-Men into the MCU. In a rare interview with reporters over the summer, Feige declared that well-documented problems Marvel’s been facing stem from an overabundance of supply, not a sudden drop in demand. As such, Marvel’s output for 2026 will be drastically decreased, with just three movies launching in theaters: “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” the studio’s co-production with Sony Pictures; a special re-release of “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doomsday.” Title: President and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ravi Ahuja was one half of the most orderly transition atop a Hollywood studio in recent memory. He took the CEO reins from Tony Vinciquerra last January, but the plan was set in motion when Ahuja was recruited to Sony to head TV operations, after a he had a brief run as president of business operations and chief financial officer of Walt Disney Television. Ahuja’s first big test at Sony was steering the “Jeopardy” host transition, which took two tries to get right, but America’s favorite quiz show endured. Now he’s got a long runway to lead the studio into its second century (Columbia Pictures marked its centennial in 2024) and its endowed with a library of more than 3,500 films and more than 35,000 episodes in an IP-hungry marketplace. Title: President, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: • He’s the key operating executive overseeing the newly merged Paramount Skydance.• He’s a media veteran after climbing the ranks at NBCUniversal, Comcast and Fox. Shell has rebounded at the enlarged Paramount Skydance after exiting NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to having had an inappropriate relationship with an NBCUniversal employee. He’s now back in new role as David Ellison’s right-hand man given his depth of experience. At Paramount Skydance, he’s overseeing day-to-day operations, a task that has included a wave of mass layoffs conducted three months after the Paramount Global takeover closed. Shell isn’t just trying to slash costs: He and Ellison envision a new path forward for Paramount’s TV business, hoping to reinvent brands like CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central for a streaming-centric world, while pumping more content into Paramount+. If his boss is successful in landing Warner Bros. Discovery, Shell will have an even bigger collection of media businesses under his oversight. Title: Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corp., Chairman of News Corp. Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Under Murdoch’s aegis, Fox Corp. proven surprisingly robust and resilient. After the company sold off much of its studio and cable assets to Disney in 2019, conventional wisdom held that Fox would be a small but feisty element in the media ecosystem, but the company’s focus on news, sports and other types of must-watch-as-it-happens content has boosted viewership and revenue. There are challenges ahead, especially as the NFL moves closer to renegotiating its current media contracts, but Fox has thrived by taking measured steps into streaming and bigger steps to lock in live viewership. Title: President and CEO, Sony Group Corporation Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Hiroki Totoki took over as Sony’s CEO in April 2025 as the company’s center of gravity shifted decisively toward entertainment. In the run-up to the transition, he was closely involved in steering Sony’s entertainment businesses toward greater IP coordination across Pictures, Music and PlayStation, reinforcing a strategy built on franchises that can move across formats and markets. That approach aligns with Sony’s long-standing focus on Kando — emotional impact delivered at scale — and has shown up in properties ranging from anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer” to cross-media adaptations like “The Last of Us.” Totoki also took direct oversight of Sony Interactive Entertainment during a leadership transition, underlining his role as the executive trusted with execution when the stakes are high. As CEO, he now controls a company where games, music, film and anime drive strategy — alongside the hardware that carries them. Title: Co-Chair and CEO, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca proved naysayers wrong this year after a rough 2024 and early 2025. They turned things around the old-fashioned way – by banking on bold directors and new ideas during a time where reboots and sequels have reigned supreme. Movies of all shapes and sizes, from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Zach Cregger’s “Weapons” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” scored with audiences. It’s an ethos that De Luca has embraced throughout his career, which took off when he was named production chief at New Line Cinema at the age of 27. He championed films such as “Seven,” “Boogie Nights,” “Friday” and helped to launch the careers of David Fincher and Anderson. The pair headed MGM prior to its sale to Amazon, which was around the time that Warner Bros. was in the market for new film leadership. Abdy and De Luca got to work quickly and took big swings while brokering deals with directors and stars like Ryan Coogler, Emerald Fennell, Zach Cregger and Tom Cruise. The 2025 slate backs up the pair’s promise to use WB’s considerable resources to make the studio an attractive place to work for “filmmakers with singular visions,” as they wrote in a memo to staff in October after renewing their contracts. Title: Chairman and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Rothman is the definition of a certain kind of hard-driving studio executive of yore but this year he proved he can innovate with original concepts and service big IP at the same time. He bet on Keke Palmer, SZA and Issa Rae with the commercial and critical hit “One of Them Days,” relaunched Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” franchise with a sequel to follow immediately in ’26 and captured the zeitgeist with “KPop Demon Hunters” (though that film released via Sony’s pay-one partner Netflix). As always with Rothman, the man guaranteed to deliver an expletive-laden sound bite at CinemaCon, it’s about next year’s slate. 2026 will bring “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” and the innovative four-part biopic release “The Beatles” from filmmaker Sam Mendes. Title: Chairman, Netflix Film Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: After building a reputation on spinning popular film franchises out of existing IP (“The Lego Movie” franchise, Stephen King’s “It” and “Sherlock Holmes”), in 2024, film producer Dan Lin pivoted from film producer to studio head by taking on the top film job at Netflix. Just two years prior, Lin had been in negotiations to become head of DC Studios but decided to stick to his own shingle, Rideback, but the Netflix offer proved to be the right kind of challenge. Since joining the streamer, Lin has enforced a strategy of making one major tentpole film each quarter — upcoming offerings include “The Rip,” from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; “Apex” with Charlize Theron; and “Here Comes the Flood,” with Denzel Washingont, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Robert Pattionson. Among Lin’s biggest wins so far was overseeing the final cut of “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” which has become Netflix’s biggest film ever and greenlighting an ambitious slate of films, including Greta Gerwig’s “Narnia,” which will also play an exclusive engagement at Imax theaters worldwide. Titles: Co-Head, Worldwide Video, Apple Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Erlicht and Van Amburg long ago learned how to expand their effectiveness through an air-tight partnership. They worked together for 15 years as programming executives at Sony Pictures Television and its predecessors before being recruited in 2017 by Apple services boss Eddy Cue to drive the company’s leap into original content production and commissioning what was born in November 2019 as Apple TV+ (in October, they nixed the + sign with a rebrand as Apple TV). The two have built the operation in the fishbowl of being a high-profile startup effort within a corporate giant of immense influence and a $4 trillion market cap. Erlicht and Van Amburg have endured waves of rumored shakeups and scrutiny of their creative strategies. This summer “F1: The Movie” was the kind of popcorn vehicle at the global box office that made the parent company proud. It also dovetailed nicely with Apple TV’s five-year deal unveiled in October that will bring F1 racing rights to its platform in the U.S. starting in 2026. Title: Co-Chair, Paramount Pictures and Chair, Paramount Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Dana Goldberg has a bigger picture to look at these days now that her longtime home Skydance is also home to all of Paramount’s IP. Partnered with Josh Greenstein on the film front and flying solo at the top of TV, Goldberg is plotting out long-term strategy for both divisions under David Ellison’s new regime. As of this year, Goldberg now oversees production, marketing, distribution and strategic planning, and has added Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Television Studios to her purview. Goldberg joined Skydance in 2010 as president of production and helped found Skydance Television in 2013. Most recently, Goldberg was chief creative officer of Skydance overseeing several entries in the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise, as well as hit series like “Reacher” and “Jack Ryan.” Before joining Skydance, Goldberg was head of production at Village Roadshow Pictures. Title: Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of Platforms, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: This year, Josh Greenstein left Sony Pictures after a decade to head up the film division at the newly merged Skydance-Paramount alongside Dana Goldberg, and advise on Paramount’s new cross-platform strategy across film and TV. For the previous 10 years, Greenstein was at the top of Sony’s Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films, AFFIRM Films, and Sony Pictures Animation, overseeing films including the “Spider-Man” and “Spiderverse” franchises, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “James Bond” and Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” During Greenstein’s tenure, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time, earning $1.91 billion worldwide at the box office and “Into the Spider-Verse” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Prior to joining Sony, he was head of marketing at Paramount Pictures, overseeing franchises including “Transformers,” “Star Trek,” “Jackass” and “Scary Movie.” Title: Co-chairman and CEO, DC Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: James Gunn and Peter Safran, the new guardians of DC Studios, were hired to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for the Warner Bros.-owned comic book empire. Gunn, the operation’s creative mind, took those efforts into his own hands with last summer’s hit “Superman,” which had epic responsibility of relaunching DC Universe. (The studio’s last iteration of superhero movies imploded with the unfortunate losing-streak of “The Flash,” “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “Blue Beetle.”) Gunn will return to the director’s chair for what he describes as the “next installment in the Super-Family,” but he’s passed off the reins for “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” two spinoffs set in 2026 that’ll be a bigger test of DC’s popularity. Both focus on comic book characters that don’t enjoy the benefit of being household names. Safran, a business-minded executive and a former talent manager with Brillstein-Grey, has proven a flair for knowing the projects that’ll speak to audiences. He’s a lead producer on the “Conjuring” universe, which is the highest-grossing horror franchise with more than $2 billion across nine films. Title: CEO, Lionsgate Held job since: 2000 Sources of power: Lionsgate was a much smaller operation when Feltheimer took over the the turn of the 2000s after nine years at Sony’s Columbia TriStar TV Group. The Canadian-born studio emerged as a global contender on Feltheimer’s watch with hits such as the “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games” film series. The studio rode the pre-Peak TV wave of scripted expansion with such distinctive hits as “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and more recently “Ghosts,” “Yellowjackets” and “The Studio.” But like every other studio, Lionsgate’s traditional profit engines are under new pressures that will challenge the leadership of a long-serving CEO. Title: CEO, Sony Music Entertainment/Chairman, Sony Music Group Held job since: 2017/2019 Sources of power: Stringer has spent his tenure at Sony Music building out the various arms of the operation, from buying indie companies AWAL and Orchard to acquiring catalogs from Queen and Pink Floyd, for a reported $1.27 billion and $400 million, respectively. This year, Sony Music Entertainment saw significant boosts across the board as records including Tyler, the Creator’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” and Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR Más FOToS” became global hits, boosting total profit from recorded music and publishing to $2.89 billion in Q3 — up 13.3 percent year over year. Over the first three quarters of 2025, SME earned a 26.65 percent market share, per Billboard — ahead of Warner Music Group and indies, and only second to Universal Music Group. And in an industry where AI has become a hotbed for controversy, Stringer has helped broker a landmark deal with Spotify to develop AI tools intended to aid artists. Title: Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Pearlena Igbokwe has arguably one of the most compelling stories of any TV executive out there: Having emigrated from Nigeria at age 6, Igbokwe was raised on some the greatest U.S. shows of the 1970s and 1980s. That inspired her to pursue a job in TV, which led her to early positions at NBC and HBO, before starting a 20-year tenure at Showtime, where she developed “Dexter,” “Nurse Jackie” and “Masters of Sex,” among other shows. In 2012, she returned to NBC, and quickly saw her star rise as she worked in drama on series such as “The Blacklist” and “This Is Us.” Moving to Universal TV as president, she expanded the Dick Wolf empire (which now includes the “Law & Order,” “Chicago” and “FBI” franchises) and built a thriving business as a supplier to outlets like Netflix and HBO. Taking over Universal Studio Group in 2020, Igbokwe now oversees teams that handle staples like NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “America’s Got Talent” as well as HBO Max’s “Hacks,” Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside” and all those Wolf shows. And the talent in her company’s purview include Mike Schur, Tina Fey, Jordan Peele, Darren Star, Nahnatchka Khan, Seth MacFarlane, Julie Plec, Amy Poehler, Lorne Michaels and others. Title: Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and US Networks Held job since: 2021 / 2025 Sources of power: Channing Dungey has made history several times in her career, including as the first Black executive to lead a major broadcast network, and the first woman and first Black executive to run Warner Bros. TV Group. Her oversight include Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted TV (including Warner Horizon, Shed Media and Telepictures) and animated producers Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. On her watch, Warner Bros. TV Group has enjoyed a string of recent successes in network, cable, streaming and syndication including “The Pitt,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Ted Lasso,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Penguin,” “Shrinking,” “The Voice,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage,” “Running Point,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “You” and more. Before Warner Bros. and Discovery plan their split — which would move the U.S. networks to a separate company — Dungey has also spent part of the past year evolving the conglom’s linear TV business with channels like Discovery, HGTV, Food, Cartoon Network, TLC, Adult Swim, TBS, TNT, TCM and others. Dungey is a well-liked, celebrated exec who at ABC Entertainment built hits like “The Good Doctor” and the return of “American Idol,” and also made a swift change to “Roseanne” when its star made offensive remarks on social media. She also developed signature shows like “Scandal” and “Once Upon a Time” and helped keep long-running series like “Grey’s Anatomy” as juggernauts. She was also named one of Variety’s Power of Women honorees in 2021. Title: President of Direct-to-Consumer, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Joe Earley has the marketing sensibilities required to oversee the operations and growth strategies for two of the most important assets of the future for Disney – streamers Disney+ and Hulu. His experience as a producer with Gail Berman at Jackal Group after he left Fox will also serve him well in a job that requires juggling a broad portfolio – from Hulu’s edgy limited series to Disney-branded shows for Disney+. Title: Chair of Direct to Consumer, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: While now a key member of David Ellison’s leadership team at the Skydance-owned Paramount, Cindy Holland is still best known for setting Netflix up to be the powerhouse TV industry player it is today. Holland spent a total of 18 years with the streamer, nine of which she served as head of original content, where she established the programming strategy with early streaming hits including “House of Cards,” “Orange is the New Black” and “Stranger Things.” Earlier this year, Holland stepped away from her role as CEO at indie studio Sister to join Ellison’s exec ranks as the lieutenant in charge of revamping Paramount’s streaming offering as the company enters its new era. Title: CEO, Illumination Entertainment Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Chris Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007 after a stint running animation at Fox. He quickly established the company, which was backed by Universal, as one of the most successful producers of family fare in Hollywood. It all kicked off with 2010’s “Despicable Me,” the story of a reformed supervillain named Gru that has spawned four films and three spinoffs featuring the Minions. But Illumination didn’t stop there, producing hits such as “The Grinch,” “Sing” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” What makes the company’s output particularly appealing is that its movies cost between $70 million to $100 million to produce, far less than the $200 million that Disney typically spends. Next up, Illumination will release “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” and “Minions 3,” both of which are expected to be among 2026’s biggest box office players. Title: President, Disney Television Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Erwich oversees a broad menu of programs and brands in his role leading ABC Entertainment, Hulu Originals, Freeform, Disney Channel and other kidvid platforms. He’s worked as a program buyer and seller, giving him the perspective and connections to juggle a high volume of development and production. Erwich has been key to Disney’s strategy of windowing “Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise” and other Hulu originals on ABC. “There’s the broadcast experience and the kind of shows that thrive there, but now there’s another window — and a very important and vibrant one for those shows — on Hulu,” Erwich told Variety in April. Title: Chair of TV Media, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: George Cheeks is one of the few Paramount Global senior employees who came out of the Skydance acquisition with a prime spot at the top under David Ellison. Following a brief tenure as co-CEO of Paramount Global upon the exit of Bob Bakish, while also still acting as president and CEO of CBS. Now, Cheeks’ brands include CBS Television Network, CBS News and Stations, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, BET Studios, Nickelodeon TV Studios, See It Now Studios, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET. Since Cheeks took over at CBS, the network, has launched hits including “Tracker,” “Fire Country,” “Ghosts” and “Matlock.” Cheeks came over to CBS in 2020 after a stint as co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. Title: Head of Theatrical and Streaming Films, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: The longtime Warner Bros. Pictures executive came to Amazon MGM following the ecommerce giant’s purchase of the studio that Variety famously dubbed “the Lion.” Valenti’s arrival was seen as sign that the enlarged studio operation was getting serious about revving up a slate of commercial theatrical films. Valenti’s experience ranges from Harry Potter franchise films to Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” to LEGO movies that helped revive Warner Bros.’ feature animation activity. Now she’s been entrusted with one of filmdom’s crown jewels, James Bond. Valenti’s first move was to turn to seasoned franchise film pros, Amy Pascal and David Heyman, to shepherd Agent 007 into a new chapter with a new star. Amazon MGM also has a big swing coming in June with Mattel’s followup to “Barbie,” the live-action “Masters of the Universe.” Title: CEO, Warner Music Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Kyncl has played captain at Warner Music Group as it’s undergone major restructuring, including last year’s elevation of Elliot Grainge to CEO of subsidiary Atlantic Music Group and waves of company-wide layoffs. And while full-year annual profit for 2025 declined 23%, largely due to the termination of WMG’s distribution deal with BMG, publishing and recorded music revenue thrived, surging 14.6 percent to $1.87 billion. Much of that can be credited to the success of various WMG artists — Rosé, Alex Warren and Sombr, to name a few. Under Kyncl’s leadership in 2025, WMG struck major licensing deals with AI startups Klay and Udio, the latter of which it had previously sued for copyright infringement. He has an ambitious blueprint to lead the company into the future — he even wrote a “10 year plan” for the company — but its execution will be a challenge. Title: Chairman, Sony Pictures Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Le Goy is a longtime Sony Pictures Entertainment insider who is well positioned to help drive the parent company’s efforts to find connections among the company’s autonomous entertainment-focused units: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music and Sony PlayStation. He previously headed worldwide distribution and networks, which gives him a strong sense of the company’s range of production and channel assets in the U.S. and abroad. Before Sony, Le Goy oversaw European distribution for Disney TV. Title: Head of Global TV, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: After a long run at Netflix, Peter Friedlander in October moved across town to lead global TV for Amazon MGM Studios. His front-row seat to the Netflix revolution will serve him well as Amazon MGM calibrates its TV strategy for Prime Video and elsewhere. Friedlander is extremely well connected in the creative community after years at Netflix and at Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman’s Playtone banner before that. All of those contacts and a big hunk of the goodwill he has in the bank will come in handy as the studio looks for growth. Title: CEO, Microsoft Gaming Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Beginning with an internship in 1988, Phil Spencer has been a Microsoft employee for longer than many of his biggest fans have been alive. Now head of Microsoft Gaming, Spencer oversees brands including Xbox, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Throughout many years at the company, Spencer has launched several consoles, including the current generation Xbox Series X and S and this year’s debut of the ROG Ally handheld collection, and overseen video game franchises including “Call of Duty,” “Minecraft,” “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Starfield,” “Doom” and “Forza.” While navigating industry criticism and fan backlash this year amid workforce reductions and price increases, Spencer has also drawn praise for his commitment to backing Xbox’s subscription Game Pass service and licensing out Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, making those the new priority drivers of growth as console sales dwindle. The successful adaptation of the “Fallout” gaming franchise into an Amazon Prime Video drama series was another feather in Spencer’s cap. Title: Chairman and CEO, Take-Two Interactive Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Strauss Zelnick began his career in Hollywood at Columbia Pictures, home video distributor Vestron and Twentieth Century Fox. But he segued into big-league investing and video games nearly 20 years ago through his ZMC investment vehicle. Take-Two is home to one of gaming’s most valuable franchises, “Grand Theft Auto.” The company will be under renewed scrutiny in 2026 after multiple delays in the release of the long-waited “Grand Theft Auto VI.” The most recent was the news from November 2025 that the title would be pushed by six months from May to November 2026. By that time it will have been 13 year since the debut of “GTA 5.” Outside of Take-Two, Zelnick may well wind up with a bigger footprint in entertainment if ZMC finds opportunities in the M&A wave that is gripping traditional media and entertainment. Title: Founder, chairman and CEO, Roku Held job since: 2002 Sources of power: Wood has generally kept a low profile in Hollywood since his entrepreneurial drive lead him into media in the late 1990s. He represents the “Halt and Catch Fire” era of cutting-edge digital products and savvy business leaders that emerged from the tech boom in Texas in the 1980s and ‘90s. Wood was early to see the opportunity for more consumer-friendly on-demand platforms, and that positions Roku well for the future as streaming becomes the dominant TV and home entertainment delivery system. Title: Founder and CEO, Spotify Held job since: 2006 Sources of power: After more than two decades in his role at Spotify, Ek is poised to step down from CEO at the streaming company at the end of 2025 while remaining executive chairman. His making the change — to the degree he actually steps back — on a high note: Throughout his tenure, he made Spotify the premium destination for streaming and saved an industry that was collapsing under the weight of illegal downloading. He ushered Spotify to its current market cap of $118 billion and grew its audience to 713 million active users and 281 million subscribers, up more than 10% from 2024. Ek spent the year diversifying Spotify’s outside investments, inking a deal with Netflix to stream a collection of original podcasts and another with Amazon to give advertisers using Amazon DSP programmatic access to Spotify’s streaming audio and video inventory. Title: Co-CEO, Comcast Held job since: 2025 (announced to take effect in January) Sources of power: Will have significant say over company’s future direction as Roberts cedes some of his CEO duties.Cavanagh is taking more of the reins at Comcast as Brian Roberts looks to do more with exploring technology. He brings to Comcast an outlook forged in part by time on Wall Street. He was He was the co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s Corporate & Investment Bank from 2012 to 2014, and served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years. Look for Cavanagh to have a big say over Comcast’s policies governing potential mergers-and-acquisitions; investment in sports rights; and balancing the need to grow its streaming assets while keeping interest in its still-sizable linear TV footprint. Title: Chief Creative Officer, Pixar Animation Studios Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Pixar’s has had its highs and lows at the box office in recent years but the animation studio’s brand nonetheless remains a magnet for kid and family audiences. Docter stepped up to the top creative job in 2018 when the company faced a moment of sudden transition after the exit of longtime creative leader John Lasseter. Docter was one of Pixar’s first employees long before the pioneering CG animation shop was part of Disney. He is respected for maintaining Pixar’s culture of creativity even as it has stepped up its production slate. Title: VP of Film, Netflix Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Longtime Sony executive Belgrad has spent his career making theatrical movies across a spectrum of budgets, making him an ideal partner for Dan Lin at the Netflix film vertical. Belgrad, for starters, manages the streamer’s important relationship with pay-one partner Sony Pictures (the union that gave us the “KPop Demon Hunters” juggernaut). Belgrad has been vital to get live-action features for Netflix out of that deal, including the upcoming “People We Meet On Vacation” and Kevin Hart’s “72 Hours.” He’s also brought key new filmmakers into the fold — like Clint Bentley, Lena Dunham and James Mangold — and scored big auction packages including the “Eloise” movie with Amy Sherman-Palladino and producer Ryan Reynolds; as well as “Unabom” with Russell Crowe and Shailene Woodley. Title: President, Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The exceedingly likable Greenbaum took a giant leap up from his longtime post at Searchlight Pictures to replace Sean Bailey at Disney’s mothership this year. He now oversees all live action filmmaking for the Walt Disney label and acts as steward for 20th Century Studios. Across both, he shepherds key filmmakers and – as the town has taken note – is actively courting original IP to serve younger audiences (particularly boys). Over his first few months, Greenbaum landed an action-drama package about the Hawaii mafia with Martin Scorsese and Dwayne Johnson, a hot time travel thriller from Edward Berger and Austin Butler, and the rights to Katherine Rundell’s fantasy series “Impossible Creatures.” Title: CEO, Neon Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Tom Quinn launched Neon in 2017 and quickly established it as one of the hottest brands in the indie film world. Under his leadership, Neon has become a major awards season player. It captured Best Picture for 2019’s “Parasite,” which made history as the first foreign film to win the top prize. Then pulled off the feat a second time with 2024’s “Anora,” a $6 million dark comedy that ranks as one of the lowest budgetted Best Picture victors ever. He’s also released such Oscar-nominated films as “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” and “I, Tonya.” Beyond arthouse fare, Neon scored at the box office with a series of twisty horror flicks, “The Monkey” and “Longlegs,” from Osgood Perkins, with whom the company has a first-look deal. However, Perkins’ latest film, “Keeper,” was a rare miss. In 2025, Neon released one of its most critically acclaimed slates, distributing Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just An Accident” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” both of which are expected to factor heavily into the Oscar race. Title: Chairman, Focus Features Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Peter Kujawski is a well-liked figure in the film community for his enthusiasm for movies and moviegoing, and for his taste in filmmakers and projects. He’s been a steady hand at Focus Features since 2016, but and he had an earlier run at the unit’s outset in 2002, where he played a big part in the releases of such notable pics as Michel Gondry’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Sofia Coppola’s Lost In Translation” and Gus Van Sant’s “Milk.” His 2025 fall and winter slate was as an ambitious as any distributor that tackled adult dramas: “Bugonia,” “Hamnet” and “Song Sung Blue.” Title: CEO and Founder, Blumhouse Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Blum has made his mark in Hollywood with his distinctive approach to horror films and his financial prowess. In short, he figured out to do micro-budget production at scale. And even in a year when the much-anticipated sequel “MEGAN 2.0” fell flat, the company’s eight theatrical film releases in 2025 still passed the $1 billion mark at the box office. Blumhouse has also expanded significantly since the current iteration of the company was formed in 2015. This year, Blumhouse bolstered its core business by completing its merger with James Wan’s Atomic Monster. Title: Co-Founder, A24 Held job since: 2012 Sources of power: The eternally mysterious Fenkel and Katz, who won’t even agree to be photographed on the annual Oscars red carpet, continued their streak as one of the most enviable labels in indie film while quietly growing their company from within. A24 saw the most profitable run of its existence this year, largely thanks to the overperformance of Celine Song’s “Materialists” (over $100 million at the global box office on a $20 million budget). Strong singles and doubles came with Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” “Friendship” and “Bring Her Back,” and “Mary Supreme” is set to light up the specialty box office at Christmas. At the top of this year, Thrive Capital closed an investment round that sources say brings A24’s valuation to roughly $3.5 billion. Title: VP of Original Series, Netflix Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Howe got the nod to run original scripted series for the U.S. and Canada at Netflix after her longtime boss, Peter Friedlander, departed for a new gig as head of global series for Amazon MGM. Howe has been a key player for years in Netflix’s original content strategy, playing an instrumental role in such series as “Bridgerton,” the Emmy-winning “Beef” and “The Diplomat.” Now she’s heading up the biggest sandbox in series development. Title: Chairman, Bravo and Peacock Unscripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Berwick has seen her job description and title at NBCUniversal change numerous times over the past decade, but her focus rarely wavered. She has been the driving executive force behind Bravo even before NBC bought the cable channel in 2002. With NBCUniversal slimming down through the spinoff of USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, E!, Berwick’s new role in the restructuring unveiled in January 2025 is tailored to her strengths. That’s demonstrated by Peacock’s success with unscripted shows including “The Traitors’ and “Love Island USA” and the fans flocking to BravoCon events in recent years. Title: President, CBS Studios Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: David Stapf is among the elite list of top Hollywood executives who began their career in publicity and communications before transitioning into senior management. After helping launch iconic series like “Friends” and “ER” at Warner Bros. TV, he moved to a current programming job at CBS in 1999, stewarding series like “Everybody Loves Raymond.” In 2004 he moved over to CBS’ in-house studio, where he was key to the launch and growth of “NCIS” and its spinoffs. He also developed “The Good Wife” and its spinoffs with Robert and Michelle King, and is guiding Kathy Bates’ successful “Matlock” series. Stapf brought the “Star Trek” world back to life on TV with “Star Trek: Discovery,” “Picard,” “Lower Decks,” “Strange New Worlds” and “Starfleet Academy.” In late night, he oversaw the launches of Stephen Colbert’s and James Corden’s talkers — and their wind downs (including Colbert’s exit this coming May). And he launched the first new daytime soap in years, CBS’ “Beyond the Gates.” Stapf even expanded his domain as a supplier for streamers like Netflix, and as an international producer on shows including “Colin From Accounts” and “King & Conqueror.” Title: Chairman of Business Affairs and Operations, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Jimmy Horowitz is widely respected as an honest broker and a shrewd dealmaker. He’s been a major player in driving business and monetization across the film studio for decades; more recently his purview has expanded to include television. He’s connections and his experience will no doubt come into play as NBCUniversal completes the Versant spinoff and reinvents itself once again around NBC, Universal film and TV production, Bravo and Peacock and theme parks. Title: President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Schrier came up the ranks under John Langraf at FX, which gives him a level of respect and connections in the creative community that he will need to help reinvent Disney’s TV production operations. He was hand-picked by Dana Walden to steer the TV studios’ business operations. In recent years, Schrier has invested in time and resources into growing Disney’s local-language activity for Disney+ and other production activity outside the U.S. Title: President, Warner Bros. Television Group Held job since: 2024 Source of power: The future of Warner Bros. Television Group may be uncertain as Netflix and Paramount Skydance battle it out for the studio. But there’s no doubt that Paul has played an enormous role in the company’s success over the past 30 years. He’s a well regarded dealmaker who has always nurtured strong relationships with WB’s top talent. Title: President, ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: OConnell has the hard task of managing the operations of ABC News and leading business operations for Disney’s linear networks, including ABC, FX Networks, Freeform and National Geographic. She’s managing businesses that are inevitably in decline while Disney’s streaming platforms gain steam. But Disney is also working across the company to leverage the reach and deep footprint (for now) of ABC, FX and the larger cablers to help bolster Disney+ and Hulu and to squeeze more value out of high-priced premium shows. OConnell earned the esteem of her colleagues by handling the tricky transition of leadership at ABC News just a few months after her role was expanded to encompass the division. Title: CEO, AMC Networks Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Dolan has been slowly shifting the centers of gravity that the company she took over in February 2023. AMC Networks is home to AMC, SundanceTV, IFC, WeTV and BBC America, as well as streamers Shudder, Acorn TV and ALLBLK. Dolan worked with Netflix and HBO Max to find bigger showcases for AMC-branded shows. She also has pull as a member of the family that controls the closely held company. Title: CEO, AMC Theatres Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Adam Aron, who became the CEO of AMC Theatres in 2016, has learned to embrace the disruption. Over the past few years, he’s survived a pandemic that devastated his business and withstood rollercoaster share prices amid a box office that has failed to regain its pre-pandemic strength. Rather than relying entirely on the studios that supply the blockbusters, Aron has made several attempts to expand AMC’s business outside of box office, including the viral “Dune” popcorn bucket and other movie-themed merchandise that has contributed tens of millions in annual sales. He also spearheaded the chain’s foray into distribution with 2023’s commercial hit “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film and this year’s “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl.” And he turned AMC into the de facto choice for movie lovers after hiring Nicole Kidman for the chain’s now-iconic promotional campaign to get people back to the movies. (Patrons even petitioned when AMC attempted to shorten the commercial, in which Kidman famously declares that “somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.”) Now that’s movie magic. Title: CEO, Imax Corp. Held job since: 2009 Sources of power: Blockbuster directors and stars like Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise and Ryan Coogler are known to rhapsodize about the singular experience of watching their films in Imax, a premium film format that has skyrocketed in popularity since COVID. That makes Richard Gelfond, who controls access to the finite number of screens that tend to generate outsized ticket sales, a very popular person when those mega-watt talents have a new movie to unveil. Thanks to Gelfond’s key relationships, Imax has benefited in recent years as audiences opt for premium large formats to distinguish the out-of-the-home moviegoing experience. When Gelfond joined Imax in 1994, the company was best known for supplying science documentaries to theaters inside museums. Over the decades, Gelfond, who became CEO in 2009, has turned the technology brand into a legitimate powerhouse in Hollywood. Title: President, Paramount Television Studios Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Matt Thunell sits atop Paramount Television Studios operations, a unit formed in August, post-merger out of the assets of Skydance Television, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Nickelodeon Live Action and Awesomeness. He’s got an opportunity to rev up a franchise factory for the enlarged studio. Paramount TV Studios is home to the Taylor Sheridan-verse, Paramount+’s “Yellowjackets,” among other shows. Thunell worked on “Stranger Things” at Netflix before he joined Skydance to head the TV unit in 2022. Title: CEO, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Grode may not be as flashy as some chiefs in town, but his stable of intellectual property provides all the shine he needs to keep Legendary at the top of the popcorn conversation. 2025 brought the staggering success of “A Minecraft Movie,” the almost billion-dollar-grosser that Grode’s studio executed with Warner Bros. While Legendary will be moving south of Burbank for a new distribution pact with Paramount, the label will release a third “Dune” film in 2026, as well as more monsters from the Godzilla universe and a hotly anticipated adaptation of beloved arcade game “Street Fighter.” Title: Vice Chair of Worldwide Production, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Parent’s range of experience — from a long run at Universal Pictures to MGM to New Line Cinema early in her career — gives her the perspective and business connections to drive promising film and TV projects for Legendary. Her depth alone makes Legendary an attractive partner for studios looking for reliable popcorn fare. Title: President, Searchlight Pictures Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Greenfield rose up the leadership ladder at Searchlight after working as a film producer and at the Sundance Institute. He’s highly regarded in the industry for his taste and for championing strong filmmakers. He was a key player in helping Searchlight make the transition into Disney after the 21st Century Fox acquisition in 2019. Title: CEO, Fox Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Rob Wade was already a reality TV veteran in the U.K. (“Big Brother,” “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here”) when he crossed the pond in 2005 to work on the first season of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.” He eventually became the showrunner of “DWTS.” He also headed up U.S. TV at Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment, working on shows like “America’s Got Talent” and “The X Factor.” After a stint as head of entertainment development at BBC Worldwide, Wade joined Fox in 2017 as president of alternative entertainment and specials, overseeing an unscripted slate such as “The Masked Singer,” “Lego Masters” and “Hell’s Kitchen.” He was there when Disney acquired Fox’s studio operations, making the network a stand-alone indie — and giving him and then-CEO Charlie Collier license to be entrepreneurial. When Collier left for Roku in 2022, Wade was tapped by Lachlan Murdoch to continue leading Fox’s evolution in entertainment. Title: President and CEO, Starz Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Starz is settling into its next chapter after completing a long and complicated spinoff process from parent company Lionsgate. Now Hirsch and his team have more control to guide Starz’s transition away from linear cable to subscription streaming. Hirsch’s background in marketing has helped Starz make the most of its most popular franchises such as the “Power” drama series and the “Outlander” fantasy universe. Title: President and Chairman, A+E Global Media Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Buccieri has worked to transform A+E Global Media’s operations since he was promoted to the top job in 2018. He’s made savvy licensing deals that protected the company’s core business but generated cash flow from the FAST channel licensing bonanza of the past few years. Under Buccieri, Lifetime, History and A&E Network have gained respect for investing in a slate of event programs rather than joining the original series arms race. He’s also highly regarded as a manager – skills he will need as parent companies Disney and Hearst quietly shop their long-standing joint venture to prospective buyers. Title: Chair & Chief Creative Officer, Lionsgate Television Group Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: In an industry filled with executive shuffles and organizational changes, Kevin Beggs has been a stalwart at Lionsgate Television Group. He first joined the company when it was a much smaller entity and helped grow it over the years to critical acclaim with signature hits like “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and “Orange Is the New Black.” This year, Lionsgate earned 25 Emmy nominations — including 23 Emmy nods for Apple TV+’s “The Studio,” which went on to win a record-breaking 13 Emmys — the most ever for a comedy in a single season. Overseeing a group that includes Lionsgate TV, Lionsgate Alternative TV, Lionsgate Worldwide TV Distribution, 3 Arts Entertainment and Debmar-Mercury, Beggs boasts current series hits including Season 5 of “Ghosts” (CBS), “The Hunting Wive” (Netflix), Season 3 of “Power Book IV: Force” (Starz), “Spartacus: House of Ashur” (Starz), “The Rainmaker” (USA Network), Season 13 of “My Big Fat Fabulous Life” (TLC) and the syndicated strips “Family Feud” and “Sherri.” In addition, 3 Arts is involved with shows like “Hacks” (HBO Max) and “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix). Title: Global Head of Music, YouTube Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Cohen is coming up on a decade of steering music activity for the streaming behemoth. His deep background in the business have come in handy as YouTube debates issues around AI use in the making of music and videos showcased on the site. More recently he’s waded into a dispute with Variety’s sibling publication Billboard about how YouTube streams are counted in Billboard’s chart rankings of music sales. Title: VP of Audio, Twitch and Games, Amazon Held job since: 2012/2023 Sources of power: A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Boom’s remit sprawls across Amazon Music, Audible, Twitch, Amazon Games, and Creator Services, the latter of which is a new program that leads the company’s creator-led podcast studio under the Wondery brand, including Dax Shepard’s Golden Globe-nominated “Armchair Expert,” “Mind the Game” with Lebron James and “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce. Initiatives in the past year include Bad Bunny’s final San Juan residency show, “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,” which became Amazon Music’s all-time most-watched livestream; working with Bad Bunny to launch STEM education programs, agricultural support, and economic development in Puerto Rico; welcoming media-challenged artists like Justin Bieber and Lizzo to Twitch; and developing Alexa+ into a music-recommendation tool. Title: President, Crunchyroll Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: As anime fandom has grown exponentially, Crunchyroll is well positioned to capture subscribers, audience and street cred with fans. The subscription streaming platform owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment has been a success story for the studio, which has made a point of investing in anime assets. Crunchyroll’s emergence on a larger stage was cemented in September when its feature film “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” lead the U.S. box office for two weekends. Purini has deep credentials with fans thanks to his long run at anime shop Funimation before Sony engineered its merger with Crunchyroll in 2021. Title: Chairman and CEO, AEG Presents Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: In any other universe, the man at the top of a live-entertainment empire that includes Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, Elton John’s five-year “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” trek, the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history (Zach Bryan at Michigan Stadium: 112,408 fans), the Rolling Stones’ recent tours, Coachella, Stagecoach, Sabrina Carpenter, Morgan Wallen and much more would be the Goliath of his industry. However, AEG Live’s main competition is the mighty Live Nation. But Marciano and his AEG Live team give Rapino & Co. a run for their money every year. Partnerships — with Louis Messina for Swift, with Goldenvoice’s Paul Tollett for Coachella and Stagecoach, with Latin powerhouse CMN Events — are a key strength, and he’s also more than doubled the company’s venue portfolio to over 100 (which include L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena and the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas), and also runs other iconic events like London’s BST Hyde Park, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many more across the globe. Titles: Co-Founders and Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Classics Held job since: 1992 Sources of power: “Michael and Tom,” as they are unanimously known, are part of the furniture here in Hollywood. They are lifelong devotees of art house titles that, more often than not, find a foothold in the mainstream and keep their parent label Sony Pictures in the awards conversation each year. For 2025, they rolled out Jodie Foster’s psychological murder mystery “A Private Life” and Iraq’s stellar bet for this year’s Oscars in “The President’s Cake.” And they may have a dark horse best actor winner on their hands for Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Title: Founder, Chairman and CEO, Allen Media Group Held job since: 1993 Sources of power: Byron Allen has demonstrated that he has tenacity to spare in building the media company that he started with a single syndicated TV show that he hosted. Today, Allen Media Group encompasses more than a dozen TV stations in small- and medium-size markets, the Weather Channel and niche lifestyle and genre channels. He’s been expanding in streaming with the college sports and lifestyle platform HBCUGo platform. He also owns the indie film distribution service Freestyle Digital Media. Title: Chief Brand Officer, Walt Disney Co.; President, Disney Entertainment Marketing Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Asad Ayaz has the single-biggest marketing portfolio of any CMO in entertainment. And because Disney is Disney, he has the extra burden of serving as both promoter and protector of the big-D brand that is synonymous with America, apple pie and Mickey Mouse. Ayaz also has a huge remit in overseeing all ballyhoo activity at the studio’s film and TV production imprints and Disney+. Title: President of Marketing, Direct to Consumer and Disney Entertainment Television Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Ryan oversees a roster of platforms and brands of size and scope that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. With her promotion in August, Ryan added oversight of all Disney’s direct to consumer marketing in addition to Disney’s TV studios and linear channels. The job of bringing viewers to the screen has become more complicated in the subscription streaming age. It falls to Ryan and her teams to help build up Disney’s growth engines of the future. Title: Head of Marketing, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Sue Kroll is skilled at selling movies. The former Warner Bros marketing chief was responsible for major promotional campaigns, including “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as awards fare like “Argo” and “The Blind Side.” So when Amazon MGM decided to get into the theatrical business and ramp up its film slate, the studio recruited Kroll – reuniting her with Courtenay Valenti, Amazon MGM’s head of film and Warner Bros. former production chief – to market its movies to the masses. The studio admittedly hasn’t had a ton of theatrical offerings since Amazon MGM committed to the big screen. (Making movies takes time.) So 2026 releases, including the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy,” Ryan Gosling’s space drama “Project Hail Mary” and Colleen Hoover adaptation “Verity,” will be a better showcase of Kroll’s talent. And once they get around to casting the next James Bond, she’ll be responsible for shaking and stirring the 007 franchise for a new generation. Title: Chief Marketing Officer, Universal Pictures Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Moses is one of filmdom’s most respected and well-liked marketing mavens. He has the experience and the No. 1 opening weekends to back it up. His latest victory that impressed fellow CMOs far and wide was his assignment to open not one but two movie musicals tied to a beloved Broadway property with a one-year gap in between. Moses and his team made sure that you couldn’t miss the candy-colored fanfare for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” Next up he faces a Homeric challenge with the release of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” in July. Title: CEO, ITV Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: McCall has carefully managed ITV’s response to the rapidly changing business landscape for media. She took the reins after her predecessor acquired a slew of small production banners to feed the company’s content pipelines. She came in as a strong experienced executive manager who helped quiet the persistent rumors that ITV would be sold, although that may change as another wave of merger mania grips Hollywood. Title: CEO, Canal+ Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Maxime Saada, a shrewd businessman whose mantra is “buy less, own more,” has transformed Canal+ Group from a largely French pay-TV operator into a leaner, financially robust global media company spanning Europe, Africa and Asia. Since taking the helm in 2015, Saada has quadrupled the group’s subscriber base to more than 40 million across 70 countries, while tightening cost structures, cutting losses and sustaining a €5 billion annual investment in content. Saada joined Canal+ Group in 2004 and moved through the ranks, has fueled the company’s growth through targeted acquisitions, including stakes in The Pictures Company in the U.S., Nordic pay-TV group Viaplay and Asian streamer Viu, capped this year by the takeover of MultiChoice Group, cementing Canal+’s leadership in Africa. In parallel, Saada secured a 34% stake in UGC, reinforcing vertical integration alongside Studiocanal, the producer behind “Paddington.” Title: Chairman and CEO, Mediawan Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: In an industry reshaped by consolidation and volatility, Capton has engineered a rare European success story with Mediawan. The self-made French producer co-founded Mediawan with telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle in 2015. Ten years and (likely) over a thousand transatlantic flights later, Capton has turned Mediawan into one of Europe’s leading production-distribution players amid a fiercely competitive market, generating upwards of $1 billion in annual revenues and housing over 80 labels worldwide, including the producers of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Miraculous” and “Call My Agent” — with a movie spinoff in post boasting George Clooney and Eva Longoria cameos, and a U.S. remake set in the sports representation worlds with HBO and SpringHill. Capton has been the architect of this international expansion, gaining the trust of high-profile talent and spearheading headline-making acquisitions that put the company on the English-language map, including majority stakes in Oscar-winning banners such as Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner’s Plan B (“Adolescence,””F1”), and “Slow Horses” producer See-Saw Films. Capton also just enlisted Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap for a joint venture based in London. Title: Founder and CEO, Mubi Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: A Turkish-born film fanatic, Efe Cakarel had never been to a film festival when he wrote the business plan for Mubi in 2007, envisioning an edgier alternative to Netflix. Eighteen years later, the London-headquartered company has evolved from a niche streamer into a full-fledged studio spanning theatrical distribution and production, with more than 400 employees across 15 markets. Mubi broke through in the U.S. with Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror breakout “The Substance,” which it distributed in theaters and grossed $83 million worldwide in 2024. It also earned five Oscar nominations, which meant that the ceremony last March marked Cakarel’s first trip to the Academy Awards. Cakarel, who says he “built Mubi brick by brick,” remains bullish on reinvigorating moviegoing culture. Title: Vice Chair, CJ Group Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: Miky Lee has spent the past two decades building the infrastructure that helped rebuild Korean’s entertainment industry. Appointed vice chair in 2004, she oversaw CJ’s shift from domestic film and TV operations into a vertically integrated entertainment group with reach across Asia and the U.S. Under her watch, CJ-backed projects included Oscar winner “Parasite,” while platforms like KCON and the Mnet Asian Music Awards grew from local showcases into international fixtures. As global demand accelerated, Lee pushed CJ further into the U.S., backing CJ ENM’s majority acquisition of Endeavor Content, now Fifth Season, and the launch of the First Light StoryHouse label with Janet Yang. As Korean film, TV and music have broken firmly into the U.S. mainstream, Lee remains behind one of the few companies built to operate across all three at scale. Title: CEO, Banijay Entertainment and Banijay Live Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: Marco Bassetti is navigating the current age of consolidation without losing sight of the bottom line. As streamer budgets shrink and linear channels lose relevance he is judiciously continuing to grow the company’s footprint while attaining scale with a wide range of premium content. Scale gives Banijay leverage in its negotiations with streaming giants and bolsters its efforts to retain IP ownership rather than selling it outright. The company’s production side, that includes brands such as “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Black Mirror,” is looking to expand its reach in English-speaking markets, including the U.S., though Bassetti is not planning to compete directly with Hollywood studios in the scripted sphere. Diversifying beyond traditional TV content, Banijay since 2023 holds a majority stake in live entertainment outfit Balich Wonder Studios that is driving growth thanks to production of high-profile events such as the opening ceremony of the upcoming Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Banijay has also made inroads in the creator-led entertainment space, notably its Creators Lab launched with YouTube. Title: CEO, Versant Media Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Lazarus has taken on the job of transitioning NBCUniversal’s largest linear cable channels into a new company dubbed Versant Media, which will formally become a separate publicly traded entity from NBCUniversal in early 2026. Lazarus is well positioned to steer those outlets — USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel – into their next chapter given his roots in pay TV as a Turner Broadcasting alum. He’s exiting out of NBCUniversal after a 15-year run. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: NBCUniversal is investing heavily in sports and entertainment franchises. Matt Strauss’ job is to make sure the company makes a profit. NBCU has in recent months tested some unique strategies, including the launch of a new sports-focused cable network that delivers much of the content already available to users of Peacock. The new outlet lets people still connected to traditional systems enjoy the content and serves as a bargaining chip in negotiations with video distributors. Title: President, Sony Pictures Television Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pope has had a broad range of experience over the past 25 years, from rising fast at NBC to helping to launch Chernin Entertainment and Charter Spectrum’s programming venture. All of that background is helping her lead Sony Pictures Television. It’s the studio division that takes the company’s riskiest bets in scripted TV. SPT fielded a notable new series this year for Fox with the medical drama “Doc,” which debuted to strong reviews and audience in January. The series came back quickly — by design — with Season 2 debuting in September just as Season 1 episodes landed on Netflix. Title: Chief Financial Officer, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Wiedenfels is on track to take on the tough assignment of charting a future course for CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, Food Network and other WBD linear channels. If Paramount prevails in buying all of WBD, however, Wiedenfels won’t have an empire. Although the executive became a lightning rod amid WBD’s extensive cost cutting campaigns, Wiedenfels will be sought after as a media CEO after his experience restructuring WBD. Title: President, Disney Advertising Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Ferro has become a key figure in Disney’s TV kingdom as the company opened Disney+ to advertising and has expanded in streaming with ESPN and Hulu. She has deep knowledge of Disney’s operations and the value of Disney’s biggest brands. She’s earned the trust of Disney’s C-suite after delivering for the Mouse House in difficult times. Title: Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Marshall has grown his stature at NBCUniversal ever since he became the top executive in advertising sales. He distinguished himself in sales for the 2024 Paris Olympics and this year’s “Saturday Night Live” 50th anniversary celebration. He’s also been a driver of the company’s upcoming plans to celebrate NBC’s 100th anniversary and to go big on live sports. Title: President, Roku Media Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Collier was recruited to rev up Roku’s core media business by stepping up original content commissions and enhancing its advertising sales operation. Collier has worked to capitalize on Roku’s strengths by targeting its original series to complement trends and popular shows on channels and apps carried by Roku. He has also expanded its presence on Madison Avenue, tapping into his decades of experience in programming and ad sales. Title: Group CEO, Fremantle Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: If you’re in the business of game shows, then you’re in business with Fremantle. Mullin leads the production banner behind “American Idol,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and a host of game shows ranging from “The Price is Right” to “Family Feud.” On Mullin’s watch Fremantle has also expanded its efforts in scripted content. Title: CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation Studios Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Hulst oversees more than 20 individual studio groups and partnerships, which are responsible for some the industry’s most influential games including “The Last of Us,” “Ghost of Yotei,” “God of War,” “Helldivers II” and “Death Stranding 2.” While he was pulled back from serving as co-CEO of the PlayStation business overall earlier this year, Hulst holds significant power in the gaming biz and guides SIE’s film and TV strategy. Title: CEO, Mattel Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Yes, Kreiz is interested in selling toys — lots of them — across multiple different categories (dolls, toddler, preschool and more). But he’s repositioned the company to better exploit opportunities in other lines of business with Mattel’s fan-favorite brands, including with the company’s first movie: box-office bonanza “Barbie,” which indisputably became a cultural moment. He has loaded up more projects in the pipeline in film, TV, consumer products, games, live events and experiences, publishing and music. Kreiz’s background as CEO of Fox Kids Europe, Maker Studios and Endemol over the past three decades affords him a keen understanding of how to capitalize on the value of Mattel’s multigenerational fandoms through media. Title: Founder and CEO, Epic Games Held job since: 1991 Sources of power: Sweeney’s company parachuted into the zeitgeist with the hugely popular “Fortnite,” and the game’s success last year attracted Disney as a major strategic partner. The outspoken — if not combative — exec also has stood up to tech giants Apple and Google, battling them in court to try to force them to make their app store policies fairer for independent developers. Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine 3D graphics platform has been eagerly embraced by professional vfx artists and creators for its ease of use. Title: Chair, Dalian Wanda Group Held job since: 1988 Sources of power: For a decade, Wang Jianlin was the most visible symbol of China’s global entertainment ambitions, snapping up marquee Western assets and building the world’s largest cinema footprint. That expansion unwound after Beijing tightened controls on outbound capital and targeted highly leveraged overseas acquisitions, forcing Wanda into debt restructuring and the exit from assets such as AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment. What remains is narrower but durable. While Wang no longer controls Wanda Film, Wanda Cinemas continue to operate at scale under a brand synonymous with his legacy and are largely housed within Wanda Plaza properties he still owns. Overseas, Hoyts preserves exhibition muscle in Australia and New Zealand. Most resilient is Infront Sports & Media, whose grip on premium sports rights anchors Wang’s influence beyond film. His power now rests in infrastructure rather than dealmaking. The Business of Entertainment

Title: 5 MMO Games We Almost Got (And Why They Were Never Made)
URL: http://comicbook.com/gaming/list/mmos-never-released/
Time Published: 2025-12-23T17:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Brandon Zachary Game development on the most basic of titles is tricky enough, but massively multiplayer online role-playing games are a different beast entirely. MMORPGs have to be a big enough world to justify a player’s lengthy time commitment, while also being entertaining and engaging enough to keep them from migrating to other titles. The biggest MMORPGs (like Blizzard’s World of Warcraft and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile) have massive player bases, and there are other consistent titles in the genre like Star Wars: The Old Republic and DC Universe Online. However, there have been some heartbreaking cancellations over the years that resulted in some promising concepts never making it out of development. Here are some of the most exciting MMORPGs that players never got to dive into. Codenamed “Titan,” the Halo MMORPG was sent to bring Master Chief into the RPG space. Developed by Ensemble Studios, the game was initially inspired by the success of Ultima Online. The concept for a sci-fi-heavy MMORPG became a passion project for the developer. After the success of Halo: Combat Evolved, the sci-fi MMORPG was retrofitted into a Halo title and had a number of functional similarities to the hit Blizzard game. Intended to be a rival to World of Warcraft, Ensemble Studios split attention between this game and the RTS adaptation of the Halo franchise, Halo Wars. Although the game pioneered several concepts that would later be brought to life by other MMORPGs, leadership changes at Microsoft and the inevitable investment it would take time to turn a Halo MMORPG into a money maker resulted in the game being shut down. Amazon’s move into the world of gaming was an ambitious play that didn’t end up landing as well as the company had hoped. This resulted in some serious cuts to Amazon’s gaming teams in October. One of the biggest casualties of this was an open-world MMO game set during the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Developed by Amazon Games Orange County (the same team that produced New World: Aeternum), the game was formally announced in 2023 and described as being in early development. While the game would have benefited from Amazon’s resources and the natural connection to Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power TV show, the team reportedly had trouble figuring out how to make the game stand out from other fantasy MMORPGs like Standing Stone Games’ The Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft. Amazon Gaming has shut down many of its games as part of its recent layoffs, with reports suggesting that the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was among the games impacted and shut down by the cuts. EverQuest has been one of the most consistent MMORPG franchises in gaming history, launching in 1999 with the first entry in the series and eventually getting sequels like the PS2’s EverQuest Online Adventures and 2004’s EverQuest II. Formally announced in 2012, EverQuest Next was intended to be a fresh take on the material and would have featured the biggest sandbox world developed at the time. Development carried on for several years under the eye of Daybreak Game Company, which has successfully launched several MMORPGs over the years. Although the game was intended to launch on the PlayStation 4 and was even suggested to have some compatibility with the Oculus Rift, plans for the game came to a halt in 2016. According to the game’s development team, the team couldn’t find a way to make the expansive game “fun,” and the title was cancelled. Fans of EverQuest still have the earlier titles, with the most recent expansion launching in December 2025. Announced in 2010, Rockman Online was a collaboration between Capcom and Neowiz Games. Taking place in the distant future of the Mega Man/Mega Man X series, Rockman Online would have brought back the Maverick Virus and required the construction of several duplicate machines modeled after series mainstays X, Zero, Duo, and Cinnamon to combat the hordes of new corrupted robots. The game was in active development for two years, with gameplay trailers even revealing a 2.5D platforming gameplay style that felt consistent with the franchise’s history. Production moved along far enough that trailers and gameplay clips were revealed to the public, showcasing multiple Mega Man characters fighting alongside one another. There was even a promotional contest to let two lucky winners name characters in the game. However, management shifts at Neowiz Games pushed the game to the back burner, and it was formally cancelled in 2013. Stargate Worlds was an ambitious collaboration by Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment and the MGM film studio. The game was announced in 2006 and was set to be directly based on the cult classic series, Stargate SG-1. Game publisher FireSky became involved in 2008, announcing they were committed to helping bring the best game possible to life. However, in 2009, Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright (who had been brought into the development as a games creative consultant) revealed his doubts that the game would ever see the light of day. Although there were plans for a closed beta version of the game, and members of the press at the time were impressed by the early previews of the game, Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for bankruptcy in 2010.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google told employees it will be "ramping up" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card. The company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. PERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US. Tech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to "significant" delays, Business Insider reported. According to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience. Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered. "Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible," the memo read. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role. Google paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. The sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers. Google applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said. Google told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said. It also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are "not in good standing" with the company. "Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM," it read. MI means "moderate impact" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews. Have something to share?

Title: The biggest games industry news stories of 2025 | Year in Review
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-biggest-games-industry-news-stories-of-2025-year-in-review
Time Published: 2025-12-22T18:33:46Z

AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

Title: Microsoft layoffs: Perfect Dark VA says she recorded “entire chapters” before Xbox canceled reboot

Full Content:
New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. I’m guessing OP didn’t get a new car as a gift, so… got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a “free turkey” around the holidays. It wasn’t really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didn’t cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurant’s “signature” steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. We’ve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat ‘for the company’. We didn’t get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Still, investors are happy with the work Google is doing. Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent. Apple recently announced that 16-year Google veteran Amar Subramanya would be joining Apple as VP of AI following John Giannandrea's departure.

Title: I was laid off by Oracle 2 years ago and still can't find a job. I've blown through my savings and now sell antiques to stay afloat.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to

Title: Job seekers in 2025 faced a Great Frustration: never-ending applications, ghosting after interviews, and losing hope

Call it the Great Freeze — or the Great Frustration. Business Insider spoke with dozens of job seekers across generations in 2025, some of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. They voiced a wide range of frustrations about their searches — including slow hiring timelines, so-called "ghost jobs," suspected ageism, employers going silent midway through the process, overwhelming competition for each role, and the belief that AI filters are often screening their résumés before a human ever sees them. Their job-finding journeys come at a time when employers are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. Whether the job seekers blame AI, corporate efficiency pushes, or broader economic uncertainty, they say it all adds up to a deluge of applications and a dearth of job offers. Still, through the frustration, they've also found ways to cope and connect with a community of fellow job seekers. "I believe the hiring system is broken," said Matthew English, who's been looking for full-time work since October 2024 after a decadeslong career in accounting. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs — from accounting roles to the Chick-fil-A cow mascot — he's been unable to secure a full-time offer. He said he's burned through much of his savings, and that last Christmas, he couldn't afford to buy gifts for his family. "I have about drained my life's savings," said English, who is in his 60s and lives in Alabama. "Money that you're expecting to use in retirement is now being used to survive." The New York Fed regularly asks people to estimate the likelihood that, if they lost their job today, they'd be able to find a new one in the next three months. In August 2025, that average probability dropped to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013 — and has only recovered slightly in the months since. Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said 2025's labor market had "low momentum." "The cumulative effect of three years of slowdown — it's completely understandable why they feel like this might be the worst labor market they've ever been in," Kantenga said. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: Hilary Nordland began looking for work after being laid off from her marketing role in July 2024. To help pay the bills, she said she started donating plasma and drew on her retirement savings. Nordland, who's in her 50s and lives in Minnesota, said one of the most frustrating parts of her job search has been landing interviews — only to have opportunities fall through for unexpected reasons. She said she's had interviews canceled the same day they were scheduled because the role was suddenly put on hold or filled internally. On one occasion, she said, an HR representative told her she'd be a great fit — but the rep was fired before they could schedule the interview. "This job market is terrifying," she said. "It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through." US employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts so far in 2025, the most since 2020. While the unemployment rate remains relatively low by historical standards, it has risen to its highest level since 2021, when the economy was still recovering from pandemic-related disruptions. High demand for jobs — combined with the rise of AI-assisted applications — has contributed to an influx of submissions for open roles, making it harder for qualified candidates to stand out. Last quarter, the average job posting received 242 applications, nearly three times the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. Aaron Terrazas, an independent economist, said job seekers' frustration with this year's labor market was justified. "Just because the aggregate jobs data look stable, steady, slowing but stable, doesn't mean that it hasn't been very difficult for some people," Terrazas said. Heather Driscoll began looking for a healthcare management job after being laid off last year. She said she's struggled to pay the bills and had to draw on her 401(k). "The amount of time, research, enthusiasm — the dressing up, hair, makeup — just to sit on a Zoom call and get no feedback or rejection, is insane," she said. Driscoll, who's in her 50s and lives in Colorado, said she has reached the final interview round multiple times but has been unable to secure an offer. She suspects that ageism and sexism could be working against her. A challenging job market has forced some job seekers to confront the possibility that their goals and aspirations may be out of reach. At age 40, Kenneth Ferraro quit his job as a truck driver to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science at New York University. He hoped it would set him up for a career in public service — but after struggling to find work, he returned to trucking last year. He said he's stuck with more than $100,000 in student debt. While having a college degree improved his credentials, Ferraro said he thought his age had held him back in the job market. He recalled applying for an entry-level government position that seemed like a good fit. The early stages of the interview process felt promising, but he said things shifted after the in-person interview — and he suspects his age was a factor. "As soon as the hiring manager saw me, his whole demeanor changed," Ferraro said. "He ran through the questions and never truly engaged with me." Solomon Jones hoped that earning a college degree would open doors. After earning his bachelor's degree in sports communication in May, he struggled to find employment. Jones said that some of the sports communications job postings he'd come across had attracted more than 1,000 applicants. "The goal is to obviously get a job in the sports industry, but realistically, I know that life isn't fair," said Jones, who's in his 20s and lives in New Jersey. "So at this point, I'm just trying to find a job, period." Some job seekers Business Insider spoke with have leaned on others — including friends, family, professional contacts, and fellow job seekers — for support and solidarity during their job searches. After being laid off by Microsoft in May, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment, but eventually moved to Florida to save money by living with family while continuing his search. Carter said he's connected with others who've lost their jobs and visits the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout Microsoft's history. "Layoffs kind of affect people mentally," said Carter, who's in his 30s. "I've reached out to people so we can be each other's support system." In July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off by Intel for the second time. On his last official day with the company, his wife also lost her job. When he learned the news, his mindset shifted from "I'll find a job when I can" to "I'd better find a job." But over the past few months, he's struggled to make much headway. Ramkrishna said one of the things keeping him going is the support of his former Intel colleagues, who also lost their jobs. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said uncertainty helped drive this year's low-fire, low-hire job market, such as businesses navigating the effects of tariffs and AI. Terrazas, the independent economist, doesn't think uncertainty will fully fade next year, but said employers won't be facing the initial shock of policy changes from a new administration. Most job seekers can't afford to put their searches on hold until conditions improve. Despite the challenges, some have managed to break through. When Alexander Valen was laid off from his project manager role at Accenture, he was initially optimistic that his more than two decades of experience would help him land a new job. But after nearly two years of job searching — and falling behind on his mortgage — that optimism had vanished. Valen, who's in his 50s and lives in Florida, said he and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and help from family to get by. But a few months ago, someone in his network recommended he explore roles at the freelance platform Toptal. Valen applied for a project manager role, went through the interview process, and landed the position, which he said fell within the $80 to $100 an hour compensation range he'd been targeting. Valen's top advice for other job seekers: Reframe how you view the process — and lean on others along the way. "The search becomes far less discouraging when you treat it as an opportunity to grow rather than a verdict on your worth," he said. "And in a market this competitive, networking isn't optional — it's the force multiplier that ultimately led me to my role." Jump to
