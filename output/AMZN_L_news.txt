Title: Microsoft just revealed how much its flagship cloud platform makes—a whopping $75 billion a year

Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn’t disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant’s end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company’s quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft’s ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven’t changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn’t disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the “volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Trump's tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds

As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants" if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump's policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there's the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow" show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn't say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn't blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’'' he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” This webinar will introduce new properties for sale from Daiwa House, one of Japan's leading home builders. Join us August 2, 2025 from 11AM to Noon (Japan Standard Time). Learn More Innovate through Art The independent Tax Foundation has projected that Trump’s tariffs would raise $2.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade, but, through price increases, would effectively increase “taxes” on the average U.S. household by nearly $1,300 this year and nearly $1,700 in 2026, Additionally, these estimates understate the totality of effects Americans will face, as they exclude the loss of choice and higher prices for substitute goods. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. Then why is he pressuring the FED to lower interest rates? Tsk, tsk. It is extremely disloyal of commie Americans to pick holes in Glorious Leader's epic wins with scandalous fripperies such as 'facts', 'reality' and the pseudo-science of economics. Willingly suspend your disbelief and enjoy your utopia, as we are in Brexit Britain, awash with money, opportunities, services, low prices, peace and happiness. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday The data doesn’t concur. Reported mid-July by the Wall Street Journal: Consumer inflation accelerated in June, as the Trump administration's tariffs start to push up prices. The Labor Department's consumer-price index showed year-over-year inflation picked up to 2.7%. That was in line with expectations, and compares with 2.4% in May and 2.3% in April. The "core" measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 2.9%, in line with forecasts, and up from May's 2.8% rate. A small price to pay for our Freedomz and the leadership of Daddy. Patriots, open your wallets! The real question is how can you trust a man cheating at golf? Even more if he is a president? But but I heard it was going to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and make everyone richer. Closing factories, cutting jobs and raising prices? That’s not what maga voted for, is it? Record Private CAPEX now in US, so these many new auto, chip, pharma, steel, aluminum, etc. plants will soon be hiring as soon as plants come on-line. World benefits from having more sources of supply, Covid was a tough lesson in supply chain reliance etc. Trump not really bothered about Americans. He’s just spent millions of US taxpayers money opening another ‘globalist’ golf course in Scotland. He plays, you pay. Corruption is what MAGA voted for. every stick have two ends and americans will learn in heard way soon costs of these "nice deals" through own pockets soon. Bob Fosse But but I heard it was going to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and make everyone richer. Closing factories, cutting jobs and raising prices? That’s not what maga voted for, is it? I’m definitely not a Trump fan, but I would not expect a change in the manufacturing infrastructure of the U.S. to occur overnight, or even in this joker’s first few months of office. Would you? It’s also important to remember that only 40% of today's manufacturing jobs involve direct production. The greater percentage are in the fields of engineering, finance, logistics, systems, and marketing. I’m definitely not a Trump fan, but I would not expect a change in the manufacturing infrastructure of the U.S. to occur overnight, or even in this joker’s first few months of office. Would you? No, I wouldn’t. nice try media. have you checked the stock market and unemployment numbers? this si the best economy in history nice try media. have you checked the stock market and unemployment numbers? this si the best economy in history Erm..the article is talking about the possible effects of the tariffs which haven’t kicked in yet. Did you actually read it before getting triggered? Trump not really bothered about Americans. Are you talking about Trump or the last President who let in millions off illegal aliens and released all of them when they were arrested for serious crimes? Sounds like Biden didn't care to me. Oh they fell 210%... You obviously missed the point that prices can never fall more than 100% -- and 100% would mean the product is free, so gosh, I wonder why your gibberish wasn't a story. I don't really get it. Even if Trumps plan succeeds and production is moved to the US, this will make production much more expensive, since american workers after all make more than chinese workers. Is higher prices and factory jobs really the future you want? But but I heard it was going to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and make everyone richer. Closing factories, cutting jobs and raising prices? That’s not what maga voted for, is it? now that egg prices are down this is the talking point now. here is a summary: consumer confidence: all time high stock market: all time high unemployment: all time low illegal aliens: deported and at all time low republicans re-elected in 2026, ALL BUT CERTAIN These half-baked moves by the convicted felon and former Insurrectionist-in-Chief are part and parcel of the new abnormal. The world will pay a hefty price for decades to come. republicans re-elected in 2026, ALL BUT CERTAIN You are getting the hang of the idea of people looking at what could happen in the future. Progress of a kind. when are you all going to realize this is an extremely popular president How are you measuring this? Polls? Don’t look great for a president at this stage of his term. Oh they fell 210%... So, eggs became not only free but in America they now actually pay you to take them. Quite a ‘deal’. Anything concrete? Just a feeling? Dems love "concrete" data unless it is about illegal aliens or men beating up women in sports. then they do not like data. Here is some data, check the stock market. higher than at ANY POINT under Biden. Check the consumer confidence data as well Check the consumer confidence data as well Conference board consumer confidence index hit 97.2 in July - up from 95.2 in June. But it was 101.9 a year ago, and as high as 110.9 in January 2024. No surprise you have no clue what you're talking about - just MAGA making stuff up to gaslight the world. when are you all going to realize this is an extremely popular president with popular policies Someone has been hitting the bong a little too hard.

Title: AI Fears Become Reality In The Tech Industry

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Fears of artificial intelligence costing people their jobs are already proving to be true. Or at the very least, CEOs are now admitting to the technology’s impact as AI-related layoffs ramp up, especially in the tech industry, reports Forbes’ Richard Nieva. Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman is just the latest to say out loud that AI is already a threat to all kinds of jobs—including his. In an April memo to his 1,200 employees, he wrote: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me—that they aren’t imagining stuff.” He joins the likes of Andy Jassy at Amazon, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Shopify’s Tobi Lutke in admitting that AI will replace humans in white-collar jobs, some going as far as predicting a “white-collar bloodbath.” The impacts are already being felt, particularly for young coders and entry-level workers. The total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. But not everything can, or should, be automated just yet. Take the buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, for example, which last year slashed its workforce by 40% in part to the company’s investments in AI. A year later, it launched a massive recruiting push for human customer service agents. “We have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom told Forbes, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Why mastering “systems-thinking” skills could protect your job from AI. What to do when someone is hired above you. Amid all the hype, here’s why you may not need an AI agent. News from the world of work. Looking for lower costs, different lifestyles and less toxic politics, more Americans are considering retiring abroad.

Despite luring workers back into the office with the promise of free food, employers will no longer be able to deduct the cost of the food they provide for their employees as part of President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The only exceptions: restaurants and the Alaskan fishing industry. One seemingly innocuous kiss cam at a Boston Coldplay concert has caused quite the workplace drama at tech startup Astronomer, pushing the company into the internet’s spotlight. Former CEO Andy Byron stepped down after being caught embracing chief people officer Kristin Cabot at the concert, while the company’s cofounder and chief product officer Pete DeJoy has stepped up as interim chief executive. More than half of U.S. companies are looking to pare back on health benefits as weight loss spending soars, according to Reuters. Increased cost sharing means employers could raise deductibles or maximum out-of-pocket costs, or even look beyond traditional pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between patients and insurers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2DYvvBPRx4 Could Tesla’s Board Oust Elon Musk?

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Once again, equities rose for the week (ended July 25th) with the S&P 500 up nearly 1.5%, the Nasdaq just over 1.0%, the Dow just under 1.3%, and even small cap stocks participated (Russell 2000 +0.9%).1 The month to date numbers are positive for each index in the +1.4% to +4.0% range. 2025 year to date appears to be favoring the tech heavy indexes (S&P 500 and Nasdaq) but not so much the old-time industrials (DJIA) or small caps (Russell 2000). Six of the Magnificent 7 rose on the week with Tesla (TSLA -4.1%) the only laggard.2 Microsoft (MSFT) closed on Friday at a new record high and Nvidia posted a new high on Thursday (July 24th). It’s been quite a run for stocks since the April lows. Two stocks that don’t seem to be participating are Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). Apple is off its high by more than -17% and Tesla twice that (-34%).2 And both are off double digits year to date. The table shows that three of the seven (NVDA, MSFT, and META) are up more than 20% this year. Amazon and Google are also up, but in the single digit range.2 Meanwhile, the White House has reached an agreement with Japan, setting tariffs on Japanese imports at 15%.1 Markets reacted positively to that news and now await word on negotiations with the European Union (EU), the results of which appear to be coming shortly. The economies in the EU are softening and the European Central Bank (ECB) has moved their policy rate to 2%, the mid-point of their neutral range. Unlike the ECB, the Fed’s current reference rate (the Fed Funds Rate), at 4.25% to 4.50%, is significantly above the Fed’s stated 2% neutral rate.3 The Fed appears to have some catching-up to do. We don’t have to review the political theater that has been playing out between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell as it’s been all over the news. The independence of the Fed from a sitting Administration was written into the 1913 law establishing the Fed.4 [Imagine the economic damage and resulting inflation if sitting U.S. Presidents controlled the Fed!] The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) whose next meeting is in the last week of July, is composed of 12 members. They are the seven members of the Board of Governors (nominated by the sitting President and confirmed by the Senate), the President of the NY Fed, and four of the eleven remaining Regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents (on a rotating basis).5 Powell, while Chair and with a great deal of influence, is only one of the 12 votes on the FOMC. So even if Powell wanted to lower, it isn’t a slam dunk. The Fed knows that it takes several months for its policy changes to have a significant economic impact. A good example is mortgage rates. A lower Fed Funds Rate would likely push mortgage rates down, but the impact on the economy is slow (mortgage by mortgage). As noted below, housing has become slow, so, it would behoove the Fed to lower rates. Thus, as emerging data show a slowing economy, it is only fitting that they lower the Fed Funds Rate. But the Fed knows that its independence is of utmost importance. As a result, we expect the Fed to maintain the Fed Funds Rate where it is (4.25%-4.50%) at its late July meeting if for no other reason than to reassert its independence from the Administration. Markets agree. The Market’s odds of a rate decrease at the July meeting are a scant 2.6%.3 It is also clear that the President now realizes that he can’t force the Fed, that the Fed values its independence and will fight for it, and that if he wants lower interest rates, he will have to wait until the Fed’s September meeting (market odds of a September rate cut are 62%, as the market sees a softening economy making headline news at that time).3 Thus, it behooves the President to stop discussing monetary policy and lay off criticizing the Chairman. If that were to occur, and the Fed lowers in September, the economy would benefit. New home sales rose +0.6% in June to a 627K annual rate.6 But that’s where the good news ends. The consensus expectation was 650K, and the small rise in June barely dented the huge -11.6% falloff in May. The combined May/June performance was the worst two-month performance since late 2022. Inventory levels of those new, unsold, homes were at 9.8 months’ supply at existing sales rates, up from 8.5 months in April and 9.7 in May. As a result, the average price for new homes fell by -2.1% in June from May levels while the median price was off -4.9% from May and down -3.0% from a year ago. Things were no better in the existing home space. Home prices fell -2.7% in June from May levels and existing home sales are now below the levels that occurred at the beginning of the last three Recessions. So, this is a Big Deal! The months’ supply, at current sales rates, has risen from 3.5 months in February to 4.7 months currently, and Zillow reports that 25% of its listings reduced their asking price in June, the highest level for a June month since 2018. It is hard to not conclude that deflation is in the immediate future for residential real estate. Of greater concern here is that the value of that personal residence is the major asset for the vast majority of U.S. households, and lower values will impact future consumption via the “wealth effect,” i.e., consumers spend more/less when their net worth rises/falls. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) fell again in June (-0.3%), are down -4% from a year ago, and have been constantly negative for the past three years.7 While some may say these measures are obsolete, we still believe that they impart value to the overall economic picture. Currently, this index is at a ten-year low. It peaked in December 2021 and is down -17.8% since. The Philadelphia Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index came in at -10.3 for July (somewhat better than June’s -25.0, but still negative).8 It has been negative for nine months in a row, and its expectations index for six months hence, at -3.9, has also been negative for six months in a row. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index fell to -20 in July from -8 in June. Market expectations were for a -2 reading.9 And the Chicago Fed’s National Activity index (a model with 85 variables) showed up at -0.1 in June, negative now for three months in a row. Companies employing 100 or more must notify workers 60 days prior to layoffs. This is called Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN). Such notifications are up +23% over the past year. This means that weakness will be showing up in the employment data as the year progresses. Equity markets continue to march higher despite growing evidence of a slowing economy. Housing sales, both from new construction and from existing units have slowed precipitously and clearly need lower mortgage rates. Such rates are tied to the 10 Year Treasury yield. Other indicators show slippage in the economy. The Conference Board’s LEI, the Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, the Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index, and the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index have all been negative for several months. And higher layoffs appear to be just around the corner. Under normal circumstances, the Fed would be moving smoothly toward ease. But these aren’t “normal” times. Recent pressure by the White House on Chairman Powell has put the Fed’s independence in question and at risk. And, while the President has recently backed off, to put an exclamation point on the Fed’s independence, even at the risk of raising the odds of a Recession, it is highly likely that the Fed will not move rates lower at their late July meeting. The market’s odds of a July rate decrease recently fell to 2.6%!3 The next Fed meeting is in September. If the economy really deteriorates, there could be an inter-meeting move lower for the Fed Funds Rate, but that’s highly unlikely. So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on! Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. READ MORE: Big 3 automakers say Trump’s tariff deal with Japan puts them at a disadvantage “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. READ MORE: Trump is getting the world economy he wants — but the risk to growth could spoil his victory lap Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,” said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices” under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,” Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,”’ he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!

Title: Future Of Warner Bros. International TV Production Revealed

Time Published: 2025-07-29T14:44:21Z

By Jesse Whittock, Max Goldbart EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday unveiled its post-split leadership plan, but absent from the detail was any mention of the Warner Bros International Television Production studio. Although WBD’s American studios and production divisions are being folded into David Zaslav’s new Warner Bros. business, we can reveal that the London-based WBITVP will, in fact, fall under the Discovery Global biz, which will be led by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. The separation is expected to close in mid-2026. We understand Warner Bros and Discovery are moving towards post-split agreements on Warner formats that WBITVP already sells on the international market. Watch on Deadline Several sources alerted Deadline to WBITVP’s post-split shift upon yesterday’s announcement, and a rep for WBD confirmed the decision. It may seem surprising that the international studio will now be separate from the likes of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios, but insiders noted that the move is a logical one given that Discovery Global is international-facing. “One positive is it will have to be Euro-centric,” said one source in the continent. Furthermore, WBITVP already has a strong relationship with current WBD International President Gerhard Zeiler, who has become Discovery Global’s Chief Content Officer plus President in the U.S., UK and Germany. WBITVP President Ronald Goes is close with Zeiler, and the move allows the pair to continue working in lockstep, while continuing to work alongside Andy Zein, who is EVP Creative, Format Development and Sales. Sources said they expect more information on WBITVP’s post-split future in the coming days but downplayed the idea that there will be layoffs or mergers from within. One speculated that there may have been a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit. “It’s flattering that we aren’t just being shipped off, but it does seem right to be in this [Discovery Global] part of the business,” said the insider. WBITVP represents the rights to numerous Warner-created shows on the international market and makes the likes of The Bachelor, FBoy Island and Impractical Jokers via production hubs across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. In the UK, it owns First Dates producer Twenty Twenty, Who Do You Think You Are? maker Wall to Wall and The Repair Shop indie Ricochet. Also among WBITVP’s catalog are 25 scripted formats, with several coming from the U.S., such as Gossip Girl, The O.C. and The Mentalist. WBITVP’s central team, which is primarily based in Old Street, London but also has staff in the U.S., has more than 50 employees on the books, according to its website. We understand WBITVP will be staying put at its current base, where it and CNN Worldwide, which is also moving to Discovery, are housed. Zeiler appeared a big winner out of yesterday’s post-split announcement. The WBD veteran has taken on the U.S. President role at Discovery Global, working closely with Wiedenfels at the top table on strategy. WBD LatAm and U.S. Hispanic boss Fernando Medin steps into his President of International shoes, and we understand his post will focus on territories elsewhere and finding new revenue streams for Discovery’s local businesses. The likes of U.S. Ad Sales President Ryan Gould, distribution boss Scott Miller and content strategy EVP Fulvia Nicoli will all report into Zeiler. Other notable international names moving to Discovery include Kasia Kieli, who has retained her role as President and MD, Poland and CEO of Polish network TVN. Following a period of intense speculation, the WBD split was revealed last month. The seismic move separates the company along similar lines to rival Comcast’s spinning out of its cable networks from NBCUniversal. Lionsgate’s split from Starz was confirmed in May. Broadly, the separation of studios and broadcast networks from cable business is seen by most leaders and analysts as part of future-proofing against an increasingly dominant set of digital-first rivals such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon. Streaming’s rise and the continued decline of linear television have left investors confused and stock prices floundering, even with cable networks still posting very healthy profits. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” Zaslav said at the time. Warner Bros’ former parent, WarnerMedia, and Discovery first united under the latter’s long-serving chief, Zaslav, in April 2022. This formed the WBD business, which is now set to break apart again.

What a waste of potentially combining worldwide production operations to support a worldwide expanding SVOD service. I always thought WBITVP did not fit Warner Bros. and this is a good move How did you come to that conclusion? So a SVOD rolling out internationally only cares about US productions on the service and not making local versions for their international audiences? ridiculous. Fat cats ruining a legacy studio all over again. and keep chasing the streamers, you will never catch Youtube nor Netflix. never. They should be reinventing their business model not constantly copying someone elses, poorly. These legacy studios deserve to crumble into dust. We workers abhor the hand that feeds us.

Title: Trump voter and Montana Knife Co. founder feels tariff pain: His $515,000 sharpener from Germany is set to cost another $77,250

Download your cheat sheet and checklist to start building content that works harder. Your Competitors Have Already Started. You’ll learn why traditional SEO tactics still matter, how query fanout shapes which documents are selected, and what makes content truly quotable. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Exclusive interview about the publisher lawsuit, exclusive data on the confidence of AI trackers, AI Overviews, AI Mode, and how to upskill. It’s halftime. The first half of 2025 brought major shakeups in SEO, AI, and organic growth – and it’s time for a reality check. Traffic is down, revenue is … complicated, and large language models (LLMs) are no longer fringe. Publishers are panicking, and SEO teams are reevaluating how they measure success. And it’s not just the tech shifting; it’s the economy around it. The DOJ’s antitrust case against Google could reshape the playing field before Q4 even begins. In today’s Memo, I’m unpacking the state of organic growth at the midpoint of 2025: Plus, premium subscribers will receive my scorecard that will help evaluate whether the team is adapting effectively to the AI landscape. Let’s take stock of where we are, and what comes next. Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free! AI Overviews (AIOs) looked “interesting” to marketers in 2024 and “devastating” in 2025. The traffic loss impact ranges from 15% to 45% declines, from my own observations. Bottom-line metrics across the industry range from “traffic down, revenue up” to “traffic down, revenue down.” In February, I wrote in The Impact of AI Overviews that mostly the top of the funnel (TOFU) queries were impacted: Every study I looked at confirmed that the majority of AI Overviews show up for informational-intent keywords like questions. Shortly after, in March 2025, Google nullified that theory by dialing up the number of AIOs way beyond the top of the funnel. Ever since, U.S. companies have experienced a strong (negative) impact, and I’m hearing the phrase “SEO is dead” more often from leaders. Between 13 and 19% of keywords show AI Overviews, according to Semrush and seoClarity, but I assume the actual number is much higher because searchers use much longer prompts. (Prompts that most tools don’t track.) [1, 2] I expect organic traffic to keep dropping as the year moves forward. In theAIO Usability study I published in May, only a small fraction of clicks still came through to websites. It wouldn’t surprise me if 70% of the organic traffic that sites earned in 2024 is gone by 2026, leaving just 30% of that organic traffic behind. Scary? Yes. But traffic is just a means. The same study also shows that 80% of searchers still lean on organic results to complete their search journeys. So, I still feel optimistic about the value of organic search in the long term. There are two questions top of mind for me at the moment: In my view, either: With one exception. The whole internet is trying to figure out whether the value of showing up in LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, AI Mode, AI Overviews, etc.) is worth more than the loss in traffic. But without a doubt, publishers and affiliates are the group that gets hit the hardest due to their reliance on ad impressions and link clicks. No one needs traffic as much as publishers. The consequence? Leading publishers and news sites will conduct layoffs and assume that Google traffic will go to zero at some point. At a companywide meeting earlier this year, Nicholas Thompson, chief executive of the Atlantic, said the publication should assume traffic from Google would drop toward zero and the company needed to evolve its business model. [3] Publishers in the EU have banded together and filed an antitrust complaint against Google for its launch and the impact of AI Overviews with the European Commission. [4] Publishers using Google Search do not have the option to opt out from their material being ingested for Google’s AI large language model training and/or from being crawled for summaries, without losing their ability to appear in Google’s general search results page. I caught up with Chris Dicker, who leads one of the co-signatories in the DMA complaint against Google, the Independent Publishers Alliance: Kevin: What’s your role in the lawsuit against Google? Chris: The Independent Publishers Alliance is one of the co-signatories on the complaint. I am helping lead this from the Alliance side. Kevin: What would be an outcome, i.e., an action by Google, that would be satisfactory? Chris: We are only asking for what we deem to be fair, which is for a sustainable ecosystem. Whether that is payment for use of content or for Google to start to substantially reduce the zero-click searches, which have gotten significantly worse since the launch of AIOs. Kevin: Can LLMs (ChatGPT & Co) provide some remedy against the traffic drop from Google? Chris: Not for publishers at the moment, no. They don’t have scale or the want to send traffic anywhere else. The current CTR’s we are seeing and that are being reported from publishers are tiny. OpenAI’s scrape to human visit is 179:1, compared with Perplexity’s 369:1 and Anthropic’s 8692:1 (stats from Tollbit’s State of bots Q1 2025). For perspective, Bing’s is 11:1. I know there are reports that the traffic from LLMs is “better quality,” but not on the metrics that would help publishers or content creators. It is very much the opposite: Bounce rate is higher; pages per session and per visit are also both considerably down for AI search traffic compared to organic search. Kevin: What are the consequences of Google’s AI Overviews on independent publishers so far? Can you quantify the impact? Chris: It’s significant and something that has been extrapolated even since April this year. There are sites that are seeing traffic drops of up to 70% since April. Publishers have no choice but to cut costs and, unfortunately, that also means job losses. In the last year, we have had numerous members who, unfortunately, haven’t been able to weather the storm and have ceased publishing altogether, and these are respected sites that were well established over the last 10 years, if not longer. Kevin: Do you know of publishers that are able to dampen the negative impact from AI Overviews in some ways? If so, what are they doing? Chris: Nearly every publisher I speak to is actively diversifying away from Google. It feels inevitable that we’ll see a mass blocking of Googlebot at some point, something that would have been inconceivable just 12 months ago. If your business model still relies on search traffic, whether from traditional search or AI-powered results, it’s time to rethink – and fast. More publishers are now focusing on direct audience relationships through newsletters, forums, podcasts, and similar channels. Platforms like Substack offer an interesting model, though I’m not convinced their approach fully suits publishers just yet. Beyond monetizing websites and content, many publishers are also developing in-house creative, social, or AI agencies. After all, these businesses have spent years engaging and inspiring audiences. Helping advertisers tap into that expertise feels like a natural next step. Besides the fact that the open web and critical societal instances are fading away, from a purely practical standpoint, there are also fewer publishers to amplify content for other businesses. And yet, I believe we haven’t seen the full extent to which Google Search will change from sending traffic to answering questions directly. At a recent event I attended, a Google representative mentioned that Sundar Pichai sees AI Mode as the default search experience in the next two to three years, with searchers being able to switch to classic search results if they want to – assuming users like AI Mode. And that seems to be the case: According to a (small) survey done by Oppenheimer & Co., 82% of searchers find AI Mode more helpful than Google Search, while 75% find it more helpful than ChatGPT (I wonder why). [5] Nothing shows fear more than copying a challenger’s user interface and abandoning the cash machine that worked for 20 years. AI Mode is basically ChatGPT with a Google logo. Google follows the Meta playbook, which fenced in Snapchat’s and TikTok’s growth by copying their core features. And most alarmingly for search marketers, AI Mode eats clicks for breakfast. Research by iPullrank found that “4.5% of AI Mode Sessions result in a click.”[6] A click. As in one! But Google cannot afford to lose the investor narrative. I personally believe that AI Mode won’t launch before Google has figured out the monetization model. And I predict that searchers will see way fewer ads but much better ones, and displayed at a better time. Due to the conversational interface and longer prompts, Google should not only have more context about what users really want, but they would also be able to better estimate when is the best time to show an ad during the chat conversation. As a result, I expect CPCs will skyrocket, but CPAs will become more efficient. Between AI Mode, AI Overviews, and ChatGPT stands this important question: How much can we influence answers, and how different is that job from what we’ve done in SEO over the last two decades? It’s simple. The tactics are mostly the same, but the ecosystem changes: 1. Longer prompts: The average prompt is 23 words long compared to 4.2 for classic Google Search. [7] The rich detail users provide about their intent hits a content gap that’s tuned for shorthead keywords on the other side of the marketplace. As a result, I see hyper-specialized content that’s fine-tuned for specific personas (see How to Optimize for Topics) in our present and future. 2. SEO winners are not AI winners: If SEO was enough and there was nothing else we needed to do “for AI,” then why aren’t the sites that are most visible in Search the same ones that are visible in LLMs? In Is GEO/AEO the same as SEO?, I found that the lists differ greatly in most verticals. Only highly consolidated spaces with a few winners, like CRM software, have identical winners across both modalities. 3. New intent: Generative: Semrush and Profound came to the conclusion that ~30-70% of intent on LLMs is “generative,” meaning users want to accomplish tasks right then and there. [8] What’s often missed is that while performing an action, e.g., generating an image, the intent can quickly flip to informational or transactional, e.g., learn more about the topic you want to generate the image about or buy icon license. Since experiences are conversational and more continuous, we need to update our model of intent. It doesn’t happen in isolation (think: one session), but several intents can occur during the same session (informational → generative → transactional → informational → etc.). My opinion: It’s too soon to coin a term. Will we switch from Answer Engine Optimization to Agentic Engine Optimization when we enter the Agentic AI age? AI has evolved at a rocket pace over the last 2.5 years, and I don’t expect it will slow down soon. In 2025, LLMs reached the mainstream. We’re not talking about a fringe platform anymore: ChatGPT supposedly receives 2.5 billion prompts a day. With Google seeing over 5 trillion searches per year, you could say ChatGPT has reached about 17.8% of Google’s volume. Keep in mind that a lot of prompts are not searches on ChatGPT, and then the comparison becomes weaker (until Google rolls AI Mode out broadly). [9] Important to note is that LLMs rely on different citation sources to varying degrees. [10] Profound saw in 30 million citations that ChatGPT, AIOs, and Perplexity rely on different citation sources: We know that investing time and resources into non-Google platforms is critical to building trust and visibility across all platforms. But now we know that the mix of platform investment depends on where you want to build visibility. Reddit seems to provide universal impact, which makes sense given their licensing deals with OpenAI and Google, but YouTube, Quora, and review platforms don’t show the same potential for gaining citations on all LLMs. Time also matters. AirOps found that 95% of pages cited in ChatGPT are less than 10 months old. [11] A big reason for this is the training data cutoff for LLMs. New models are still trained on large corpi of data (remember the Google Dance?). Anything newer than the time of training needs to come from the web. As a result, keeping content fresh and continuously iterating seems like a path to AI visibility to me. Even adding the current year to the URL (and meta-title) seems like a good idea. [12] A study by Apple, which I covered in the Growth Intelligence Brief, raises a question we might all have at the tip of our tongue: Are LLMs overhyped? [13] The answer: It depends … on the complexity of the task: LLMs are smart but still struggle with complex tasks. Good news for tech workers … right? And here’s another thing: With the increase of LLM use and adoption, how will we measure success for our optimization efforts? I ran a survey of Growth Memo in June, and it’s clear our industry hasn’t really nailed how we measure the LLM visibility of our brands. Out of those who responded, about 30% are using traditional SEO tools to measure LLM visibility, 26% are using Google Analytics 4 traffic signals, and a whopping 21% aren’t measuring yet and need help determining how. And the biggest surprise is this: Overwhelmingly, we don’t trust our LLM visibility measurements. Close to 80% of survey respondents don’t believe the way they are measuring LLM visibility is accurate. A big topic in the whole LLM conversation is, of course, whether AI replaces white collar workers or not. I’m including this discussion in my halftime report because I’m seeing a growing number of in-house experts who are afraid to be replaced. Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, wrote a public memo, saying the company would need fewer people because of AI (bolded text is mine): “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” [14] Amazon has cut +27,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, but has never had more employees at the end of 2024, except for at the end of 2021 by a small margin. [15] Other tech companies pulled even: But is AI really replacing white collar workers, or is it used for good PR? Layoff tracker, layoffs.fyi, shows that the number of companies and employees laid off is not growing since the pandemic. A jobs report by CompTIA shows that while tech employment is slightly down between June 2023 and June 2025…[18] …the number of job openings with AI skills far outpaces the number of listings for all roles. In other words, “AI layoffs” seem more PR play or justification for job cuts. But upskilling with AI is critical. The landmark lawsuit against Google for being an online search monopoly concludes by Labor Day (September 1). The DoJ asks for: Google, on the other hand, agrees to end exclusive agreements, so we know Google and Apple will divorce, but opposes a Chrome divestiture and data sharing mandates. The remedy ruling could have significant implications on the AI race, and where marketers should place their money. For example, a Chrome divestiture could significantly set Google back, as OpenAI and Perplexity launch their own browsers. It would also mean a material loss in user behavior data and agentic AI capabilities. Losing the exclusive agreement with Apple could also mean that more users set other browsers than Chrome as default, if they can provide a strong benefit. However, I personally think the most realistic outcome is a forced end to exclusive agreements and would be shocked to see a Chrome divestiture. For context: The second half of 2025 will likely be defined by adaptation rather than resistance. Companies that succeed will be those that foster trust beyond Google, build direct audience relationships, and upskill teams in AI.

Title: Could AI Kill Off Hollywood’s Talent Pipeline?

Time Published: 2025-07-29T13:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Many top-tier directors and producers came into the business by doing the grunt work that AI may soon handle As writer Van Robichaux puts it, he only has an agent because an assistant read one of his scripts, liked it and flagged the right person. That assistant went on to become a producer on the Oscar-nominated “The Brutalist.” He got his start, like many executives in Hollywood, reviewing scripts and passing them to higher-level decision makers, according to Robichaux, who declined to name the person. But as the presence of artificial intelligence expands throughout the industry, low-level jobs like a script reader will be among the first to disappear. “Would his job even exist if they didn’t need assistants reading all the screenplays coming over the transom?” Robichaux said in an AI roundtable hosted by WrapPRO last week. “If his job doesn’t exist, does he not become a producer and does ‘The Brutalist’ not get made? “Worst of all, would I have a career?” The hypothetical question posed by Robichaux, who has written episodes of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and is writing the “Wedding Crashers” sequel, has a firm basis in reality, with AI promising to handle a lot of the lower-level grunt work for everyone. It’s happening faster than you think, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei telling Axios that he expects the technology to wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs over the next one to five years (although he wouldn’t be the first tech executive to make overly aggressive predictions). But what’s less discussed is the consequence of losing some or even all of those entry-level jobs, whose real value lies in bringing in young talent and educating them about the business from the ground up. That kind of institutional knowledge is invaluable in a field as complicated and politically fraught as entertainment, and the industry risks losing what is essentially a training ground for the next-generation of decision makers. “It does create a pipeline problem,” Robichaux said. “Every single major Hollywood producer started with a low-level industry job that is going away.” In India, thousands of people grow up aspiring to work for consumer goods giant Unilever. Once hired, the company sends that new hire to a rural community to sell soap, according to Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at research firm Gartner. That’s because the company wants the employee to understand how consumers buy their products and how price sensitivity actually works in the real world. It’s a practical example of the kind of institutional knowledge a person gains when doing entry-level work as they work their way up the ranks of their field, and isn’t different from the kind of skills, hacks and short-hand communication you pick up on the set of a film or show. But what happens to that experience when AI starts to replace these positions? There’s the risk that short-term gain in reduced costs may come at the expense of talent with the necessary critical thinking skills to lead down the line. “We would lose some of that lower-level tacit knowledge, which is important for higher-level decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. Talent agencies, for instance, start trainees in the mailroom, having them progress as assistants handling administrative tasks before eventually getting the chance to become an agent. Likewise, script readers and assistants get a chance to absorb nuances of the entertainment business, learning what works and what doesn’t work with audiences as they end up being the producers or writers of the next generation. Losing those positions means one of the more realistic entrances into entertainment is shut off. Getting into Hollywood is already difficult, oftentimes reliant more on who you know vs. what you can do. With fewer opportunities up for grabs, it could just get worse. “AI could accelerate the existing dynamics,” said Brian Justie, a senior research analyst at the UCLA Labor Center. Hollywood has been relatively conservative when it comes to adopting AI, so you can look to the more aggressive tech industry as a bellwether for the impact of the technology. It’s nothing short of brutal. The total tally of layoffs in the tech industry has exceeded 100,000 this year, according to a count conducted by The Bridge Chronicle. That’s been led by big cuts from Microsoft, Meta, Intel and others. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in April said up to 30% of his company’s code is now written by AI; over the next three months, his company laid off 15,000 employees. Google was willing to spend $2.4 billion to hire a CEO and a few engineers because their AI expertise was specifically focused on programming to replace coders. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees, “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” While the entertainment industry may not follow tech’s playbook to a tee, it’s not a stretch to see the allure of cutting costs inspiring similar moves. Advancements in AI capabilities around VFX could potentially see layoffs in that area alone. Not everyone thinks the end of grunt work for a new hire spells doom for the industry. Scott Mann, founder and co-CEO of Flawless AI, a post-production visual effects company, said AI could potentially change what an entry-level position looks like. Traditionally, it’s incredibly difficult to jump into a position where you’re directing or writing a film. But AI tools will eventually make it easier to craft films from the get go, said Mann, who was also on the WrapPRO AI roundtable. You’re already seeing it with creators, with tools provided by the likes of YouTube and TikTok enabling more polished videos. “It’s scary because it’s not what we know,” he said. “But it changes what ‘entry-level’ could look like.” Hannah Elsakr, vice president of global GenAI new business ventures at Adobe, echoed the sentiment, noting that new hires may enter at a different level without the grunt work. She added that it’s happening with coders, and that the more sophisticated work required, whether it’s creative or coding, may help companies identify the “real gems” earlier, allowing them to advance faster. It’s also unclear if AI will actually replace all of these tasks. While the technology has made huge leaps over the last three years, there remain limitations, particularly on the creative side. Justie warned that AI won’t have the same impact across all jobs. It’s clear there’s a shift happening with increasing comfort in relying on AI and bots to handle tasks for us. But what happens if that institutional knowledge built up over experience and grunt work goes away? “The risk is we become so dependent on AI, when we have a catastrophic element that AI doesn’t foresee, we can’t make decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. And if Hollywood is anything, it’s unpredictable and, at times, even catastrophic.

Title: Trump’s tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/29/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-impact/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T12:52:41Z

By JOSH BOAK and PAUL WISEMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’” he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.”

Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn't blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. Trump says no inflation from tariffs, but businesses see higher prices The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Keeping the economy on a knife's edge Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’'' he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people.

Title: Tariffs could squeeze US factories, boost costs by up to 4.5%, new analysis finds

A new analysis suggests President Donald Trump's tariffs could increase factory costs by 2% to 4.5% WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants" if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump's policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there's the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow" show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn't say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop ‘Can Be A Tough Place To Work,’ But Its Vision Is Clear, A New Biography Claims: ‘It’s All About Gwyneth’

ByRachel Burchfield ByRachel Burchfield, Contributor. Love her or hate her—when it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s difficult to look away. This has led to the popularity of Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop, since its creation in 2008 as a newsletter written from her kitchen table—and that public fascination has now led to the writing of journalist Amy Odell’s new book Gwyneth: The Biography, out July 29. Odell tells me over Zoom that she spent three years interviewing more than 220 people who knew Paltrow at different stages of her life—ranging from friends to those who worked with her on movie sets to those who worked with her at Goop—“and I wanted to pull back the curtain on how she became so famous and so polarizing,” she says. “She’s someone people are magnetically attracted to, but she’s also been super controversial, and that’s what I think the book does, is really tell that story and also explain how she impacted various industries—entertainment, obviously, but also fashion, beauty and, perhaps most significantly, wellness.” All of Paltrow’s life experiences—from being a 1990s “It Girl” and winning the Academy Award for Best Actress at just 26 years old to being raised as the privileged daughter of Bruce Paltrow and Blythe Danner (as Odell reminds me, “I mean, Steven Spielberg is her godfather”) and so much in between—led to the creation of Goop 17 years ago and its trajectory ever since. While Odell’s book covers so much more than Goop—from her high-profile relationships to her childhood to her acting career—it also leans heavily into Paltrow as an entrepreneur. “She seems really ambitious,” Odell tells me. “She obviously juggles a lot of things capably.” She’s authentic, she adds, and “was never shy about just being who she is. This is all she knows. So I think that really works in her favor.” It’s nearly impossible to separate Paltrow the businesswoman from Paltrow the woman, and Gwyneth paints a holistic portrait of the 52-year-old’s life. Of Goop, Odell says, “Gwyneth made it very appealing through her taste—her really good taste—and she made it a world that people wanted to be a part of.” At the office, Paltrow is known mostly as “GP”; she often rolls up to the Goop offices—wearing, of course, Goop’s G. Label clothing line—and parks her white Range Rover in a spot labeled “Reserved for G-Spot.” As a boss, “Some people find it to be quite challenging,” Odell says of Paltrow. “But I think the good thing about working for her is that her vision is very clear. She has this extraordinary taste—a really sophisticated aesthetic and aspirational aesthetic that she brought to the wellness industry. I think that’s, in part, what made Goop and Goop’s wellness content so appealing. It was this gorgeous, aspirational aesthetic she brought to it.” Right down to the company’s name, Paltrow is in the midst of it—Goop was chosen as a moniker because of Paltrow’s initials, GP, and the perceived fact that companies with double Os—think Google or Yahoo!—did well. According to Odell’s book, Paltrow initially thought the name was “stupid and funny,” and she has also said in the past that Goop was “an old nickname” (her father, Bruce, apparently used to call her “Goopie”). True to Paltrow’s authentic nature, two Miramax executives told Odell that they remembered Paltrow using a Goop@aol.com email address back in the 1990s. She is who she is. As a boss—Paltrow has served as CEO of Goop since 2016, eight years after founding it—she has “very strong ideas and a very clear vision,” Odell says. “The problem is, she wanted to do everything, and she wanted to do it all perfectly.” Paltrow, known as a perfectionist, has also seen Goop spread itself rather thin—from beauty to fashion to wellness to food to newsletters to podcasts to Netflix shows, there are few verticals that the company hasn’t touched. “So people felt overworked, and there wasn’t a lot of money for everything they were doing—some people felt like they didn’t have enough budget for freelancers and things like that,” Odell says. “So there’s a lot of work to be done, and there’s this perfectionism that she wants to achieve. So people felt pressure from that.” If you walk into Paltrow’s office, she wants you to get directly to the point, Odell says, and “then you could just go.” When Paltrow shines her light on someone, “it feels amazing and people really thrive, but there’s a fear that it’s going to be taken away,” Odell tells me. If it does get taken away, in comes the stress, and “that stress could just permeate the office environment.” Some, Odell says, called Paltrow “icy and cold and aloof,” drawing comparisons to Vogue’s departing editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, whom Odell also profiled in a 2022 biography. “I think it can be a tough place to work,” Odell says. “That said—[it’s] not for everybody. Some people found it to be really tough. Some people ignored the chaos and were fine, and people said they liked that the vision was very clear, which was that it’s Gwyneth. It’s all about Gwyneth.” Much like when Paltrow shines her light on an employee and they feel her warmth, so it is when Paltrow promotes Goop’s products—that’s when they do the best. “They do sell,” Odell says. “People want to buy what she’s wearing. She looks great in the clothes, and she looks great wearing the mascara. So she’s very powerful in that way. But what if she gets tired of it? People tell me she doesn’t love doing the social media content—not that I can blame her. She’s got a lot on her plate.” Goop came about when Paltrow was living in London with her ex-husband Chris Martin and their two young kids: Apple, born in 2004, and Moses, born in 2006. After becoming a mother, Paltrow dialed back her work as an actress, which seems to be revving up again after both kids have now gone away to college. That leaves questions about the future of Goop—after all, what is Goop without Paltrow? “I’m not saying Gwyneth is not there for the company, but if she changes her mind—so the investors I spoke to, they did not see a super bright future for Goop, I have to say,” Odell says. Before Goop, Paltrow threw her star power behind brands like American Express and Estée Lauder before she realized, “Hey, why am I using my image to promote these other brands when I can use it to build my own brand?” Odell says of Paltrow’s possible thought patterns during that time period. “Which is incredibly savvy. And I think, in that way, she’s like the original influencer, because she realized that she could use her image to drive purchases, and she did really early affiliate deals before anyone was calling them affiliate deals, and now affiliate deals are this huge industry.” “I think she’s been so strategic,” Odell tells me. Since its newsletter origins, it has focused on the aforementioned beauty (Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop), fashion (G. Label), wellness (Goop Wellness) and food (Goop Kitchen) verticals; it has had a Netflix series, a podcast, dipped its toe into home furnishings and courted controversy for its perceived pseudoscience and boundary-pushing products, like a viral candle advertised as smelling like Paltrow’s orgasm. Many people told Odell that Goop has spread itself too thin, “that they did too much,” she says. “They raised a lot of money, too. One expert I talked to said they probably never should have raised that much money.” Odell’s many interviews led her to believe that “they can keep going probably for a very long time, just as they are today,” she says. “I think it’s probably really up to Gwyneth—do I want to keep doing this? Do I want to have a little bit more flexibility and maybe license more of this business? I think it’s really up to her.” In September 2024, Goop let go 18 percent of its staff—affecting about 40 people—followed by a second round of layoffs last November. The goal of the reduction is to “optimize operational efficiency and revenue growth in our key verticals of beauty and fashion,” a Goop spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson declined to provide specific revenue figures, but said revenue grew year-over-year in 2023 and was on track to grow again in 2024. While the spokesperson declined to say if Goop—a privately-held company—is profitable, Business Insider did report in November that Goop Beauty revenue was up 21 percent over the year prior, and the fashion brand G. Label was up 45 percent. The outlet reported that Goop has raised more than $140 million and was most recently valued at $433 million (per PitchBook); last fall, Paltrow told WWD that, after the first round of layoffs, Goop was “back in growth mode.” “What I’m most excited about is the refining of the brand that we’re doing—our hyperfocus on beauty, fashion and food,” Paltrow told Fortune in March. “Those are the verticals where we’re seeing incredible product-market fit and margin. Food, beauty and G. Label all grew exponentially last year. Since COVID, we’ve had to stay so agile, and getting to the other side of that and focusing on our strengths—there’s power in that.” Paltrow called layoffs “painful” and told the publication that “it’s always a very difficult thing to do, but sometimes for the rigor of the business, it’s necessary.” “I hate doing that more than anything in the world,” she continued, adding that Goop was “very, very close” to being profitable, “which is incredibly exciting, and a big milestone.” Not bad for a newsletter sharing recipes and recommendations with no monetization strategy in place in the company’s early days. Back then, Odell writes, “the whole spectacle of Goop was just plain entertaining, like a very curated look into her life.” Speaking of a look into her life—and into Paltrow’s influence—after she announced in 2014 that she and Martin were separating after 10 years of marriage, famously calling it a “conscious uncoupling,” Goop.com “received so much traffic, the site crashed,” Odell writes. As the company monetized and got into e-commerce, “I didn’t understand anything,” Paltrow said, as quoted in Gwyneth. “I didn’t finish college. I didn’t go to business school. I didn’t go up through a corporate environment.” Going forward, as Paltrow said herself, Goop’s strategy is to niche down on beauty, fashion and food: “The best thing to do is just embrace your niche, and scale can come from that,” Paltrow said at the 2024 Forbes Power Women’s Summit. “A lot of mistakes have come from me not understanding that.” “We have a lot of intention around what we’re doing, and I’m proud that we’re still alive and kicking,” she added. If Goop could go back in time, it should have done this from the start, Odell tells me. “People I talked to said she might’ve been better off just trying to prove one vertical first—just do beauty and kill it in beauty, and then maybe you iterate from there,” she says, citing Kim Kardashian’s Skims and its commitment to shapewear as an example. While Skims was founded by Kardashian, it’s not all about Kardashian, “and that makes you stronger, I think, as a celebrity brand,” Odell says. With Goop, “I think what happened there—this is my informed view on it—is that they built out all those different businesses, the clothing, the beauty, the events, all of that,” Odell says. “And they just grew too big. It was just too expensive to do all of that, a lot to build out a staff, to do a beauty line, to do a clothing line, a staff to do content. So they cut back because they needed to. The expenses were just too high.” As Odell writes in Gwyneth, “Not only was the pace and breadth of work unsustainable for employees, it would also prove unsustainable for Goop.” “[But] they’re still there and the company’s still going,” Odell tells me. “And Gwyneth is still the CEO.” These days, Odell was told the Goop Kitchen is the company’s biggest moneymaker—hence food making the cut alongside beauty and fashion as the path forward. When asked about a possible exit someday, Paltrow told Fortune, “I’m in building mode and not thinking about an exit right now. I don’t even really want to think about it for another three years, or even start thinking about it.” It remains uncertain what will come of Goop, but what Odell knows? “Whatever happens with Goop, Gwyneth will be fine,” she writes in the book. “She has a way of emerging victorious from any calamity.” Goop’s success, in large part, boils down to Paltrow and the public’s inability to take its eyes off her, a woman who Odell writes possesses “an enduring level of status and fascination few ever achieve.” “Goop was a window into a certain elitism,” she continues in the book. “And people couldn’t look away.” To a degree, they still can’t.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: What the techno-feudalism prophets get wrong

‘Cloudalists’ and digital serfs: capitalism’s new disguise? Capitalism isn’t dead, though many are rushing to write its obituary. It’s alive and kicking, powered by AI, vast data centres – and multi-billion dollar infrastructure investment. From Paris to Madrid, Rome to Berlin, a medieval spectre haunts the European left, and it’s wearing a Silicon Valley hoodie – ‘techno-feudalism’. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, de facto leader of French leftwing party La France Insoumise, has called for a tax on the profits of what he calls our new ‘digital lords’. Yet the same Mélenchon also tweets that ‘AI is not external to capitalist reality: it inscribes itself in a techno-feudalism where a few actors capture the rent.’ Profits or rent? Capitalism or feudalism? Like some stray Schrödinger’s Cat wandering the streets of Palo Alto, Mélenchon’s economy exists in two states simultaneously – dead and alive, capitalist and feudal, depending on which rhetorical convenience opens the box. In Spain, deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz rails against ‘the techno-feudalism of magnate Elon Musk’, warning that tech billionaires want to transform ‘democracies into corporate monarchies’. Italy’s Green leader Angelo Bonelli accuses that same billionaire of erecting ‘an autocratic neo-feudalism’, urging the country to choose ‘Musk or democracy’. This outbreak of techno-feudal theatrics is hilariously mistimed, arriving in the middle of the most obscene, AI-fuelled capitalist orgy since the Gilded Age. During Trump’s Gulf tour in May 2025, he secured massive US-bound investments – Saudi Arabia committed $600bn, Qatar $1.2tn and the UAE $1.4tn, with much of it (if it ever materialises) earmarked for AI infrastructure. (This is on top of $1tn Japan promised back in February.) When OpenAI’s Sam Altman floated his $7tn fundraising fantasy last year, it felt like performance art. Now it looks more like a distinct lack of ambition. This AI spending tsunami has engulfed all of Big Tech: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone are injecting $320bn into AI infrastructure in 2025, up from $246bn last year. Oracle signed $48bn in new contracts in a single quarter.

July 28, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine

Time Published: 2025-07-28T12:45:58Z
Full Content:
DevOps.com Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine By: Alan Shimel on July 28, 2025 We may have just witnessed the closing of one of the most iconic chapters in modern tech. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently stated that the company is transforming from a “software factory” into an “intelligence engine.” This came on the heels of another round of layoffs — with now over 7% of Microsoft’s workforce having been laid off recently — even as the company continues to report strong earnings. The implications of Nadella’s statement are far more profound than just a catchy metaphor for AI adoption. This may be the official end of the era Marc Andreessen launched when he declared “software is eating the world” and anointed every company a “software company.” Well, here we are. The world has been thoroughly chewed up and digested by software. Mission accomplished. Now what? We’re entering a new epoch — one where the core differentiator isn’t your software, it’s your intelligence. Not just artificial intelligence, but your organization’s ability to harness data, interpret it in real time, and act — autonomously, contextually and continuously. The software itself, once the crown jewel of digital transformation, is on the verge of being commoditized by the very intelligence it enabled. Why? Because increasingly, AI is writing the software. GitHub Copilot. Google Gemini Code Assist. Meta’s Code Llama. Even legacy enterprise players are integrating generative AI tooling to auto-generate workflows, scripts, tests and documentation. When AI can write, test, optimize and deploy software faster and better than a team of engineers, you start to ask: Is the code really the product, or is the intelligence behind it what actually matters? The answer is becoming clear. Software is no longer the endgame — it’s the delivery vehicle for intelligence. This transformation won’t just tweak job descriptions or shift a few budget lines. It’s going to shake corporate foundations like a 9.0 mega-quake. If your business model depends on proprietary code, you’re in trouble. If your engineering team is still grinding through feature requests by hand while your competitor has deployed autonomous agents to build, test and launch new capabilities in hours — game over. For large enterprises, the shift to intelligence engines means reorganizing around knowledge, not departments. Data pipelines will matter more than dev pipelines. Insight velocity will matter more than release velocity. The companies that succeed will be the ones that can build, refine, and deploy intelligence continuously — not just quarterly software updates. For SMBs, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. AI-enabled tools are leveling the playing field in a way we haven’t seen since the rise of cloud computing. A five-person startup can now compete with a Fortune 500 in terms of feature velocity, user experience and even customer support. Intelligence, not size, will be the ultimate force multiplier. And for the much-prophesied “one-person company” — yes, the age is dawning. With agentic AI handling coding, marketing, legal review, customer service and data analysis, a solopreneur can run a digitally native, globally available business without hiring a single employee. This isn’t just about flipping a switch or adding “AI” to your quarterly roadmap. Becoming an intelligence engine is a deliberate journey — and there are signs that mark the way: 1. Data-first mindset: Intelligence engines treat data as the core asset. They prioritize collecting high-quality, domain-specific data, and build the infrastructure to pipeline, label, refine and retrieve it for machine learning and decision automation. 2. Agentic workflows: Static automation is out. Dynamic, self-improving workflows powered by autonomous agents are in. These agents don’t just execute — they learn, adapt and optimize. 3. Continuous intelligence delivery: Think CI/CD, but for insights. Intelligence engines ship insights to decision-makers and operational systems on a real-time basis. 4. Synthetic workforce: Human labor is augmented—or even replaced—by synthetic workers: AI agents, copilots, bots and LLMs embedded into every facet of the business. 5. Organizational un-siloing: The intelligence engine operates horizontally across functions. Sales, marketing, ops and IT share a common data and intelligence backbone. Let’s be clear: software factories delivered immense value. But they were always limited by human throughput. Intelligence engines are unbounded by those constraints. An intelligence engine doesn’t just launch a product; it learns from the market response in real time and updates pricing, targeting, messaging, and UX on the fly. It doesn’t need a quarterly planning meeting to shift direction — it sees signals in the data and pivots autonomously. It doesn’t just automate workflows; it optimizes outcomes based on multidimensional, real-time feedback. The compounding advantage of this model is hard to overstate. Companies that reach intelligence engine status will move faster, serve smarter, and scale leaner than anything we’ve seen before. We’re already seeing the early adopters — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta — aligning their entire business models around intelligence-first infrastructure. But you don’t need hyperscaler resources to join the club. Thanks to open-source LLMs, accessible vector databases, and SaaS AI copilots, the tools are in reach for nearly everyone. The next 12–24 months will separate the true transformers from the late-stage digital dinosaurs. The tipping point will come when intelligence engines can fully replace not just manual workflows, but decision-making at scale. If you’re a technology leader, you need to ask yourself: Are we still building software factories when we should be engineering intelligence? This doesn’t mean gutting your dev team or replacing your engineers with bots overnight. But it does mean evolving your architecture, culture and processes to put intelligence — not just functionality — at the center of your strategy. At Techstrong, we’ll be watching this trend unfold across all our platforms — DevOps.com, Security Boulevard, Cloud Native Now, Platform Engineering,Digital CxO, and of course, Techstrong.ai. We’ll bring you the stories, strategies and signals of the companies making the leap from factory floor to intelligence engine. Software may have eaten the world — but intelligence is about to rewrite the recipe. Stay tuned.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Looking to invest $10,000? Here's where you can put that cash right now, according to six Wall Street veterans. On the agenda today: But first: How do they do it? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Ever wonder how the world's most accomplished business leaders make it all look so effortless? How do they conquer jam-packed calendars, build empires, and still find time to fly helicopters or sip matcha in peace? Welcome to Power Hours, a fresh Business Insider series that peels back the curtain on the daily routines of top CEOs, founders, and creative visionaries. We're going deep on what makes these high performers tick — and how you can apply their secrets to your own life. We've gone behind the scenes with leaders like Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab, who starts his day before sunrise, ruthlessly cuts out unnecessary meetings, and flies a helicopter in his spare time. David Risher, CEO of Lyft, winds down with afternoon matcha and occasionally goes undercover as a driver to stay connected to his mission. Here's a snapshot of some of the leaders we've profiled. Each Power Hours profile delivers a dose of inspiration — and a toolkit of takeaways — for readers to better understand how the pros do it all. So, what are your Power Hours? Let us know, we'd love to hear from you! For years, the Spaghett — a mix of cheap beer and Aperol — was known almost exclusively by service industry workers. Now, it's making its way into the spotlight. The Spaghett's rise is also a sign that the economy is on the edge of disaster. It's a lot cheaper than other cocktails and easy to make at home — a standout choice for when you feel pressure on your wallet. No frills, great flavor. The silver lining of mass layoffs is that no one has to go through it alone. From former Big Tech workers to laid-off federal employees, old coworkers are banding together on networks like Slack and Signal. In their private channels, laid-off workers offer each other more than just emotional support. They're helping each other navigate the confusing administrative tasks that come with being fired, sharing job postings, and engaging in mock interviews. Experts say it reflects a surge in worker resistance. Secretive investors are betting big on the next homebuilding boom. Known as "land bankers," these investors are scooping up construction-ready real estate and waiting until builders are ready to put shovels in the ground. The result would be a more reliable homebuilding machine and even cheaper homes. That's great news for homebuyers in the near future. A new breed of land barons. Big Tech companies and startups are racing to dominate the next frontier of AI, and they're shelling out top dollar to the limited pool of tech talent who will join them. BI pulled federal filings from some of the top AI startups valued at over $2 billion. Companies like OpenAI are dangling mid-six-figure salaries amid the war for talent. What 13 startups are paying.

Title: Inside the Private Equity Scam—and the Livelihoods It Has Destroyed

Time Published: 2025-07-27T10:00:00Z

In 2019, when I was working what I have grudgingly come to accept may be one of the best jobs I’ll ever have, my employer, Gizmodo Media Group, was acquired by a private equity firm called Great Hill Partners. Private equity had not shown itself to be a great friend of journalism: Alden Global Capital, another firm, had just gutted the Pulitzer Prize–winning Denver Post. Still, my colleagues and I on the company’s investigative team were cautiously optimistic about the new management, personified by our new CEO, an executive named Jim Spanfeller, who had previously run Forbes’s digital arm. Following a rough few years, an infusion of cash seemed like it could be a good thing. Our soft skepticism, it turns out, was disastrously naïve. Within days of the sale, both of my editors had been fired by people who did not appear to know they had direct reports, leaving my team to collect paychecks without any actual work to do—a particularly comical hit, given the firm’s alleged goal to eradicate waste. Out of a sense of duty, most of us assigned ourselves to other sites within the company. But the new management insisted we replace much of our reporting with slideshows to artificially inflate our audience. Invasive, auto-playing ads became such a problem that we fielded constant complaints from our readers. Our product and sales teams disappeared. People routinely left meetings frazzled and burdened by bizarre mandates with little data to back them up. I stuck it out for a while; I truly adored my job reporting alongside people who alternately delighted and intimidated me, journalists I had admired for years. I finally made the decision to quit when management rewrote a sensitive story, entirely fabricating key details, and tried to pass the work off as my own. It wasn’t just that the company was being run poorly, or that Great Hill was trying to squeeze every last penny out of our labor. It was that the people in charge seemed actively hostile to our attempts to do good, ethical, even profitable work. No one is going to visit a website they can’t trust or even use. I’m not a businessman, but a libel lawsuit seems bad for the bottom line. And there was something almost hallucinatory about working under people with such a vague grasp of our corner of the industry, who were so deeply incurious about the work that went into the brands they were allegedly trying to save. Meanwhile, across the office, the journalist Megan Greenwell was struggling with a much higher-profile version of this conundrum. As was extensively reported in the New York media press, Greenwell, then the editor in chief of the anarchic and beloved sports site Deadspin, publicly resigned four months after Great Hill purchased our company. “The tragedy of digital media isn’t that it’s run by ruthless, profiteering guys in ill-fitting suits,” she wrote in an eviscerating blog post announcing her departure. “It’s that the people posing as experts know less about how to make money than their employees, to whom they won’t listen.” Greenwell’s entire staff followed her lead shortly after, mass quitting largely in protest of a mandate to abandon higher-traffic stories about politics and internet oddities (and irreverent classics like “my enemies in nature, ranked”) to focus entirely on sports. In the years since, the Deadspin story has become something of a parable about media and private equity and the ultimate value of those guys in the ill-fitting suits. Following the resignation, a number of former Deadspin writers launched Defector, a worker-owned publication that claimed 40,000 paid subscribers as of last year. And, as Greenwell writes in Bad Company, her wide-ranging account of private equity’s impact on American life, over a period of less than five years, Great Hill executives ran Deadspin so far into the ground that it “draws slightly less traffic than a Pennsylvania dog breeder called greenfieldpuppies.com.” Last spring, the remaining writers were laid off and the brand sold to a Maltese company with plans to feature “gambling content” on the site. Almost all of the 12 websites that Great Hill originally purchased have been auctioned off in severely depleted states. This July, Spanfeller announced that G/O Media (as the collection of sites was rebranded) was “working towards a full wind down,” noting “we will exit having increased shareholder value.” Years later, I still acutely remember the shock of watching a few guys armed with little more than inspirational quotes turn a functional if imperfect company into a series of spammy content farms. “Making it difficult to know what’s going on is exactly the point of so much about how private equity operates,” argues Greenwell in Bad Company. She follows four people in disparate industries—retail, health care, journalism, and housing—trying, as we did at Gizmodo Media, to understand why people claiming to revitalize our companies did exactly the opposite. For people who genuinely desire functional, vibrant institutions, funds like Great Hill can represent not just a logistical but an emotional challenge. It’s not easy to watch something you depend on, and spent countless hours analyzing and agonizing over, systematically stripped for parts. Greenwell’s book seeks to answer the questions many people at the receiving end of a private equity takeover want to know: Who are these people, how did they get here, and what on Earth do they actually want? Ostensibly, private equity firms flip underperforming private companies kind of like houses: The firms raise capital to buy “distressed assets” wholesale, take out (often massive) loans to cover a rehabilitation job, and pay their investors when the business either goes public or is sold. Greenwell locates the origin of these leveraged buyout arrangements in the “bootstrap deals” of the 1960s, when financial firms took on companies that were successful but too small to go public. Within a decade, opportunistic executives started targeting larger companies. By the ’80s, hostile takeovers of Fortune 500 companies became common, if not exactly the norm. Today’s private equity landscape is vast: Once you’re attuned to the industry’s hold on nearly every aspect of American life, it feels impossible to escape. My local grocery, an iconic New York institution once owned by a family that pledged to hire union-represented locals and maintain the lowest prices in the city, was sold in 2020 to a national chain after a takeover from Sterling Investment Partners. On my beat, covering the health care industry, I was regularly confronted with the realities of staffing shortages and closures stemming in part from private equity firms’ attempts to bring budgets down to cover their debt. And I saw private equity’s obsession with becoming “agile” and “lean” reflected in the way the Department of Government Efficiency has deliriously hacked away at programs it has neither the capacity nor the will to understand. As recounted in Greenwell’s book, stories like these aren’t simply anecdotal. Private equity’s influence on the economy, and our livelihoods, is significant. Twelve million Americans, she writes, work for companies that are owned by private equity. The industry operates 8 percent of private hospitals, four out of five of the largest for-profit day care chains, and currently controls $8.2 trillion in assets—a number that accounts for more than the GDP of any country besides China and the United States. And, where 2 percent of companies go bankrupt within 10 years of their founding, that number jumps to 20 percent when private equity is involved. Between 2009 and 2019, 1.3 million Americans working in retail lost their jobs as a direct result of the industry’s touch. Bad Company offers a few reasons why private equity firms aren’t successfully turning their “distressed assets” around, the most relevant of which is that it pays investors just as well, if not better, to run a company into the ground. (Gordon Gekko’s “Greed is good” speech from the movie Wall Street makes two separate appearances in the book, both entirely appropriate.) Decades of aggressive lobbying and cozy relationships with politicians have favored these firms, which style themselves publicly as “brash swashbucklers, eager to be the hero,” swooping in at their own risk to rescue businesses in distress. But in practice, Greenwell argues, private equity bears vanishingly little risk. And its mandate to not just profit but maximize shareholder value has the effect of abstracting critical industries to a point where, the author writes, “a company doesn’t even need to exist at all.” If reducing the quality of service, selling off real estate, and collecting fees are more profitable than running a successful business, argues Greenwell, “liquidation is not just the best option, but indeed the only one.” Today, when a private equity firm borrows money to “save” a company, the debt is almost always carried not by the firms that purchased a company, but by the company itself. Standard takeover deals include what’s known as a 2-and-20 clause: Funds take a 2 percent management fee of all assets under their control, as well as 20 percent of all profits above a certain threshold. This is in addition, writes Greenwell, to a range of other common payouts, including monitoring and transaction fees. As one team of researchers found over a decade ago, as much as two-thirds of a private equity firm’s profits typically come from these kinds of management fees. Many deploy sale-leaseback arrangements to make a quick buck, selling off property and requiring acquired companies to pay rent on real estate they once owned. And then there are classic cost-saving measures like mass layoffs. “Taken together,” Greenwell writes, “it is very, very difficult for private equity to lose money.” In this context, whether a company provides anything of value beyond dividends to investors is somewhat beside the point. Private equity’s central conceit is that financiers, not skilled workers or industry experts, are best positioned to figure out what makes any given business work. In her reporting, Greenwell makes a detailed argument for the fundamental misguidedness of this stance. Many private equity managers don’t know very much at all about the businesses they run. They’re experts in markets, not trades. So it’s no wonder they hop from industry to industry deploying the same tactics, cutting jobs and saddling companies with debt and inking extractive real estate deals. Hospitals, newspapers, rental apartments, and toy stores have wildly different business models. But to a private equity firm, they’re all the same. Over the course of Bad Company, Greenwell follows four people whose lives have been altered by a private equity takeover. The history and policy analysis act as a scaffolding for these stories; it’s in these intimate portraits that the book truly shines. Though never stated outright, the experiences of Greenwell’s subjects act as a powerful foil to a certain kind of managerial thinking that is implicit at the heart of private equity’s pitch: that profits could only possibly matter to the people in charge of the ledgers, that employees need to be micromanaged, that businesses suffer because of a lack of commitment from the people who clock in and out every day. In other words, Greenwell managed to find a collection of characters utterly devoted to what they do. Liz, an Alaskan mother trying to lift her family out of chronic instability, worked for the retail giant Toys “R” Us, which declared bankruptcy and axed 33,000 employees without severance when private equity–imposed debt made it impossible to keep shelves stocked. Liz loved working at Toys “R” Us so much that she got a tattoo of the company’s signature giraffe. As recounted by Greenwell, after a particularly satisfying customer service experience, a pair of new parents gave their baby her name. A physician named Roger abandoned a cushy job decades ago to practice medicine in rural Wyoming. Now in his eighties and retired, he reflects on his battle to maintain essential medical services, like maternity care, following a series of acquisitions. “You want to leave a place better than you found it,” he tells Greenwell through tears. Natalia, a Texas journalist born in Mexico, ping-ponged between private equity–owned papers, making less than $60,000 a year in Austin and maintaining significant debt to write stories that would resonate with younger, Spanish-speaking audiences. Greenwell also spent time with Loren, a parent whose private equity–backed low-income housing complex flooded, ejecting residents from their homes with no recourse. She is still handing her number out to residents of the building, helping them file complaints from afar. These are not people who need dividends to commit. Throughout Bad Company they find creative ways to circumnavigate the constrictions placed on them by faceless billion-dollar firms. They work longer hours and organize their neighbors. They unionize and campaign. They leverage their tangible connections to their communities to combat people they’ve never met in gleaming Manhattan office towers they’ll never see. In comparison, the copy-paste labor private equity firms perform looks awfully lazy. Intermittently, Bad Company touches on the stories the men in the suits tell one another, and the public, about their critical societal role. “The enduring myth of the lone business genius creating a Fortune 500 company, or saving one from destruction, has benefited private equity immeasurably,” Greenwell writes. She notes that giants of the finance industry like Mitt Romney are rewarded with Senate seats, and that the central branch of the New York Public Library, the MIT computing school, and Yale’s performing arts center all bear the name of Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of Blackstone. The idea that these men are facilitating the process of free-market natural section has contributed to a lack of meaningful regulation—though the donations the private equity industry throws to politicians of both parties certainly don’t hurt. Most memorably, Greenwell describes a Machiavelli quote that once hung in the private conference room of a senior partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the hundred-billion-dollar firm responsible for Toys “R” Us’s leveraged buyout as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of others: “There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its outcome, than to take the lead in introducing a new order of things,” it read. But Greenwell, through her thorough accounting of four companies’ acquisitions and rapid declines, illustrates just how musty that order of things has become, or maybe has always been. Another story the private equity industry likes to tell is that its work is crucial and inevitable, because the companies it acquires suffer from a “failure to thrive” from which there is no turning back. According to this logic, the companies in which Greenwell’s subjects lived and worked were pronounced dead long before funds stepped in to profit from their distress. Toys “R” Us could never survive the shift to e-commerce. Rural hospitals had to consolidate and cut services or face extinction. Declining ad revenue killed journalism. There was simply no other path. But, as Greenwell points out, there are successful retail operations and small hospitals and profitable publications operating in this country today. Many apartment buildings manage to house residents without flooding their apartments or turning off the heat. Extracting every ounce of shareholder value from these companies was far from inevitable—and it’s certainly much harder for an organization to adapt to changing conditions when it’s shedding workers and crippled under a mountain of debt. Of course, it’s impossible to know how any individual company would have fared without private equity’s involvement. Greenwell detours to earlier instances of managerial ineptitude that proved fateful before new ownership stepped in. It could have been in Toys “R” Us’s foolish early deals with Amazon, or the conventional wisdom that underperforming medical centers should slash services, or newspapers’ sluggishness to embrace new models in the digital age. Those were all decisions made by highly paid executives, too. In this sense, Bad Company is a call to bring more creativity and expertise to our country’s critical institutions—to extract them from the hands of people for whom a business isn’t a dynamic entity full of actual people but instead a collection of assets and debts.

Middle managers are the talk of corporate America lately — and Business Insider wants to hear about it. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, alongside major retailers like Walmart, are looking for ways to cut costs and streamline bureaucracy. Enter, the Great Flattening: A widespread wipeout of mid-career jobs. Laid-off managers are pushed into a rocky job market, and those who remain employed are left with an increasing number of direct reports. Millennials and Gen X, who hold most of the US' managerial roles, are most impacted. Check out BI's stories about middle managers: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June he plans to shrink the company's white-collar workforce, citing "efficiency gains." After a round of layoffs, Dell told BI in March that "Through an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company," which will include combining some teams. And, alongside a bout of Meta layoffs in 2023, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that "flatter is faster." "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said. If you are a middle manager — or you report to a middle manager — and are comfortable being interviewed for future reporting, please fill out this quick Google form.
