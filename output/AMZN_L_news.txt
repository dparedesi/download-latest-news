Amazon CEO Andy Jassy delivered a clear message in his recent conversation with CNBC’s Jim Cramer: Artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape Amazon’s workforce, automating routine jobs while creating new opportunities in advanced technology fields. Jassy’s remarks, which echo a memo he sent to Amazon’s 1.5 million employees last month, underscore both the disruptive and transformative potential of generative AI across the company’s operations. Jassy told Cramer that, as with every major technological shift, “there will be fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate.” He emphasized that AI is already freeing Amazon employees from rote work, making jobs “more interesting,” and enabling staff to focus on innovation and higher-value tasks. For example, AI agents now handle coding, analytics, and research at Amazon, he said. However, Jassy was candid about the impact on headcount. He acknowledged that the adoption of generative AI will mean “fewer people” are needed for certain roles. In a recent internal memo, Jassy wrote, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Amazon has already been through significant layoffs, cutting more than 27,000 jobs over the past few years. Jassy positioned the ongoing transformation as an opportunity for those willing to adapt, urging employees to “be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings,” and to experiment with AI tools to “get more done with scrappier teams.” Jassy also pointed out that AI will create new jobs in areas such as robotics, AI development, and other fields requiring human creativity and complex decision-making. “I think that AI and generative AI specifically is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, which is saying a lot, given that we have had the internet,” he told CNBC.

Title: Microsoft dumps thousands of American workers in favor of cheaper foreign techies

By Amanda Bartolotta July 1, 2025 It often begins with a last-minute calendar invite – mandatory, with no explanation. For many workers in the tech industry, this has become a familiar signal. As the video meeting starts, hundreds of employees log in silently. Soon, human resources and legal representatives appear. The message is read. The decision is final. Employees are informed their positions are being eliminated. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! There is no opportunity for dialogue. Years of service are sometimes brought to an end in just a few minutes. Many of these employees had stayed late, worked weekends, mentored new team members and remained committed through difficult cycles. The meeting typically ends with a bland, impersonal, standard statement of appreciation. Executives often describe these actions as necessary for business reasons, with public statements citing over-hiring, inflation, economic uncertainty or the need for cost control. Workers are told the decision is not personal – just business. Still, for those impacted, the effects are significant. Many support families, carry student loans or are primary earners in their households. They return to a job market where opportunities are limited, especially when layoffs affect entire departments or industries at once. What many laid-off employees don’t realize is that the roles they once held may not have been permanently eliminated. Instead, those positions are sometimes quietly reassigned, reclassified or reopened, often without notice or transparency. The reassignment pattern: Layoffs followed by visa hiring While U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a new round expected this week targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut over 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. In its defense, Microsoft claims its 2025 job cuts affect less than 1% of its global workforce. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs. In total, the company filed 14,181 Labor Condition Applications, or LCAs – formal applications required to sponsor foreign workers for temporary employment visas, such as the H-1B – allowing them to work in U.S.-based jobs that are typically held by American workers. This made Microsoft the third-largest filer of foreign labor requests in the U.S., behind only NVIDIA and Amazon. According to U.S. Department of Labor data, nearly 82% of Microsoft’s new foreign workers were tagged at wage levels well below the median salary for those occupations. Howard University professor Ron Hira, a long-time critic of the program, observed that employers frequently pay the minimum they legally have to when utilizing the foreign guest worker program. “Prevailing wages are set far below the market price, inviting employers to exploit the program. The result is that most of the roughly 600,000 H-1B workers are paid below market price. This is an unfair outcome for U.S. and H-1B workers alike: U.S. workers’ wages are undercut and H-1B workers are underpaid.” Hira, author of “Outsourcing America,” co-authored an article documenting why “H-1B wage rules need an overhaul.” In addition to undercutting wages or laying off Americans to bring in more foreign workers, current U.S. law does not require companies to prove they tried to hire Americans first. They also aren’t obligated to notify laid-off employees if the same jobs are reopened through visa programs. Yet these practices are completely legal under existing immigration rules and occur with little oversight, no transparency and no protection for American workers. Strategic shifts The bottom line is that behind every announcement of “strategic realignment” is an American now facing uncertain days ahead, and often with no clear path back. For the American employees on the receiving end of layoff notices, the impact is deeply personal. They’re not just losing a paycheck, they’re losing healthcare, retirement contributions and a sense of security. That’s why Microsoft’s actions, while legal, remain anything but transparent. Most employees aren’t told similar jobs are being filled through H-1B visa requests. For those still employed, the silence only adds to their anxiety. With little information about how decisions are made or who might be next, many are left quietly wondering if they’re just one reorg away from losing everything too. Alongside its growing number of foreign labor filings, Microsoft has continued to expand operations overseas, especially in India. In January 2025, the company announced a $3 billion investment into India’s AI and cloud infrastructure over the next two years, alongside a plan to train 10 million Indian workers in AI-related skills by 2030. While Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees in the United States, the country where the company was founded and still earns the majority of its revenue, executives offered a different message abroad. In January 2025, the company confirmed that no layoffs were planned in India. “For all of India, more jobs are being created,” said Puneet Chandok, president of Microsoft India and South Asia, during a January 2025 interview. As Microsoft expands its commitments to the Indian government and workforce, its 14,181 H-1B visa requests reflect deepening ties with India-based firms. Notably, every single application was filed through Integreon Managed Solutions (INDIA) PVT LTD. This raises serious questions about how many of these roles are being reserved for Indian nationals, especially as American employees are laid off. With little transparency, it becomes increasingly difficult for U.S.-based workers to know whether their jobs are being relocated overseas or quietly filled at the very desks they once occupied. A shifting workforce These trends point to a larger shift in how companies like Microsoft manage their workforce. As layoffs hit U.S.-based employees, the company continues to scale up international hiring, infrastructure and talent development, especially in India. At the same time, the number of H-1B visa filings for foreign workers continues to grow, often for roles very similar to those recently cut in the U.S. All of this remains legal under existing U.S. labor and immigration policies. There are no requirements to prioritize American workers, no obligations to disclose when jobs are offshored and no systems in place to alert laid-off employees that similar roles may be refilled by cheaper foreign workers. For those affected, the result is a widening gap between where tech jobs are created and where they are lost, between American workers being displaced and foreign labor pipelines quietly expanding. What remains to be seen is whether this pattern will continue unchecked, or if policymakers and the public will reevaluate what it means to protect domestic opportunity in a global economy where American companies are increasingly driven by cost-cutting at any price, quiet partnerships and the abandonment of loyalty to their own countrymen.

Title: Kroger announces massive STORE CLOSURES nationwide by 2026, signaling strategic shift

Kroger is closing over 60 underperforming stores (including Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations) across multiple states by 2026, marking one of its largest retractions ever. The closures reflect industry-wide challenges like inflation, competition from Walmart and Aldi, and shifting consumer habits, forcing Kroger to cut costs to remain competitive. Despite minor sales declines (from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year) and a drop in net income, Kroger plans to reinvest savings into customer experience and new store openings in high-growth markets. No layoffs are planned as workers will be offered transfers, but relocations may disrupt employees in rural areas. The UFCW union has not yet raised major objections. Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries.

Kroger is focusing on fresh foods, private labels and digital growth while abandoning weaker markets. Critics question whether reinvestment will offset the loss of community access to groceries. Kroger, one of America's largest grocery chains, is shutting down more than 60 underperforming stores nationwide in a sweeping cost-cutting move. The closures affecting Kroger, Harris Teeter and Pick 'n Save locations mark one of the most significant retractions in the company's history. Stores in Texas, Wisconsin, Georgia, Illinois and several other states will vanish by 2026, with some closing as early as this summer. The decision, announced during Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, comes as the company faces minor sales declines. However, the company insists it will reinvest savings into improving customer experience without layoffs. Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others. Whether this gamble pays off depends on whether reinvestment actually improves service or just shareholder returns. Visit Collapse.newsÂ for more similar stories.

Sources include: DailyMail.co.uk MSN.com USAToday.com Brighteon.com The decision, announced during Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, comes as the company faces minor sales declines. However, the company insists it will reinvest savings into improving customer experience without layoffs. Grocery chains nationwide are grappling with inflation, shifting consumer habits and fierce competition from discount retailers like Walmart and Aldi. Kroger's closures reflect a broader trend in corporate America: Businesses are trimming excess to survive in an uncertain economy. This isn't just about lost stores â it's about the survival tactics of an industry under siege. (Related: Kroger shoppers reporting "a lot of empty shelves" across supermarket chain locations.) Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores, meaning these 60 closures represent roughly two percent of its footprint. While not catastrophic, the move signals a strategic retreat from weaker markets. The first confirmed closures included a location in Dickinson, Texas â with more set to follow between July and October. Wisconsin's affected stores remain unannounced, leaving employees and customers in limbo. Kroger's first-quarter earnings revealed a slight dip. Sales fell from $45.3 billion to $45.1 billion year-over-year, while net income dropped from $962 million to $866 million. Interim CEO Ron Sargent called the results "solid," crediting pharmacy, e-commerce and fresh food sales for keeping the company afloat. Yet the numbers suggest stagnation, forcing Kroger to shed dead weight. No layoffs, but what's next for workers? Kroger insists no jobs will be lost, as employees at closing stores will be offered transfers. But for workers in rural or underserved areas, a nearby store might mean longer commutes or upheaval. For towns losing their only grocery outlet, this is cold comfort. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, representing many Kroger employees, has yet to raise major objections. But the human cost of corporate restructuring remains a quiet concern. Kroger claims savings from closures will fund customer experience upgrades. The company plans to spend up to $3.8 billion this year on new stores and renovations, targeting high-growth markets. This isn't Kroger's first downsizing. In 2018, it closed 40 stores after acquiring Harris Teeter. In 2021, it axed underperforming locations amid pandemic strains. Each time, the company framed cuts as necessary for long-term health. But with inflation squeezing household budgets, customers may see this as another sign of corporate America prioritizing profits over people. Kroger's raised sales forecast hinges on fresh foods, private-label brands and digital services â areas where it competes with Amazon and Walmart. The closure of Kroger Ship, its direct-to-consumer delivery service, suggests even digital strategies face ruthless evaluation. While Kroger refuses to release a full closure list, local reports and union disclosures confirm some casualties. Regardless, the message is clear: growth for some, abandonment for others. Whether this gamble pays off depends on whether reinvestment actually improves service or just shareholder returns. Visit Collapse.newsÂ for more similar stories.

Title: What Happens To Work When AI Does The Easy Parts?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimeuchner/2025/06/30/what-happens-to-work-when-ai-does-the-easy-parts/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T01:43:26Z

ByJim Euchner ByJim Euchner, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A robot using artificial intelligence is displayed at a stand during the International ... More Telecommunication Union (ITU) AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, on May 30, 2024. Humanity is in a race against time to harness the colossal emerging power of artificial intelligence for the good of all, while averting dire risks, a top UN official said. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) A mantra in press releases about generative AI in corporations has been that it will ‘free up people to do more creative work.’ Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, claimed that “AI will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel.” But Microsoft also announced cuts of 6,000 jobs in May, partly attributed to AI automation. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, stated that “Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point… focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about improving customer experiences and inventing new ones.” Amazon has announced 27,000 layoffs since 2022, for some of which AI efficiencies were explicitly cited. Similar patterns exist for other tech firms, including Meta and Duolingo. What’s going on? Is this just a mismatch between PR and the efficiency imperative? Is there any evidence that the jobs are being redesigned for increased creative content, or are we experiencing a straightforward substitution of people for AIs? Perhaps is neither of these, but rather that contradictory messages are natural as executives naviate the fog of transition to a radically new technology. AI certainly has the potential to free people to spend more time on creative tasks. It can create slack time for learning, innovation, or deep thinking about a design. It can also be used to create jobs with broader accountability or a richer work environment. But if any of these is happening, it isn’t being discussed. That is too bad. Businesses could be missing an opportunity, one that goes beyond task automation to rethinking the design of work and technology. They may be missing the chance to take true advantage of the expanding capabilities of generative AI. A narrow focus on efficiency can shift attention away from other important metrics, like customer satisfaction and employee engagement. The irony is that an efficiency mindset might not even maximize efficiency, at least in the long run. In an interview, Patricia Sachs, a workplace anthropologist, told me that "automation mechanizes the way things are supposed to happen. But they almost never happen as expected." The reason is that much work in the real world is invisible, involving workarounds, improvisations, and social networks. As Sachs noted, "none of these appear in the workflow diagram or org chart." This was true at Klarna, a leader in the deployment of generative AI. The company has claimed that AI handles about two-thirds of customer service chats, equivalent to the work of over 700 agents. Their initial results showed, in addition, a drop in resolution times and reduced repeat inquiries, all while maintaining customer satisfaction. But Klarna has started to recruit human agents again, acknowledging that automation led to declines in service quality, customer satisfaction, and trust. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledged that "cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor" in the AI initiative, which led to reductions in quality, morale and trust. The company is now hiring human agents and seeking a more productive blend of AI efficiency and human empathy. Others are reaching similar conclusions. Ravin Jesuthasan, a senior partner at Mercer, cites lessons he learned from a large-scale case study of AI implementation at a financial services firm. The results were impressive, including a reduction in the work of the current staff by 50% and an 18% reduction in employee turnover. In the article, "Want AI-Driven Productivity? Redesign Work," he argues the key to lasting AI success is to start with the work, not the technology. These early experiences emphasize the importance of a focus the messy, human, frequently-changing work that is at the center of any good AI application. Starting with the technology risks missing something important that can erode financial benefits. So what should executives do? Success is more about mindset and taking an holistic approach than it is about technology. Moving beyond a narrow focus on efficiency will lead to more durable and customer-friendly technology and more productive workplaces.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond The exit interviews of Diamond Comic Distributor Staff, Lee Butman, Matt Demory, Joe Lunday, Trista Peterson, Sadie Campos and Ryan Shelkett The Exit Interviews for the six members of Diamond Comic Distributors who quit on the same day to go work for Alliance Entertainment, following Mike Schimmel, and kicking off another lawsuit in the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of the comic book publisher, have been unsealed. And they paint a picture of a distributor that people were pretty happy working at, until the bankruptcy. Though they did talk about the poor communication, both traditionally and with the new owners, how they didn't like learning things about their jobs and the bankruptcy on Bleeding Cool, and the lack of career advancement at Diamond due to so many people staying in their jobs and not moving on. Oh and then there were the fist bumps of new owner Joel Weinshanker of Ad Populum. Bleeding Cool published the exit interviews in full, but there's also an additional note Bleeding Cool is adding to Joe Lunday's entry, regarding the mention of fellow Diamond employee Steve Warble. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Merchandise Team Manager DATE HIRED – June 12, 2000 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Lee left the Company due to accepting a role with Alliance Entertainment. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Lee's new role will be Buyer – Consumer Product Specialist. Lee believes he will be working for Ryan Shelkett, former Executive Director of Applications Development. Lee said he was looking for stability. He felt there was a lack of communication from Ad Populum, including that they were not forthcoming with plans and the future. Lee also said he sent out his resume a few months ago to get feelers for potential new employers. Having a family, Lee needed stability to be able to support his family. Lee also shared that he was aware Alliance Entertainment had spoken with others. He said Alliance Entertainment was at the LA Toy Fair a few weeks ago and around the same time they were scheduled to buy the Company. Those who attended flew out to LA just after the deal fell through. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Lee said what he liked most were the people he worked with. He also said, in earlier years, Diamond felt like family. Once things began to change due to new management, Lee did his best to continue to maintain that type of atmosphere with his team. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Tying into his statement above, Lee felt, unfortunately, that the last ten (10) years seemed more corporate and colder. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Pretty good – Lee felt Ryan Shelkett did a good job, once he settled into his new role. Lee felt, ultimately, morale improved. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Lee said it was tough to advance. There were "long timers" in the Company. Therefore, it was hard to see opportunities to advance. C. COMMUNICATION – Fair – Lee felt the last five (5) months were not good. He hated that he read so much about what was happening in Bleeding Cool, versus the Company sharing information. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Good F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – If it weren't for the bankruptcy and recent sale, Lee envisioned working at Diamond until he retired. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – understood DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Assistant Manager – Print Team DATE HIRED – July 18, 2012 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Matt said he did not want to leave the Company. He had no ill will towards Diamond. That said, he had to do what was best for him and his family. He felt that Diamond lost too many employees and the core competency…too many pieces of the puzzle are gone. He said he was not sure how Diamond Book Distributors sales is supposed to function. He also felt that too much of the industry is rejecting Diamond, and too many businesses have made it clear they do not want to continue business with Diamond. Instead, they are moving to competitors. It seemed to become a trend where others felt this is what I'm supposed to do since everyone else is doing it. Matt's impression was DC and Marvel leaving made it look easy, so others followed. All that said, Matt worried that some of those that left realized the grass was not necessarily greener on the other side. However, they were locked into contracts that they could not get out of. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Matt will be a Buyer with Alliance Entertainment. He said they contacted him with an employment offer. In his new role, he will be working with a new set of accounts. However, he will continue using his skills to manage inventory. 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No – Matt was ok with his salary. However, he was drained emotionally. He said he constantly felt like he was on the front line defending the company. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said he enjoyed everyone on his team. He grew up with comics and wanted to do something to encourage other kids to have the same opportunity. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Matt said what he liked least was the software. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Matt enjoyed the freedom to work independently with the understanding that guidance was always available when needed. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Matt described advancement opportunities as "pretty flat". C. COMMUNICATION – Excellent – Matt felt people were good to respond timely. D. BENEFITS – NA – Matt said he was on his wife's insurance. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Poor – Matt could not remember the last time he received a pay increase. He understood that the Company faced tough times which resulted in no recent pay increases. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Excellent – Matt wished the very best for the future of the new Diamond. He hoped it could survive given how many were no longer with the Company as a result. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – Matt said he fully understood our policy. He felt that Alliance Entertainment has their own systems and way of doing things. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Matt said he very much respects Diamond. DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Director of Ecommerce Sales DATE HIRED – November 28, 2022 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Joe left due to accepting a position with Alliance Entertainment. Joe will be helping to build the collectibles and toy program. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? Yes – However, he also said he was not going to be receiving a huge bump in pay. Joe added he was concerned about Diamond's future now that the sale to Ad Populum has taken place. Joe said he had a conversation with Chuck Parker, President, and was encouraged to stay but he had concerns about the future with vendors and the company, overall. Joe also said morale is very low across the organization. Ad Populum has provided no communication, leading others to wonder how much they really care about employees. Further, they eliminated the necessary roles to keep any attempt at success very limited. Additionally, Joe said when Joel Weinshanker from Ad Populum was in town and meeting with various employees, Joe's meeting with him, which he thought was scheduled for 15 minutes, lasted 4 minutes. Joe's impression was that it was 2 minutes longer than Joel would have liked. Joel came off as very off putting. Joe went into the meeting with questions for Joel. Joe walked away with the strong impression that Joel really only wanted the warehouse and was meeting with employees as a formality. Also, when Joe walked into the meeting, Joel fist bumped him and then proceeded to read his name and title off of a piece of paper. Joel then asked what Joe did. Joe explained his role in sales and read sales data information from last year. He further described the business…Japanese, Taiwan, Amazon, Godzilla. Joel asked who his contact was at Amazon. Joel gave very little feedback during the brief encounter. Joe shared that he later spoke with Steve Warble, Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager. Steve told Joe that his meeting lasted 3 minutes. He, too, had the same impression of Joel. Additionally, Joe said he was speaking with someone else (he did not share who) and that individual said that Joel told them directly "you know I did not get a good first impression of you". Joel later changed his tune when he admitted to needing the person. Joe also said that he was told that Mike Schimmel and Tim Lenaghan were forced by Joel to make snap staff decisions…keep vs who to let go. This was hard for them to do given that many of the staff are in various departments. Therefore, Mike and Tim did not have strong knowledge of good vs bad. They felt like that had to make random decisions vs well thought out. 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said what he liked most were the people. He also enjoyed being able to maximize sales. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Joe said, long term, he always struggled with pay. He felt Diamond lost a lot of good people due to the low pay they provided. Further the pay did not always match the talent. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Excellent – Joe felt his team was well organized. B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Good – Joe said he started in Order Entry, then moved to Retailer Services and ultimately moved into the role of Sales Manager and promoted to Director. Joe said his only resentment was not being made a Director sooner. He left the Company for a period of time to go to Funko. It was when he returned that he was made a Director. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Joe said he spoke quite a bit recently with Chuck Parker. Joe felt Chuck was trying very hard. He felt bad for Chuck as he wanted to give feedback but needs guidance from the new owners to let people know what is going on. D. BENEFITS – Good – Joe said he only participated in the 401K plan since he is on his wife's insurance. He also felt the vacation and sick time was generous. E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Joe said this was tough to answer. He felt it went through a lot of phases and, unfortunately, many people went without raises for a long time. Further, as stated above, many were underpaid for the work they did. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Joe said he believed in Diamond. He said there was a reason he chose to return after he left for a period of time. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? Joe said he fully understood the Company's policy. OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Joe said, going forward, he was concerned for those employees who were staying with Ad Populum. He hopes they have a future there, and hopes they are paid accordingly, particularly given the reduction in staff which will result in more work. Also, Joe pointed out that he was told he would be receiving a retention bonus of 10% of his salary, which he said was $9,300. He would like to know when he will receive this. ADDITIONAL: Steve Warble, Diamond Sales and Marketing Inventory Manager posted to Daniel Best's Substack, who has also posted these exit interviews, saying "For the record, my meeting with Joel was only about 5 minutes, but I deny ever saying that I thought Joel only wanted us for the warehouse. I did say that another employee who I won't name had said that exact thing. I am also furious that my name has been dragged into this without anyone asking me" also adding "I am not angry at you or any other journalist that quotes the legal documents, and there is no need to redact anything. I am not even angry at Joe Lunday, as I know he is an honest man and I am sure he stated the conversation as he remembered it. I am angry that those documents misrepresent my position and the conversation as I remember it." If there are any other people mentioned who want similar additional statements of added context, please let me know.

Trista stressed, without being asked, that Mike Schimmel, former Vice President of Sales, did not poach her to join Alliance Entertainment. She said she had applied to Alliance Entertainment months ago to see if there were any Buyer positions. Trista said that Alliance Entertainment started "sniffing around" at the recent Toy Fair. She said they reached out to her to discuss joining their Company. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? Trista's new role will be Director of Sales – Collectibles Division 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? Trista said salary is always a consideration when determining future in a current role.

Trista also said she wished nothing but the best for "new" Diamond. And she said, "as silly as it sounds…she loved the name Diamond". 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Trista said communication lacked and seemed siloed, particularly over the last few months. She found it frustrating that information was not shared with employees. Instead, information was learned from Bleeding Cool and ICV2. Because information was on the internet, retailers contacted Trista and her team. However, they were not able to answer questions. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Fair – As stated earlier, Trista was focused on titles. She said she came to Diamond with the hopes of becoming a Director, as this was a personal goal of hers. She did admit she could have communicated better so others knew what her goal was. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – See above D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Poor – Trista said she took a $40,000 pay cut to come to Diamond. She also felt the commission structure should be reevaluated. She felt the Sales Reps are clearly underpaid in this area for the work they do and sales that they make. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Trista only wished the best for the future of the Company. She loved Diamond and what it did for small retailers. She said the bankruptcy was truly unfortunate and hoped the new owners were successful. Overall, Trista said everyone that she came into contact with was wonderful. She said it was hard to say goodbye. She appreciated the "family owned vibe" and was very grateful for the opportunity she had at Diamond. Trista also wanted it noted that she appreciated her recent interactions with Chuck Parker, President. She said he was so nice and felt bad for the position he had been put in. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No – Fully understood DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Business Development Manager DATE HIRED – June 10, 2024 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Sadie she was leaving the Company due to accepting a position with another company.

WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Sadie said what she liked most about the Company was the product and the people. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Sadie said what she liked least were the financial concerns. Sadie said she joined the Company in June 2024. Very shortly, thereafter, communication began about the cash flow concerns. That was very unsettling. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – NA – Sadie felt, because she had only been with the Company for just under a year, she could not answer this question. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Sadie felt communication across the companies was poor. She said she worked a lot with Diamond Select Toys & Collectibles, LLC (DST) and it was like pulling teeth to get them to respond to anything. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Sadie said she was happy with her compensation. F. OVERALL OPINION OF THE COMPANY – Good – Even with everything going on, Sadie said there were a lot of great things about the Company. That said, she felt there was zero infrastructure. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLICY REMINDER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU? No OVERALL GENERAL COMMENTS: Overall, Sadie said when the announcement about the bankruptcy came out, she could handle that. She was disappointed that with the lawsuits up to what is transpiring now, there is no communication. She was frustrated that nothing was shared about DST being shut down after the sale and with no plan in place for "what's next". Sadie interacted with DST on a regular basis. She felt she was left to pick up the pieces with no direction. Sadie said morale is awful and stressed that a Team Hall needs to take place, so people understand what is going on. Sadie also liked that the Company allowed employees to work remote. That said, her perspective was that many people took advantage of it. From day 1, Sadie said she could have listed names of people who should have been let go due to not working. Unfortunately, some of those people were still with the Company (Sadie did not provide names). DATE – May 30, 2025 POSITION – Executive Director of Applications Development DATE HIRED – August 28, 2023 TERMINATION DATE – May 30, 2025 MAIN REASON FOR LEAVING – Ryan left Diamond to accept a position with Alliance Entertainment. He will be their Vice President of Purchasing. Ryan said they contacted him to discuss a job offer. Ryan explained that he had been looking for a new job since the bankruptcy announcement was made in January 2025. He researched opportunities in a variety of industries. However, he stopped when he was asked to stay through the transition period. Ryan also said he was told by Tim Lenaghan, Chief Purchasing Officer, if he stayed, he would receive a retention bonus of $16,000. Ryan said he continued to check the court docket and saw that the court had approved the issuing of these. Based on what he read, Ryan strongly believes he is eligible for this and wanted to know when he could expect to receive it. 1. WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE IN YOUR NEW JOB? See above – Ryan was scheduled to begin his new job on Monday, June 2, 2025. Ryan also pointed out that he and Mike Schimmel, former Vice President of Sales, will be working in completely different departments. Further, Ryan made it clear that Mike did not contact him in an attempt to bring him to Alliance Entertainment. Ryan said he had run into someone at Alliance, which is how the communication began (he did not mention who the "someone" was). 2. WAS SALARY A CONSIDERATION? No 3. WHAT DID YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT DIAMOND? Ryan said he believed in Diamond. He said he had previously worked for Diamond, left to work for Bandai and then returned in 2023. He said he came back because he loved the concept of the different product available to different stores. He was very much focused on helping with the growth of the business and he truly loved the Company. Ryan also said the coolest thing about Diamond was he got to play in so many sandboxes…Japanese, Hasbro, small boutique, etc…it was truly gratifying. 4. WHAT DID YOU LIKE LEAST ABOUT DIAMOND? Ryan said what he liked least was the fact that the Company had to file for bankruptcy. 5. HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE FOLLOWING: EXCELLENT,GOOD,FAIR,POOR A. WORKING CONDITIONS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT – Good B. ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY – Excellent – Ryan said for him personally, he was very fortunate for the opportunities he received. C. COMMUNICATION – Poor – Ryan was very disappointed in the lack of transparency with numbers and profitability. It made it tough to understand the financial aspect of the toy side of the business, as well as the lack of feedback on any progress. D. BENEFITS – Good E. COMPENSATION AND PAY INCREASES – Excellent – Ryan knew what his salary was when he joined and was very appreciative of his salary. That said, when he joined, he was told he would receive a bonus of 10-20% of sales, based on metrics. Unfortunately, that was never provided. He said when he asked Tim Lenaghan about this, Tim continued to push the topic down the road. Note – Below is the language from his offer letter. I pulled this to see what he was referring to: "The rate for this position will be $155,000.00, to be paid to you on a bi-weekly basis. Additionally, within six (6) months of your start date, we will jointly develop metrics to be used to evaluate a bonus of between 10-20% of this annual salary. $10,000 of this bonus will be provided to you as an initial signing bonus, to be paid to you with the first scheduled pay date, September 8, 2023, after joining the Company. Should you decide to terminate your employment during the first six (6) months of joining the Company, you will be required to return a prorated amount of the signing bonus (based on the months you leave before the end of the successful completion of six (6) months)."

Title: Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat

ByMark Murphy ByMark Murphy, Senior Contributor. Too Many Leaders Are In Denial About AI's Job Displacement Threat There's been no shortage of news about recent workforce changes and even layoffs as a result of AI. Perhaps most famously, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message to employees: "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, speaking on a recent earnings call about AI, said, "But beyond that, all the way from the Finance team preparing for this earnings call, to everything, it’s deeply embedded in everything we do. But I still see it as early days, and there’s going to be a lot more to do." IBM has reportedly eliminated around 8,000 positions, including a large number in HR, while CEO Arvind Krishna noted that the company has been aggressively adopting AI and automation. Joining the list of notable companies with AI-related layoffs are Microsoft, Intel, Meta, CrowdStrike, Salesforce, Dell, and more. Now, technology companies are, not surprisingly, the ones making headlines, but the impact of AI is being felt far beyond the tech industry. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, an AI powerhouse, recently told Axios that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently wrote that "While the technology sector is feeling the first waves of change, reflecting A.I.'s mass adoption in this field, the erosion of traditional entry-level tasks is expected to play out in fields like finance, travel, food and professional services, too." But here's where the story takes a troubling turn. While CEOs and industry leaders are publicly acknowledging AI's transformative impact on employment, a comprehensive new study from Leadership IQ reveals that the vast majority of business leaders may be living in denial about what's actually coming. The AI Readiness 2025 study, which surveyed 1,251 executives, directors, and managers across diverse industries, uncovered a striking paradox that should alarm anyone concerned about organizational preparedness. Despite nearly 80% of business leaders now personally using AI tools—a dramatic surge from just two years ago—a staggering 56.4% either don't expect AI to replace employees in their organizations over the next three years or remain completely uncertain about it. Let that sink in for a moment. More than half of the decision-makers responsible for steering organizations through the AI revolution either don't see job displacement coming or have no idea whether it's coming at all. AI Readiness 2025 Study The breakdown is even more revealing: 35.9% of leaders flatly don't believe AI will replace employees, while another 20.5% simply don't know. Only 43.6% acknowledge that AI will likely lead to job displacement, with just 12.8% expecting a "significant number" of replacements and 30.8% anticipating a "small number." What makes these findings particularly concerning is their consistency with our 2023 baseline study. Despite nearly three years of unprecedented AI development since ChatGPT's launch, despite the public statements from tech CEOs about workforce reductions, and despite widespread personal experience with AI tools, leadership attitudes about AI's employment impact have remained remarkably static. This isn't simply a case of cautious optimism—it's a potentially dangerous case of what researchers call "optimism bias," where decision-makers systematically underestimate the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes. When Andy Jassy tells his employees that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today," but 56% of business leaders don't expect job displacement in their own organizations, we have a fundamental disconnect between industry reality and leadership perception. The implications are staggering. If the majority of business leaders are unprepared for AI-driven workforce changes, their organizations will be caught flat-footed when those changes accelerate. Employees will receive inadequate warning and retraining opportunities. Strategic planning will be based on flawed assumptions. And companies may find themselves scrambling to adapt when competitors who took AI's impact seriously begin to pull ahead with leaner, more AI-integrated operations. Perhaps most telling is that this skepticism extends to leaders' views of their own roles. Despite using AI tools daily and seeing their capabilities firsthand, 46% of business leaders either don't believe AI will impact their own jobs or remain uncertain about it. This personal blind spot may be fueling the broader organizational denial. It's a classic case of "it won't happen to me" thinking, amplified across entire leadership teams. If executives can't acknowledge that AI might transform their own roles—roles that often involve strategic thinking, analysis, and decision-making that AI is increasingly capable of supporting or even replacing—how can they realistically assess the impact on their organizations? This leadership disconnect creates a "preparation crisis." While AI capabilities continue expanding at breakneck speed, the majority of organizations may be operating under the assumption that significant workforce disruption isn't coming—or at least isn't coming soon. The contrast with forward-thinking leaders couldn't be starker. When Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% within five years, he's not speaking hypothetically. Anthropic is at the forefront of AI development, and their CEO has a front-row seat to what's coming next. Yet our study suggests that most business leaders either haven't internalized these warnings or don't believe they apply to their organizations. This isn't just concerning—it's potentially catastrophic for organizational competitiveness and employee welfare. Despite these concerns, there is a glimmer of hope. A recent PwC report found that workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium. And given how few people have advanced AI skills, it's really not that hard to elevate your AI skillset quickly and stand out from everyone else. As Amazon's CEO put it in his memo, "Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company."

Title: CEOs Are Quietly Telling Us the Truth: AI Is Replacing You

The fear is real. In meetings, Slack chats, and after-work drinks, one question is quietly eating away at millions of employees: Will AI take my job? In public, CEOs like to sound reassuring. They say generative AI will âenhance productivityâ or âstreamline operations.â But when you actually read what they’re telling their own employees, or what slips out in investor memos, the message is chilling: virtual workers are here, and theyâre not just assistants. Theyâre replacements. Letâs take a closer look at what some of the worldâs most powerful tech CEOs are saying. Not in hype videos, but in official internal messages, blog posts, and investor updates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently published a company-wide message that sounds reasonable, until you actually read it. âAs we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today… We expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.â The key phrase? âNext few years.â Thatâs corporate speak for 2026 to 2028. Not ten years away. This is soon. Jassy is not talking about automating only simple or repetitive tasks. Heâs preparing employees for a reality where AI replaces entire job categories across the board, and where hiring slows or stops altogether for roles that machines can now do. In a memo posted to LinkedIn, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was even more blunt. âMost functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work… Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.â Translation: No more hiring unless your job is impossible for AI to do. The company is betting that most teams will soon need fewer humans. Shopify CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke shared a similar directive on X: âBefore asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI… What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?â LÃ¼tke is openly asking managers to reimagine teams as if AI agents are already integrated, and to justify why any humans are still necessary. https://t.co/6i6h3sKi3x — tobi lutke (@tobi) April 7, 2025 The message from these CEOs is clear: human employees are now the last resort. The new default is automation. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI is already doing 50% of the work within his company, shortly before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. The CEO of Klarna, a major fintech company, was even more blunt, revealing that AI has already allowed the company to reduce its workforce by 40%. These arenât future scenarios. This is already happening. The reason for this sudden shift is the rapid evolution of AI technology. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a recent podcast, the latest “reasoning models” have made a critical leap. In simple terms, these AI systems can now do more than just find information; they can “think” through complex, multi-step problems. Altman suggested these models can reason on par with someone holding a PhD, meaning they are now capable of performing the high level analytical tasks once reserved for highly educated humans. This capability is being actively harnessed. Three sources working at major AI labs told Gizmodo that they are training powerful models to perform real world tasks in nearly every “knowledge work” profession, including banking, financial analysis, insurance, law, and even journalism. These sources, who requested anonymity as their contracts prohibit them from speaking publicly, described how their work is used in side by side comparisons with AI models to refine the technology until it can produce professional grade output with minimal errors. Virtual employees are already doing our jobs; the current phase is simply about making them more perfect. The “next few years” Jassy spoke of may be closer to two years at most. Consider the tech industry’s recent layoff trends. In 2024, 551 tech companies laid off nearly 152,922 employees, according to data from Layoff.fyi. The pace has accelerated dramatically this year. In just the first six months of 2025, 151 tech companies have already laid off over 63,823 people. On average a tech company cut 277 workers in 2024. If that rate is maintained for the rest of the year, the average number of layoffs per tech company in 2025 would soar to 851, roughly three times the 2024 average. While there is no direct evidence linking all these layoffs to AI, the trend is happening during a period of record economic strength. The Nasdaq just closed at an all time high, and eight of the world’s ten largest companies are in the tech sector. Profitable, growing companies are shedding workers at an alarming rate, and the quiet implementation of AI is the most logical explanation. Tech CEOs wonât tell you outright that youâre being replaced. But the memos speak for themselves. AI is already here, and your company is likely building a roadmap to automate you out of your role. One internal pilot project at a time. One chatbot at a time. One hiring freeze at a time. If you want to understand whatâs next for the American workforce, donât listen to the marketing. Read the footnotes in the CEOâs blog. Because theyâre already telling you the truth.

Welcome to Life-as-a-Service. An employee's public lament over poached colleagues and a company-wide shutdown reveal a difficult truth: the human cost of building AI is reaching a breaking point.

Update font size. Reset Beleaguered Intel has started layoffs in California as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring plan led by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This follows Tan’s August announcement that job cuts were inevitable, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in the company’s workforce. Anton Shilov for Tom’s Hardware: ‎ Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products… The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote over twelve years ago: [Intel’s decision to pass on Apple’s iPhone] has to be close to the top of the list of Biggest Business Mistakes in History. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley engineer or have any technical background at all, to make ... More money with AI AI has become such a controversial topic. It's one of those things where you can look at it extremely positively, but extremely negatively at the same time. For example, just over a week ago, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that the effects of AI in the organization would lead to large-scale layoffs and workforce reductions across the Big Tech giant, as more AI tools are being implemented and integrated across their workflow and systems. While this certainly spells bad news for employees who feel stuck within these roles, on the flip side, if you’ve been a casualty of an AI-induced layoff, there is still hope, because you can actually make AI work for you, not against you. You can actually join the opposition, so to speak, and leverage your existing skills while upskilling in AI, to build an AI-powered business as a freelancer. What’s really interesting is that more employers are outsourcing their work to freelance contractors. With freelance hiring up by 260% in the past two years alone, there’s never been a better time to be laid off, because opportunities are ripe for you to start your own business and pivot your career. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to launch your own venture, this is it. You can get started today, upskill relatively quickly, and capitalize on the strong interest that organizations have with implementing AI. Use this to your advantage so that you can effectively create your own job, hire yourself, and get paid for it. You know what’s even better? The AI-powered freelance business ideas listed in this article are no-code. This means you don’t need to be a software developer, ML engineer, or have a computer science background for these to work. Each of these ideas has the potential to rake in $100,000 or more a year in client contracts, projects, and consulting work. Let’s get into the list: There are two ways of looking at AI consulting. One is where you go deep into the development aspect of implementing AI into organizations. This is where you’ll definitely need to have solid technical background. But the other way of looking at it is a no-code approach. Some no-code options and services you can deliver for AI consulting work include: How much it pays: AI consulting work can pay as much as $175,000 a project. Create a monthly swipe file or kit of resources that your target clients can use, which will help them solve a specific problem. Monthly subscriptions are an excellent business model because they ensure longer retention and help to future-proof your career and finances due to their consistency. Additionally, this business model is perfect because it provides passive income, and it has low overheads. Often, you can start for less than $50, using one or more AI tools and Canva. They also support you during feast-or-famine cycles when clients from other streams of income may be running dry, and they make it easier for you as a freelancer to accurately predict and plan for your future financially, as well as making larger purchases. Some examples of AI-powered digital subscriptions you could offer include done-for-you marketing services, like: You can also combine some services to create higher-tier offers. For example, you could offer a YouTube content calendar, plus a strategy session, plus YouTube scripts. How much it pays: This business model provides unlimited income and can easily be scales and automated. Ask ChatGPT to draft a list of learning objectives and an outline for your niche corporate training program (the niche could be corporate wellbeing, sales, leadership training, etc.). Use it to brainstorm for the content and to develop the talking points of your presentation. Then, use AI tools like Prezi.ai or Canva’s AI features to help you develop the slide deck, and finally, ask ChatGPT to create survey questions relevant to your training, that you can give to attendees at the end of the session. How much it pays: Corporate trainers make about $87,000 a year, but on the higher end some are known to earn as much as $112,000 according to ZipRecruiter. That being said, if you provide digital products that can sell on their own, like ready-to-sell courses, you can make more money. Yes, you can build a business with AI. You just need to ensure that the following ingredients are in place: AI consulting is an extremely lucrative freelance business, with some projects paying upwards of ... More $150k Can I really make $100k a year using AI? Yes, AI has unlimited potential, and it’s only restricted by how and where you apply it. Once you spot a pain point, apply your expertise and use AI to back your solution so you can deliver it more efficiently and scale your income at the same time. Do I need to learn how to code to start an AI-powered business? No you don’t need coding knowledge. Business ideas like AI consulting focus on strategy and implementation advice.

Title: JCPenney Gifts $10,000 Dream Wedding to LA Couple Amid Brand Revival

While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .
