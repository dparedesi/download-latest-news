Title: Amazon Plans to Cut 30K Jobs Amid AI Push

Amazon is preparing to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees starting Tuesday, according to sources cited by Reuters. The move is part of a broader effort to cut costs and address overhiring that occurred during the pandemic's surge in demand. While the cuts represent a small fraction of Amazon's total workforce of 1.55 million, they account for nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate staffers—and amount to the largest round of layoffs since 2022, when about 27,000 jobs were cut. Per a source who spoke to CNBC, this round of cuts will be the biggest ever for the company's corporate employees. The layoffs are expected to span multiple divisions, including human resources, devices, services, and operations. Managers in affected areas were reportedly given training on Monday to prepare for informing staff, with official notifications set to begin Tuesday morning. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing to streamline company operations, reduce management layers, and cut back on what he describes as excessive bureaucracy. Amazon has introduced an anonymous complaint system to identify inefficiencies, resulting in hundreds of process changes. Jassy has previously indicated that increased use of artificial intelligence is likely to drive further job reductions, as automation replaces repetitive tasks. The exact number of layoffs could change as Amazon's financial priorities evolve, but reports suggest that the human resources division alone may see cuts of around 15%. Despite the reductions, Amazon is still planning to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period, matching previous years.

Amazon is preparing to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions. This is the largest single layoff under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. The company cites cost-cutting and the integration of AI as primary drivers. This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions.

This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. In a move that sends a chilling message about the future of the white-collar worker, Amazon is preparing to swing the axe on a staggering 30,000 corporate employees. The job cuts, set to begin Tuesday, represent a nearly 10 percent reduction of the companyâs 350,000-person corporate workforce and mark the largest single layoff since the tech giant eliminated 27,000 positions beginning in late 2022. This decision, driven by a push for cost-cutting and the integration of artificial intelligence, highlights a disturbing trend where corporate efficiency is prioritized over the livelihoods of thousands. According to reports from Reuters, the layoffs will ripple across multiple divisions. The corporate bloodletting is expected to affect human resources, known internally as the People Experience and Technology or PXT group, as well as operations, devices and services, and the vital Amazon Web Services cloud unit. This strategic shift underscores a fundamental restructuring of how the corporate behemoth operates, moving away from human labor and toward automated systems. The scale of this layoff is unprecedented for Amazon under CEO Andy Jassyâs leadership. Since taking the helm from founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy has overseen a relentless campaign to trim what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy. This latest cut of 30,000 jobs, however, dwarfs previous efforts and signals a new, aggressive phase in the companyâs operational philosophy, one that appears to view a significant portion of its corporate staff as expendable. A pattern of corporate contraction This is not an isolated event but part of a concerning pattern. The planned 30,000 job cuts follow the 27,000 positions eliminated in 2022 and 2023. This repeated contraction suggests a company in a perpetual state of flux, one that rapidly expanded during the pandemic only to just as rapidly discard the very employees who helped manage that growth. The human cost of this corporate strategy is immense, creating widespread uncertainty and instability. At the heart of this workforce reduction is a relentless drive to reduce costs and reverse what the company calls "pandemic-era overhiring." Yet, this justification rings hollow to those who remember the massive profits Amazon reaped during the same period. The company now seeks a "stronger cost structure," a corporate euphemism that often translates to shattered careers and broken families for those on the receiving end of a pink slip. The role of artificial intelligence in these layoffs cannot be overstated. Jassy himself has been a vocal proponent of AI, acknowledging that its increased use would lead to job cuts by automating repetitive and routine tasks. In a June communication, he warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind. He wrote that those who âbecome conversant in AIâ would be best positioned to âhelp us reinvent the company.â This creates a troubling ultimatum for workers: adapt to the technology that may replace your colleagues or become obsolete yourself. Efficiency comes with a human cost Managers of impacted teams were instructed to undergo special training on Monday to learn how to communicate the bad news to their staff. Email notifications are scheduled to start going out on Tuesday morning, a cold and impersonal method for delivering life-altering news. The process reduces human beings to mere data points in a cost-saving algorithm, stripping away the dignity of work and loyalty. Further adding to the callous nature of these cuts are reports regarding Amazonâs stringent return-to-office policy. The policy, among the strictest in the tech industry, was reportedly intended to generate employee attrition. When that failed to produce enough voluntary departures, the company allegedly told some remote employees they had "voluntarily quit" and could leave without severance, a blatant maneuver to save money at the direct expense of workers. While Amazon pares back its corporate roles, it simultaneously announced plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush. This dichotomy reveals a corporate priority for flexible, temporary labor over stable, long-term careers. It paints a picture of a future workforce where permanent positions are scarce and job security is a relic of the past. As artificial intelligence and automation become central to corporate strategy, the very definition of work and the value of the worker are being radically redefined, and not necessarily for the better. The pursuit of profit and efficiency, it seems, has a very human price.

Title: Amazon prepares for major layoffs among office workers, media reports say

Amazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by "approximately 14,000 roles". Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers. Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company "even stronger" by shifting resources "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well. At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn). But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and was "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she added. The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was "working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon. Those who cannot will receive "transition support" including severance pay, it said. The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK. The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide. This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year. Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services. Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency. Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said then. Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years. It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic. After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when - its enormous AI investments would pay off. Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors. Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts. "We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly," he told the BBC. "They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable."

Amazon's latest cuts fed into anxiety about AI replacing workers. But some are sceptical that recent layoffs are a telling sign of how AI is affecting employment.

The Dow and Nasdaq also reached all-time highs. Fed rate cut, US-China trade talks, and key tech earnings, despite an ongoing US government shutdown add uncertainty.

Title: Amazon To Slash Up To 30,000 Corporate Jobs, Largest Cut Since 2022: Reuters
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/amazon-to-slash-up-to-30000-corporate-jobs-largest-cut-since-2022-reuters
Time Published: 2025-10-28T01:20:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon is reportedly planning a massive reduction in its non-warehouse staff, targeting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting this week, as the e-commerce giant works to pare expenses and correct for pandemic-era overhiring, according to three sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters. This significant workforce contraction, which would be the largest layoff at Amazon since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated starting in late 2022, represents nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate employees. The job cuts are expected to begin with email notifications being sent out on Tuesday morning, following preparatory training given to impacted team managers on Monday, Reuters reported. The core drivers for the reduction are two-fold, an aggressive effort to cut costs company-wide amid a tougher economic environment and to compensate for the major staffing boost that occurred during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic when demand for online commerce surged. The scale of this reduction highlights a continued trend of efficiency drives across the tech sector. Sources indicated to Reuters that the cuts may impact a wide array of divisions, including human resources, known internally as People Experience and Technology, as well as the devices and services and operations groups. This latest downsizing aligns directly with chief executive officer Andy Jassy’s strategic initiative to reduce what he has characterised as an "excess of bureaucracy" within the massive organization, including a focus on managerial layers. Jassy has also publicly suggested that the company's increased reliance on Artificial Intelligence tools would likely result in further job eliminations by automating many repetitive and routine tasks, a shift that analysts suggest is a major underlying factor in such substantial corporate staff reductions. This move, one of the largest single rounds of tech industry layoffs in recent years, underscores the company's commitment to prioritising efficiency over sheer headcount. Despite the deep corporate cuts, Amazon appears to be expecting a strong holiday season. The company still plans to offer 250,000 seasonal jobs to staff its warehouses, matching its seasonal hiring figure from the past two years. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, Reuters noted. The report surfaces just before the company is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce giant plans biggest job cuts since 2022 — over 30,000 corporate roles at risk, says report

Amazon is reportedly preparing to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate positions starting Tuesday, 28 October, marking its largest workforce reduction since 2022, according to a Reuters report citing individuals familiar with the matter. This would mark Amazon's largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. The move is part of Amazon’s broader cost-cutting strategy as it seeks to streamline operations and recalibrate after the Covid-19 pandemic-era over-hiring, when surging online demand prompted aggressive expansion across divisions. While the planned redundancies account for only a fraction of Amazon’s 1.55 million global workforce, they represent nearly 10% of its 3,50,000 corporate employees. The cuts underscore a shift in focus from rapid growth to sustained profitability, as the e-commerce giant navigates a more cautious economic climate and slower consumer spending trends. Amazon last executed major layoffs in late 2022, eliminating approximately 27,000 roles across its business units. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions. Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but other areas of its core consumer business are also likely to be affected. Amazon has declined to comment publicly on the planned layoffs despite multiple media requests. According to Reuters, the company directed managers of affected teams to undergo communication training on Monday in preparation for staff notifications, which are expected to begin via email on Tuesday morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in the company's history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed. Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staff on their payrolls. Andy Jassy himself is one of those employers. The CEO fired a warning to his employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also said there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Since succeeding Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, Jassy has built a reputation as a cost-cutter and operational reformer. Amazon managers are routinely required to meet targets for ‘unregretted attrition’ (URA), a measure indicating the percentage of staff the company can afford to lose through voluntary departures, managed exits, or layoffs. However, people familiar with developments told Fortune that the latest wave of cuts is being treated differently within the company, signalling a broader restructuring effort rather than a routine trimming of underperforming staff.

Title: Report: Amazon to let go of up to 30,000 employees, starting this week
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/27/report-amazon-let-go-30000-employees-starting-week/

UPDATED 20:08 EDT / OCTOBER 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is reportedly planning to let go up to 30,000 employees in what would be its largest ever round of layoffs. Some workers could be let go as early as Tuesday, as the company makes its latest in a series of moves aimed at cutting down costs and conserving cash. A report by Reuters cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter as saying that the job cuts would represent about 10% of Amazon’s global corporate workforce, though not all of them will happen this week. However, it’s expected that thousands of notices will go out to employees this week. The layoffs are set to affect virtually every part of Amazon’s enormous organization, including its human resources department, cloud computing and advertising teams, and a number of other business units. The company hasn’t yet finalized the total number of reductions, according to one anonymous source. The layoffs come at a time when many American companies are looking for ways to reduce their operating costs or at least slow their head count growth, due to rising prices, a tight labor market and the on-again, off-again prospect of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In the case of Amazon, Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) has been striving to cut costs for years, partly to compensate for the company’s massive investments in artificial intelligence, which requires the construction of enormous data centers. The online retail giant has laid off about 27,000 employees since 2022. According to Reuters, Amazon views the cuts as part of an ongoing effort to correct its aggressive hiring during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, there was a significant boom in online shopping that resulted in Amazon doubling its warehouse network in less than two years, creating thousands of new blue- and white-collor positions. Jassy has also been looking for ways to do more with less, notably by using artificial intelligence systems to automate work that was previously performed by humans. In June, he became one of the first high profile CEOs in the U.S. to admit that AI will likely eliminate the need for many jobs, and predicted that Amazon will replace humans in thousands of roles in the coming years. He called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change” and noted that it’s already affecting the way it runs its business. “​​As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said at the time. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Earlier this month, Amazon lifted the lid on a new, AI-powered robotic warehouse system called Blue Jay that’s able to automate tasks such as scanning and sorting packages. It’s believed that the system will allow the company to build smaller warehouses closer to consumers in urban areas, where it hasn’t been able to operate so far. In addition, the company is also experimenting with AI tools that can predict shopper’s needs and make recommendations for their next purchases. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Amazon is still trying to adjust its business following its all-out hiring spree during the height of the pandemic. He believes the company is trying to balance the layoffs with the roll out of new automated systems and processes powered by robotics and AI, so as to avoid too much disruption to its business. But doing so is challenging because there’s no real precedent for such maneuvering. “These layoffs are different because it seems they’re going to be applied across all functions within Amazon, but on the flip side it suggests Andy Jassy believes that all parts of its business can be automated with new technologies,” Mueller said. “However, he needs to be careful to time the layoffs and the roll out of its process improvements, because he cannot allow dips in business performance. Amazon’s razor thin retail margins make the timing of the shift to machine decisions very tricky.” Another problem Amazon has to contend with its the growing perception that it’s struggling in AI, with recent comments from analysts voicing concerns that it appears to be lagging behind competitors such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp. In July, Amazon reported a sharp increase in profit and sales for its second quarter, but its cloud computing business failed to match the growth of its rivals’ and its stock declined. At the time, AllianceBernstein LP analysts said in a note that the results posed “uncomfortable questions” for the company about whether it’s an “AI winner or a laggard.” Despite this, Amazon has continued to throw billions of dollars at its AI investments. It reported $31.4 billion in capital expenditure during the second quarter, and explained that most of this was related to building out cloud computing infrastructure for AI. The company said at the time that the number was “representative” of its planned spending for the remainder of the year. Amazon is expected to report its third-quarter financial results after the bell on Thursday, Oct. 30, when we’ll likely learn more about the planned layoffs.

Δ The cuts will target the company’s human resources; operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services divisions, Reuters reported Monday (Oct. 27), citing unnamed sources. The impacted staffers will start receiving email notifications Tuesday morning, according to the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. These job cuts would follow a series of cuts that began in late 2022 and eventually totaled about 27,000 layoffs, according to the Reuters report. The new cuts would amount to nearly 10% of Amazon’s corporate employees, who number about 350,000, but only a small percentage of the company’s total workforce of 1.55 million, the report said. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The company is set to announce its third quarter earnings on Thursday (Oct. 30). Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September 2024 that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with Amazon employees and shared online. When Amazon began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels. In other news, Amazon said Monday that it plans to invest more than €1.4 billion in the Netherlands over the next three years to support both Amazon Web Services and the company’s retail business. The company has served customers in the Netherlands for five years and now has more than 4,500 of the country’s small and medium-sized businesses selling on its platform, according to a Monday press release.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon plans to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees, beginning tomorrow, reports say. The cuts would total nearly 10% of the company’s corporate jobs, as advances in artificial intelligence stoke fears about the white-collar workforce and the US labor market shows signs of weakening. Reuters was the first to report the job cuts. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024 survey filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce. It’s not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the company cut 27,000 workers in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook. The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months, especially for young tech workers. There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as companies cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts say a lot of these fears aren’t backed by substantial research. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Amazon Poised to Lay Off Up To 30,000 Employees Tomorrow

Multiple reports now say that Amazon will lay off up to 30,000 employees as soon as tomorrow, though some layoffs could extend into early 2026. The coming Amazon layoffs were first reported by Reuters, but The New York Times has since independently confirmed the story. Both reports cite multiple sources. And both claim that Amazon is trying to cut billions in expenses and pare down a workforce that ballooned during the 2020 pandemic. Amazon is unique among its Big Tech peers in that it employs far more people because of its massive logistics and warehouse operations, both of which are largely unrelated to technology. It employed over 1.5 million people as of the end of 2024, but only 350,000 or so are considered corporate employees. So the 30,000 figure, if accurate, would be nearly 10 percent of that latter workforce. And the largest single layoff in Amazon’s history. It previously eliminated about 27,000 positions in late 2022 and early 2023. According to Reuters, managers were required to undergo training today to handle tomorrow’s layoffs, and notifications will begin going out via email starting Tuesday morning. The layoffs won’t include Amazon’s annual seasonal hiring binge, with Reuters claiming that the firm will offer 250,000 temporary jobs to help staff warehouses during the coming holiday season. Amazon will report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. The company is expected to spend about $120 billion in the current fiscal year on capital expenses tied to its AI datacenter buildout, a gain of 50 percent over the previous year.

Title: Amazon to Chop 30,000 Corporate Jobs This Week, Its Largest Layoffs Ever

Human resources, devices and services and operations are expected to be the most-impacted branches Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 jobs this week its latest effort to lower expenses. The move, according to Reuters, will impact the company’s corporate arm, with human resources, devices and services and operations receiving the most cuts. Expected to begin rolling out Tuesday, the proposed 30,000 eliminated roles will mark Amazon’s largest-ever round of cuts, surpassing the 27,000 jobs exited in 2022. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly has plans to eliminate an overabundance of managers and beurocracy build-up at the company. He also said back in June that more use of AI going forward would likely lead to other cuts at the company. Amazon did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Layoffs continue to wrack the tech and entertainment industry. Paramount will slash roughly 1,000 jobs on Wednesday in its first round of major cuts under new CEO David Ellison, with additional cuts expected at a later date, according to Bloomberg. The total cuts are expected to impact around 2,000 employees. The latest round of layoffs at the media giant come as new owner Skydance looks to exceed $2 billion in cost savings. In August, Paramount president Jeff Shell warned that the layoffs would be “painful,” but emphasized that the media giant doesn’t want to “cut its way to growth.” And elsewhere in the media world, NBC News eliminated its teams dedicated to covering issues affecting Black, Asian American, Latino and LGBTQ+ groups as part of its layoffs of about 150 staffers. The cuts mean that the verticals NBC BLK, NBC Asian America, NBC Latino and NBC OUT no longer have dedicated teams bolstering their coverage. Tech companies Microsoft, Meta and Intel also saw major layoffs this year, with the latter totaling 22,000 jobs cut so far.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is planning thousands of job cuts across its corporate workforce, and managers have been warned to prepare for an announcement this week, according to people familiar with the matter, an internal document, and internal messages seen by Business Insider. The move is expected to be announced on Tuesday, and will impact employees in the US, the UK, and Canada, according to recent internal messages sent to Amazon managers. A draft email that's due to go out to impacted employees noted that Amazon is eliminating jobs "after a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward." The draft document also described a severance package that includes full pay and benefits for the next 90 days. Business Insider viewed a copy of this draft email, along with copies of the internal messages to Amazon managers. Various teams within Amazon, including human resources and retail, will be affected, the people familiar said. Thousand of employees will likely be eliminated, these people added, while asking not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported the cuts this week could impact as many as 30,000 employees. That would represent roughly 10% of Amazon's corporate workforce. CEO Andy Jassy has been overhauling the tech giant this year, reseting a hardcore culture that existed when Amazon was a smaller, scrappier company. He's slashed layers of management, attacked bureaucracy, enforced strict cost discipline, updated performance metrics and pay structures, and sent most corporate employees back to the office five days a week. That followed a post-pandemic period when Amazon responded to a dramatic growth slowdown. The company scaled back unprofitable projects and trimmed a bloated workforce. Amazon doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has already cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022. In June, Jassy told employees that efficiency gains from AI would reduce the company's workforce. Amazon also froze the hiring budget for its big retail business earlier this year. And the cloud business, Amazon Web Services, saw layoffs in July. Reuters said the job cuts would affect Amazon's HR and devices teams. Fortune previously reported that Amazon could cut up to 15% of its HR staff. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer Amazon is set to lay off tens of thousands of its corporate employees this week, marking the company’s biggest staffing reduction since roughly 27,000 staffers were eliminated at the end of 2022. As first reported by Reuters, the Andy Jassy-led ecommerce giant will cut as many as 30,000 workers — nearly 10% of its corporate workforce — beginning as early as Tuesday. The layoffs come just before Amazon reports its latest quarterly earnings results on Thursday and are, according to Reuters’ sources, part of efforts to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” Related Stories Mohamed Jabaly's 'My Sister Gaza,' Alexandru Solomon's 'Small Expectations' Among 51 Projects Selected for IDFA Forum How Czech Filmmaker Hana Novakova Became 'Obsessed' With the Moose After Its 'Unbelievable' Return to Her Homeland As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. According to Reuters, the corporate staff count is approximately 350,000. Popular on Variety Representatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment Monday. Back in June, Amazon CEO Jassy sent a memo to staff that outlined how generative AI would soon “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” but also cut the overall number of jobs at the company. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. The move is part of an effort to rein in costs after what the company now views as overexpansion during the pandemic boom. The planned layoffs represent nearly 10 percent of Amazon’s roughly 350,000 corporate employees, though only a fraction of its 1.55 million global workforce. If finalized, it would mark the company’s largest round of job reductions since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated beginning in late 2022. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment, according to Reuters. The cuts are expected to hit various divisions across the company. Roles at People Experience and Technology (human resources), devices and services, and operations are among those in the firing line, depending on shifting financial priorities, the report said. Amazon has already trimmed smaller numbers of positions across devices, communications, podcasting and other teams over the past two years. Managers in impacted business units participated in training on Monday to prepare for notification emails scheduled to go out Tuesday morning, according to the report. CEO Andy Jassy has launched a push to eliminate what he has called “excess bureaucracy,” including reducing layers of management. He has set up an anonymous internal system to flag inefficiencies, which has generated about 1,500 submissions and more than 450 process changes so far. Jassy said earlier this year that increased use of AI tools would likely result in further workforce reductions by automating repetitive tasks. The final scale of layoffs may evolve as Amazon’s financial strategy continues to adjust, the sources told Reuters. Amazon shares rose 1.3% to $227.11 near Monday’s close. The ecommerce and cloud giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Amazon Plans Massive Layoffs After Nine Months of President Trump

Online retail giant Amazon plans to slash as many as 30,000 corporate jobs Tuesday, which would be the biggest number of layoffs at the company in three years. Reuters reports that the cuts would amount to 10 percent of the company’s close to 350,000 corporate employees, and would be across different departments. The last time Amazon cut this many jobs was 2022, when 27,000 were slashed late in the year. The move follows Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying in June that AI tools would lead to job cuts. It’s not a good indicator for the economy under President Trump. The website Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts, estimates that 98,344 technology employees have been laid off this year from 216 companies. The site also estimates that 71,981 government employees have been laid off by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, out of a total of 182,528 federal employees departing from the jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report last month showed unemployment at a four-year high, with only 22,000 jobs added in August (compared to a forecast of 75,000). Thanks to the government shutdown, job and unemployment figures from September aren’t known, but they are likely pretty bad. ADP, which processes payrolls, reported earlier this month that the private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September. While the shutdown hides an official tally of how bad employment numbers are in America right now, Amazon’s impending layoffs, and estimates from other sources, indicate that the economy isn’t very strong right now—and the buck stops with the president. California will send election observers to counter the “election monitors” that Trump plans on sending to multiple deep blue districts in the state ahead of next week’s special election. “They’re not going to be allowed to interfere in ways that the law prohibits,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday. “We cannot be naïve. The Republican Party asked for the U.S. DOJ to come in.” “[Trump] is laying the groundwork. He is socializing an idea that is very dangerous,” Bonta added, noting that Trump still claims to have won the 2020 presidential election. “All indications, all arrows show that this is a tee up for something more dangerous in the 2026 midterms—and maybe beyond.” Trump’s Justice Department last week announced it would send federal election monitors to several blue districts in California and New Jersey. In California, the Trump administration is likely well aware of Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional districts to help Democrats gain more seats in the U.S. House. Trump’s DOJ monitoring a crucial election in California is a recipe for basic voting rights to be blatantly violated. Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday called it a “deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.” “They have no business doing that. They have no basis to do that,” he said in a video posted on X. “We have a statewide election for a statewide constitution. This is about voter intimidation, this is about voter suppression. Period, full stop.” Donald Trump's puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month's election.Sending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.We will not back down. Californians decide our future — no one else. pic.twitter.com/olGXV5GBjL The Irish have had enough of Donald Trump. McCormack’s Irish Pub in Richmond, Virginia, made waves earlier this month when its owner, William “Mac” McCormack, released some hot merchandise: a load of “Fuck Trump” black T-shirts, retailing for $11 a pop. The shirts proudly display the pub’s logo: an antifascist emblem superimposed over a shamrock. A printed phrase circles around the icon, reading: “Fuck ICE, Fuck Nazis, Fuck Trump,” according to McCormack’s Facebook. But the top did not resonate with those on the ideological right, who consumed the comment section before spilling over to the pub’s review pages on Yelp and Google. Some commenters scorned the pub’s self-advertised ideology as “disgusting,” deriding the shirts as a stunt that would “alienate half of [McCormack’s] clientele.” One Yelp user, who goes by Marge and lives nearly 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, wrote that the service was “terrible” and the “food is almost as bad.” “Save your time and money. This place sucks. Not a true Irish Pub,” the account wrote, leaving a one-star review on Saturday. “Liberals who think we care where they stand politically.” But any regular would know that the shirt—and its message—are nothing unusual for McCormack’s. “I was just making T-shirts that align with most of my customers, with the pub’s beliefs,” McCormack told RVA Magazine. The shirt is really nothing new. There’s always been some variation of the shirt, according to its owner. “It used to just say, ‘Fuck Nazis.’ We just clarified who the Nazis were,” McCormack said. McCormack’s is one of Richmond’s oldest dive bars. The successful institution has since expanded into two whiskey restaurants—McCormack’s Big Whisky Grill and McCormack’s Whisky Grill—but the original establishment has been proud to be punk since the 1990s, according to RVA. “I’ve never hidden my politics there,” McCormack told the publication. “It’s bigger than just the bar, it’s what you believe. And it’s what I believe one hundred percent.” Despite the backlash, there’s nothing illegal about voicing dissent against the government. Protesting the government is a protected right under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as established by the Founding Fathers. Comparing MAGA politics to Nazi Germany, McCormack told RVA that small-business owners should stick by their principles. “I don’t think we should be silent,” he said. Voicing his disdain for the current administration has actually turned out to be a positive business decision for McCormack, who told RVA that the shirts have since sold out and that “all three locations have been busier than normal.” New customers, attracted by the firm political stance, are going out of their way to share a drink at McCormack’s. Some Facebook users said they would travel from as far as New Jersey to grab a pint at the bar if it meant supporting the cause. McCormack’s advice to other small-business owners: “Don’t be scared to have an opinion.” “You don’t have to do it like I did,” McCormack told RVA. “You can be more subtle, but if we don’t speak up then we’re just the same as those people in Germany who still live with three generations of regret.” Indiana Governor Mike Braun is pushing President Donald Trump’s gerrymandering scheme forward in the Hoosier State—but Republicans still aren’t getting on the bandwagon. Braun announced Monday that he was calling a special legislative session to vote on new congressional districts, ensuring Republicans maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” he wrote in a statement. But Molly Sigart, spokesperson for Rodric Bray, the Indiana Senate’s president pro tempore, told The New Republic Monday that the votes “still aren’t there for redistricting.” The 50-member Senate has only 10 Democrat members, meaning that more than a dozen of the remaining members also opposed the plan. Last week, Bray’s office said that the Republican plan lacked the necessary support, raising red flags for Braun’s redistricting efforts. Meanwhile, Braun’s spokesperson claimed the governor was “confident” that he could secure a majority of state Senate Republicans’ support. Braun initially floated the idea last month of calling legislators back and warned that there would be “consequences” for not keeping pace with the White House’s requests for redistricting, which have already been passed in Texas, Missouri, and most recently, North Carolina. The special session Braun called Monday, which will occur before lawmakers are set to return in January, will likely cost taxpayers a pretty penny. In Indiana, things have gotten heated. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have personally connected with state Republicans about supporting a new congressional map. Last month, Indiana state Senator Jim Banks suggested that podcaster Charlie Kirk’s death was reason enough to do it. “They killed Charlie Kirk—the least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine to zero map,” Banks said. Indiana state Senator Liz Brown, an assistant majority floor leader, published a statement supporting the move Monday. “Redistricting isn’t a technical exercise. It’s power drawn on a map. And Democrats have been wielding it for decades,” wrote Brown on X. “Conservative voices have been thwarted for far too long by liberal states like Massachusetts who refuse to create competitive congressional districts.” “Gov. Braun’s decision to call our legislature into session to address redistricting is welcome news,” she wrote. Exxon is trying to claim that California’s climate laws infringe on its freedom of speech. The oil company filed a lawsuit against the state Friday over two laws, passed in 2023, that require companies doing business in California to disclose carbon emissions and climate-related financial risks, with penalties if they don’t comply. Exxon claims that the laws, known as the California Climate Accountability Package, would force the company to “serve as a mouthpiece for ideas with which it disagrees.” A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, Tara Gallegos, told The New York Times, seemingly tongue in cheek, that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.” The laws, which will be enforced beginning next year, “have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them,” Gallegos added. Exxon said in the lawsuit that it already reports its carbon emissions and climate risks voluntarily but that the state laws would force it to change its framework to one it finds “misleading and counterproductive.” Right now, Exxon uses a methodology to calculate its emissions developed by an oil and gas industry group, but would have to change to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the research group World Resources Institute and business network World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The company claims this framework would send “the counterproductive message that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.” Exxon additionally argues that the legal requirement to report its global emissions should only be focused on the company’s emissions in the state. Exxon is also fighting against a provision in one law that requires companies to disclose how climate change threatens their business operations and what they plan to do about it. Exxon claims the law requires speculation “about unknowable future developments” and conflicts with securities laws. There is another pending lawsuit against the laws from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, with a trial expected next year. The oil company is trying to dodge transparency about its operations, perhaps concerned about how bad these disclosures would make it look. It may also be hoping for the law to be struck down by conservative judges, or even the Supreme Court. President Trump is loudly dismissive of climate change and the threats it poses, and may take further action against California on his own. Ontario Premier Doug Ford thinks that the Ronald Reagan anti-tariff commercial that set President Trump off was “the best ad I ever ran.” The TV ad featured an edited 1987 radio address from President Reagan, in which he stated that tariffs only serve to “hurt every American.” Trump was so bothered by the ad using someone he likes to compare himself to against him that he started another trade war with Canada, announcing an additional 10 percent tariff on its products over the weekend. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social to justify the tariff hike. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’” But the premier of Ontario, which produced the ad in the first place, isn’t bothered. “You know why President Trump is so upset right now? It was because it was effective,” Ford said on Monday. “The only people that win in a tariff war are the people around the world that don’t necessarily see eye to eye with us and with the United States.” Ford says the ad has received over “a billion impressions around the world.” This shared animosity underscores the schisms that Trump’s retaliatory tariffs have caused with some of America’s closest allies. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, and it’s a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters last Friday, when Trump first began fuming about the ad. “What we can control, absolutely, is how we build here at home.… What we can also control, or at least heavily influence, is developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia, which is the focus of this trip.” Health care access could soon become a pipe dream for some Wisconsinites if Congress doesn’t muster up a budget. The government shut down 27 days ago, in large part over a debate on the merits of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, which assist individuals making upward of 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Still, neither national political party appears willing to shatter Congress’s stalemate on how to fund Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included details to slice billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid. Open enrollment for the subsidized coverage is just days away, but failing to extend the premium tax credits could raise premiums by thousands of dollars a year for people within the affected income bracket all over the country. In Wisconsin, those hardest hit could see their premiums rise by more than $30,000 per year, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers warned Monday. Age and residency also factor into eligibility for the credits. In Barron County, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could see their premiums rise by 800 percent to an annual increase of more than $33,000. Roughly 32 percent of Barron County is above the age of 60, while 73 percent of the population makes less than $100,000 per year, according to 2020 census data. In a statement, Evers argued that the ongoing congressional failure will make “healthcare coverage costs skyrocket.” “Republicans’ reckless decisions are causing prices on everything to go up, from groceries to gas—Wisconsinites cannot afford to pay even more for healthcare, too,” Evers said. “Republicans need to end this chaos and stop working to make healthcare more expensive. It’s that simple.” But Wisconsin is far from the only state expected to suffer. As of last week, more than a dozen states had opened up their Obamacare marketplace for a window-shopping period, including California, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, Maryland, and Maine. Individuals in those states could similarly see prices rise by thousands of dollars annually. Idaho, which has roughly 135,000 enrollees on the marketplace, opened its Affordable Care Act marketplace portal Thursday with a slew of new price tags, offering the nation a glimpse into federal health care services sans federal support. More than 6 percent of the state population, roughly 13,000 people, stand to lose the premium tax credits. The mystery donor who wrote President Donald Trump a $130 million check for the military is believed to be 83-year-old conservative billionaire Tim Mellon. Two people familiar with the conversations identified Mellon to The New York Times, which published the development Saturday. Mellon inherited his fortune from his grandfather, banking magnate and former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, and he has become a major player in conservative politics in his own right over the past decade. Mellon donated a whopping $150 million to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, surpassed only by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Open Secrets. The day after Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges that same year, Mellon donated $50 million to Trump’s super PAC, one of the single largest disclosed contributions ever. With this latest donation, it’s clearer than ever that Trump’s White House has been bought and paid for by the billionaire class. But this particular payment will hardly make a dent. Split among the military’s 1.3 million service members, the donation will come out to about $100 per person. Last week, Trump announced that his administration had received a $130 million donation, and the Department of Defense confirmed that the government had accepted the money in order to “offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits” under the “general gift acceptance authority.” On Friday, Trump declined to say who the donor was, only saying he was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man” who would “prefer that his name not be mentioned.” Budget experts argued that the donation violated the Antideficiency Act, which puts barriers on the use of funds and personnel during an appropriations lapse, prohibiting the use of funds not allocated by Congress. Legal experts pointed out that Trump was already going out on a limb legally by repurposing other DOD funding to keep service members paid. A federal agent blatantly violated a court order against using excessive force against journalists and protesters last Thursday by pointing a gun in a veteran’s face, saying “Bang, bang” and “You’re dead, liberal.” The Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit representing journalists in the Chicago area, filed a complaint in federal court after the incident, which took place in the city’s Little Village neighborhood. Local residents had gathered to observe and protest a large presence of federal agents in the area, and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino did not respond well or care to take the earlier court order into consideration. According to the complaint, combat veteran Chris Gentry was “lawfully standing on the side of the road voicing his opposition as agents were driving by in their vehicles.” That’s when an agent pointed a gun at him and threatened to kill him. That was just one of many shocking incidents that day. Bovino also allegedly threw a tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters, who, according to the complaint, were not violent or committing any crimes. Some of the protesters attempted to talk to Bovino and other federal agents there and were rebuffed. Bovino and his colleagues instead shoved several people and threw more tear gas canisters at them, according to the complaint. The Department of Homeland Security claimed in a social media post that protesters “shot at agents with commercial artillery shell fireworks” and that they attacked federal agents first, which the complaint calls a lie. Further, the complaint quotes protesters who say that the crowd in Little Village was peaceful. Bovino claimed to a reporter at the scene Thursday that he was hit with a rock, but did not appear to be injured. Federal Judge Sara Ellis has ordered Bovino to appear in court Tuesday to testify about Thursday’s incidents, as well as sit for a five-hour deposition on November 5. Judging by Bovino and his fellow federal agents’ actions on Thursday, court orders and legal action don’t appear to be a deterrent. Other federal agents nationwide, particularly those working for ICE, have made violent arrests and lied about them, even dragging a four-foot-six blind man outside of a Portland detention facility and dropping him on his head earlier this month. The fatal flaw in the criminal cases against Donald Trump: credibility. Ex-special prosecutor Jack Smith’s legal team was expecting to file the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case in the nation’s capital. But in an attempt to play the case by the book, Smith surprised them by opting to file in Florida instead, where the case would have a one in six chance of landing in Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom, reported The Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig and Aaron C. Davis in their book, Injustice. “Are you all fucking insane?” David Raskin, a federal prosecutor who had worked on the case, blurted out in a Justice Department hallway at the time, according to the Post. Smith believed then that filing in Florida could place the case on firmer legal footing, reducing the possibility that the most egregious charges could be overturned down the line. Smith further trusted that even if the case was randomly assigned to Cannon, they would be able to prove Trump was guilty by sheer volume of evidence. “I’m not worried about Florida,” Smith told Justice Department officials while presenting his decision. Instead, once the case was in her hands, Cannon blatantly took steps to drag it out and turn the tide in Trump’s favor. A year on, the decision to bring the case to Cannon’s doorstep has been interpreted as the case’s death knell. The quest to bring Trump to justice for his alleged crimes disintegrated by election night 2024, by which point the MAGA leader had managed to transform the myriad cases against him into supposed evidence that he was being unfairly prosecuted by a Democratic presidential administration and its DOJ. Trump has since rejiggered the Justice Department in his image, leveraging its heft to prosecute his own perceived political enemies, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former special counsel James Comey. His next target is California Senator Adam Schiff. Smith has also become the subject of conservative-centric controversies. Republican lawmakers accused the former special prosecutor earlier this month of spying on them during his investigation of Trump, claiming Smith tapped their phone lines and monitored their phone calls. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley dubbed the right-wing scandal “worse than Watergate.” Smith and his team have vehemently denied those allegations, clarifying in a letter that they obtained telephone toll records, which only contain information pertaining to incoming and outgoing phone numbers and call duration. They do not contain any details of a call’s contents. Smith conducted two parallel investigations into Trump, both of which resulted in indictments. They centered on allegations that Trump mishandled and retained classified records after the end of his first presidential term, and his alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty on all charges before the charges were dropped altogether after the 2024 election due to Justice Department policy that prevents the prosecution of a sitting president.

Title: Amazon to cut 30,000 corporate jobs — 9% of worldwide office workforce: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/business/amazon-to-cut-30000-corporate-jobs-9-of-worldwide-office-workforce-report/

Amazon will slash 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, according to a report — unleashing one of the US’s biggest job bloodbaths this century as the company aggressively revamps its business with artificial intelligence. Sources told Reuters the reductions — which amount to 9% of Amazon’s global office-based workforce of 350,000 — will begin Tuesday and could unfold over several weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Seattle-based web giant’s sweeping layoffs mark the biggest in a series of major contractions for the company, which has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since CEO Andy Jassy took over from the company’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, Jassy cut a total of 27,000 jobs, Reuters reported. Those cuts targeted Amazon Web Services, its devices group and entertainment units including Prime Video and Twitch. Reuters reported that this week’s layoffs could reach across multiple departments, among them human resources — known internally as the People Experience and Technology group — as well as devices, services and operations. Managers in affected areas were instructed Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief employees once email notifications start going out Tuesday morning, sources told Reuters. The latest reductions come as Amazon doubles down on artificial intelligence and robotics — technologies Jassy has described as central to the company’s next phase of growth. In a companywide email in June, Jassy warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind, writing that those who “become conversant in AI” would be best positioned to “help us reinvent the company.” He also acknowledged that Amazon expected “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company” that would reduce the corporate workforce. “AI is allowing Amazon to cut major costs and playing a key role here around efficiency along with other cost cuts,” Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities, told The Post. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon was preparing to cut up to 15% of its People eXperience and Technology division, known internally as PXT — a 10,000-person unit that includes recruiting and HR tech teams. Those layoffs are believed to be part of the new 30,000 total. The scale of the latest cuts positions Amazon among the largest corporate downsizers of 2025, alongside Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which have also trimmed staff as AI investments reshape the tech industry. The company has been aggressively reining in costs while committing more than $100 billion in capital spending this year to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure. Amazon’s push to automate its operations has intensified in recent months. Internal strategy documents reviewed by The New York Times showed the company aims to replace more than 500,000 jobs with robots and automate 75% of its fulfillment operations by 2033. Executives have told the board that automation could allow Amazon to avoid hiring hundreds of thousands of additional workers in the US while doubling sales volume. Amazon said at the time that the internal documents did not represent its official hiring strategy and that the company would continue to create new jobs in logistics and technology. Jassy’s cost-cutting measures have included mandatory return-to-office policies, stricter performance management and an annual process known internally as “unregretted attrition,” which encourages managers to push out underperformers. The company’s corporate workforce ballooned during the pandemic as online shopping surged. Since then, Jassy has sought to reverse that expansion while redirecting resources toward more profitable segments like AWS and advertising. Amazon’s stock has risen about 20% over the past year but remains volatile amid investor scrutiny over its long-term profitability. While corporate layoffs loom, Amazon said it still plans to hire 250,000 seasonal warehouse and delivery workers for the holiday rush — most of them temporary roles. Jassy has been pursuing a broad campaign to streamline Amazon’s management structure, arguing that the company had become weighed down by unnecessary layers of oversight. Earlier this year, he said an anonymous feedback channel created to flag inefficiencies had drawn about 1,500 submissions and prompted more than 450 process changes.

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor UPDATED with confirmation: Amazon has confirmed it’s laying off 14,000 people in a major reduction of its corporate workforce, citing the advance of AI. Looking ahead to 2026, the company it expects “there will be additional places where we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” as it continues to review its operations. In a memo shared publicly today, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said leaders will communicate with impacted teams and individuals today. Watch on Deadline “Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams – explaining how we want to operate like the world’s largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers,” Galetti wrote, referring to CEO Andy Jassy. “Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We’re already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you’ve done. The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Reports yesterday said the company was targeting as many as 30,000 positions. It’s not clear where the total number will land but it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest round of cuts in the company’s history.. The memo said said Amazon is offering employees 90 days to look for a new role internally and recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles. “For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.” PREVIOUSLY: Amazon is planning a heavy wave of layoffs starting Tuesday impacting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, according to a Reuters report. The e-commerce and web services giant and parent of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video is still working to pare down after over hiring during Covid. The cuts will likely cut across divisions. Layoffs of that degree would represent roughly 10% of the company’s 350,000 corporate employees. Its total global workforce, of some 1.5 million full time and part time, is much larger and comprised largely of warehouse employees. Reuters said the cuts would represent the largest round of layoffs at Amazon since some 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022, and that managers are undergoing training Monday on communicating with staff ahead of pink slips that will begin to hit email inboxes Tuesday morning. Other reports said the total number hasn’t yet been determined. RELATED: Amazon Reorganizes Audio Divisions, Shrinking Wondery Studio And Laying Off 100-Plus Staffers Amazon in August reorganized its audio divisions, laying off more than 100 workers and dramatically narrowing the scope of its Wondery studio. It January of 2024, it laid off several hundred employees across Prime Video and Amazon Studios as part of a review of its business. Amazon reps were’t immediately available to comment. The report comes as the company is one of several circling Warner Bros. Discovery, which formally put itself up for sale last week after receiving interest from multiple parties. It wasn’t clear if the cuts were AI-related, but CEO Andy Jassy has warned that Generative AI will change the way work is done at the company. It will require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he said in a memo to staff in June.

Title: Amazon to Cut as Much as 9% of White Collar Workforce: Report
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-to-cut-as-much-as-9-of-white-collar-workforce-report-2000677605
Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:25:57Z

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Update 10/28: On Tuesday, Amazon announced that it will be cutting 14,000 corporate workers. In a message to employees, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, said: Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business. In other words, she’s saying Amazon is cutting jobs because of AI, but in an exciting way! The affected employees will have a chance to fight for a new position at the company. Galletti said that Amazon will be “offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally” and “recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” This is an update to a previous post on projected layoffs at the e-commerce giant. You can read the original article below. Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday morning, according to a new report from Reuters that cites three unnamed people familiar with the matter. Amazon has 1.5 million employees globally (1.2 million in the U.S.), but about 350,000 of those are corporate positions, according to Reuters. Cutting 30,000 corporate jobs represents almost 9% of Amazon’s total corporate positions. The Reuters report cited overhiring from the pandemic as the impetus of the cuts, but not everyone seems convinced by that argument, given the fact that companies have had plenty of time to tinker with their staffing since the onset of covid in 2020. The last massive job cuts at Amazon saw 27,000 people let go in late 2022. Analysts on CNBC debated what was behind the news on Monday, with two other likely culprits: the rise of AI and President Donald Trump’s extreme tariffs. There was strong debate for and against the case that the reported job cuts were coming due to AI, but nobody seems to really know yet. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to Gizmodo’s questions about the Reuters report emailed Monday. The case of tariffs is easier to make, given the fact that President Trump has been so erratic in implementing them, slapping foreign goods with historically high import taxes. Just this weekend, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canada because he was upset about an ad purchased on U.S. airwaves by the premier of Ontario that featured old footage of President Ronald Reagan warning against tariffs. Trump claimed the ad was AI-generated, which isn’t true. The New York Times reported last week that Amazon has ambitious plans for robotics that will help it grow without expanding its workforce. The goal is to automate 75% of Amazon’s operations, according to the report, which could mean that it won’t have to hire 600,000 new workers it would’ve otherwise needed by 2033. Automation has always caused job losses over the past century, whether it’s physical machines in factories or software that can improve the efficiency of white collar workers. But the hype around AI has created a new cycle in the 2020s that has everyone holding their breath. Will generative artificial intelligence prove to be a massive job killer, or will workers adapt to other positions, and things will become more efficient? Nobody knows where it will go, obviously, even as many people predict that the AI bubble is about to burst. Anyone who knows how things will play out (and has some money to burn) has the potential to earn some big bucks in the weeks and months ahead. Some big names are reporting earnings this week, including Amazon (Thursday), Alphabet (Wednesday), and Microsoft (Wednesday). Wall Street liked the news on Monday that Amazon was cutting jobs, as it often does. The stock closed up 1.25%. The DOW, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all closed at record highs.

Title: Paramount Skydance to Lay Off 1,000 Employees This Week, With Additional Cuts Expected Later
URL: https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/paramount-skydance-layoffs-start-1236561992/

Layoffs are coming down at Paramount Skydance this week, with the freshly merged company looking to slash approximately 1,000 jobs primarily in the U.S. on Wednesday, Oct. 29, Variety has confirmed. Following this week’s cuts, more layoffs are expected at a later date, a source familiar with the plans said. Paramount Skydance, headed by chairman and CEO David Ellison, is undertaking a series of deep staffing cuts that are expected to eliminate a total of around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs taking place internationally. Related Stories Mia McKenna-Bruce to Play Ringo's First Wife Maureen Starkey in Sam Mendes' Beatles Movies A rep for Paramount Skydance declined to comment. The company’s layoff plans for this week were reported earlier by Bloomberg. Popular on Variety Major job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of a stated goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. At an Aug. 7 press conference in New York after the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger officially closed, Jeff Shell, the ex-CEO of NBCUniversal who is now president of Paramount Skydance, told reporters that the company would make cost cuts and layoffs as swiftly as possible and be disclosed by the company’s third-quarter 2025 earnings report to investors in November. Paramount Skydance will report Q3 financial results on Nov. 10 after the market closes. Ellison, founder of Skydance Media, has grand ambitions for the entertainment giant. They include a possible second deal for Warner Bros. Discovery that would transform the combined company into a sprawling rival that might better compete with streaming giants like Netflix and newcomers to the entertainment space such as Apple and Amazon, which have invested heavily in entertainment. So far, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected his overtures. Since taking over Paramount, Ellison has opened his wallet. Paramount shelled out $7 billion for an exclusive seven-year deal for the rights to UFC. The company also recently lured the Duffer Brothers, the creators of “Stranger Things,” over from Netflix with a new four-year exclusive pact to make movies, shows and streaming programming. Some of Ellison’s moves have been more controversial, such as his purchase of the right-leaning outlet The Free Press for a reported $150 million and decision to install its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News despite her lack of television experience. Ellison, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, has signaled a willingness to be aggressive. However, Paramount is grappling with the same issues that are plaguing other media giants. Namely, revenues are falling as viewers have shifted away from cable and broadcast television towards streaming and the theatrical film business has yet to recover from Covid.

Title: Why Is There So Much Consolidation in Hollywood Right Now?
URL: https://nofilmschool.com/why-is-there-consolidation
Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:20:04Z
Full Content:
This is the question on everyone's mind as we see more jobs and markets collapse. 'The Master' It feels like every headline I wake up to in 2025 is some sort of notification that one company is being swallowed up by another one, and what we're supposed to do about it. The fact is that the creative industry of Hollywood is slowly following itself as new studios emerge and older studios combine. The ink is barely dry on the massive Paramount-Skydance merger, which just closed in August, creating a new (and hopefully more stable) entity run by David Ellison. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery—itself the product of a recent merger—is now for sale, and hearing bids from all over. As a writer in Hollywood, I am shedding tears seeing buyers disappear; things are already very hard! But to feel better about the situation, I decided to research and learn why everyone is buying, selling, or merging right now. And it boils down to three main drivers: the end of the streaming wars, a mountain of debt, and a frantic arms race for "universes." Let's dive in. We've been talking about streaming for as long as I've worked at NFS, and we'll continue long after my time is done. It's become the major driver in Hollywood and a way for these studios to make a lot of money. For the last decade, the game was simple: Subscriber growth at all costs. Netflix burned billions on content to get to 250 million subs. Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock all did the same, losing staggering amounts of money to catch up. It's kind of crazy, but Netflix was so far ahead when it came to building a streaming company that all these other studios wound up spending billions to try to compete with them. The thing is, they were unable to keep up, and in committing to the fruitless chase, they laden themselves with a ton of debt that has crippled them financially. Well, after all this, we began to realize that these companies were no longer profitable, and that affected their stock prices and changed the streaming wars. Netflix is a profit machine. Disney's streaming division is finally in the black. But all the other studios that are still losing money on streaming (or not growing fast enough) are in deep trouble. They can be overleveraged and then have to find a way to deal with these losses... which involves selling assets. Streaming is a business of scale. You need a massive global library to justify a subscription and an ad tier. If you can't afford to build that library, your only option is to buy one. This is why Amazon bought MGM (for James Bond) and Disney bought Fox (for X-Men and Avatar). The Paramount-Skydance deal is the latest example: combining Paramount's library (Star Trek, SpongeBob, CBS) with Skydance's proven blockbuster production (Top Gun, Mission: Impossible) to create a single, more competitive service. And it's what makes WB (Potter, Game of Thrones, etc) such a hot thing for sale. It's funny to think that movie studios have crushing debt just as I do with my student loans. And I would totally sell my last name off in order to escape from it. So, let's use Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as an example here. The 2022 merger that combined WarnerMedia and Discovery was sold to investors as a "synergy." But it was really just a way to saddle the new company with a crippling $40+ billion debt. And even though their movies did well at the box office and they continue to raise prices on streaming, they have not made too much of a dent. Ever since, WBD's entire corporate strategy has been about servicing that debt. This is the dark side of "synergy" and consolidation. When those two companies came together, they fired people they thought were redundant and got rid of movies and TV shows they didn't want to pay for moving forward. They did all this with the idea that WBD would actually be a very lucrative target to put itself for sale. It's a shark that wounded itself and is now attracting other sharks. Paramount was in a similar boat, struggling with its own debt. The Skydance merger was seen as a lifeline, injecting fresh capital and a new strategy. But Skydance had a billionaire behind the investment that had so much money, no one was worried about the debt. And he has the favor of Trump, so they assume the White House will approve future mergers as well. What I learned was that mergers are often less about a creative vision and more about two companies lashing themselves together to avoid drowning in their own balance sheets. And if you have a ton of money, you can absorb as much of the market share as you want. - YouTube www.youtube.com In 2025, you don't sell a movie. You sell a universe. Okay, that might be overselling it, but this is an arms race, and if you have a giant world like a Marvel or a DC, you have a ton of characters you can put into movies and TV shows to make money. And studios are always looking to expand these stories as well. The consolidation boom is an arms race for Intellectual Property (IP). A studio head doesn't want to buy your brilliant original screenplay; they want to buy a 10-year plan for a franchise that can spawn movies, TV shows, video games, and theme park rides. When you have fewer, bigger companies, their bets have to be bigger. They can't afford to take a $20 million chance on an original drama. They need to spend $250 million on a guaranteed, IP-driven blockbuster that can be spun off in a million different ways to make revenue wherever they can. This focus on universes makes original, standalone ideas—the lifeblood of independent film—an endangered species at the studio level. This is a very hard time to be working in Hollywood. It dfeelsl ike jobs are disappearing and there are fewer places to sell ideas. Consolidation is affecting everyone, from the execs you need to the crewmembers who will work on the film in production. Everyone is suffering. Let's peek at the ramifications. When the majors abandon the middle, they create a massive vacuum. This is the gap where companies like A24 and Neon built their empires—by championing the exact personal, director-driven films the big studios ignore. The Hollywood consolidation means the "studio" path is narrower than ever. But the audience for unique, original stories hasn't gone anywhere. Your strategy can no longer be to just "sell it." Your strategy has to be to make it and find your audience—because the giants sure aren't going to find it for you. And if you get in good at a studio, the money is there for you to continue to succeed, because they're going to need more stories and more success to sustain themselves. The traditional studio system is shrinking. The giants are too busy fighting each other to care about your indie passion project. It's a hard time to see Hollywood eating itself, but it's a good time to know what you're up against and plan your attack in the new reality we all face. Let me know what you think in the comments.

ByMary Whitfill Roeloffs, Forbes Staff. Amazon is preparing to lay off up to 30,000 corporate workers, Reuters reported Monday, news that comes less than a week after internal strategy documents suggested the company would replace 600,000 workers with robots, artificial intelligence and other automation tools by 2033. Amazon, the second-largest employer in the country, is planning to cut as much as nearly 10% of its corporate workforce to "compensate for overhiring" during the pandemic, unnamed sources told Reuters. The news comes less than one week after the New York Times discovered the company has plans to use robots and other automated systems to do the jobs of up to 600,000 employees in the next eight years, rather than add real people to its roster of 1.55 million employees. The corporate layoffs could represent one of the largest job cuts in company history, potentially surpassing the axing of 27,000 jobs in 2022. A representative for Amazon said they could not comment on the Reuters report.

Despite reported plans to eliminate jobs higher up, Amazon has said it plans to hire the same number of seasonal employees it always does: 250,000 across full- and part-time positions during the end-of-year shopping season. Overall, American employers are planning to hire a record-low number of seasonal employees in the final months of the year. If 30,000 people lose their jobs, the cut at Amazon will rank among the largest corporate job cuts in American history, almost equal with the 31,000 jobs eliminated by Boeing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The Boeing mass layoff is the 10th- biggest in history. It's been a big year for layoffs. By the end of July, job cuts at U.S.-based companies had already surpassed all of 2024 and, though September, employers had announced almost 1 million job cuts, more than any year since the pandemic hit in 2020, according to career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Andy Challenger, the firm's senior vice president, said the job cuts can be largely blamed on a stagnating labor market, cost increases and "transformative new technology," like AI. Technological updates, including automation, are responsible for 20,000 job cuts so far this year and another 17,375 cuts have been explicitly attributed to AI. The government has laid off more employees than any other sector, followed by tech companies, which have cut more than 100,000 jobs in 2025. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the fourth-richest man in the world as of Monday with a net worth of $238.7. billion. Amazon is ranked No. 5 on Forbes' list of the largest public companies in the world, with a market value of $2 trillion. CORRECTION (10/27): This story has been updated to note Amazon reportedly plans to rely on automation to eliminate the need to hire for up to 600,000 roles in the future.

Title: The Reluctant-To-Go CEO’s Guide To Succession Planning

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. CEOs always have a difficult job, but in today’s times of economic uncertainty, tough competition, increasing investor scrutiny to hit performance targets, relentless media cycles and disruption from all sides, it’s getting harder. With all that pressure, a positive and trustworthy relationship between the CEO and board of directors is vital. Earlier this month, the National Association of Corporate Directors released a playbook for both boards and CEOs to deepen this relationship and build trust. NACD formally introduced the report with a roundtable discussion at its annual Directors Summit. A 25-member Blue Ribbon Commission wrote the report, composed of current and former CEOs and board members, co-chaired by Wayne Peacock, former CEO and president of USAA, and Dona Young, former chair, president and CEO of the Phoenix Companies. To begin with, the board and CEO need to build a trust foundation by defining their roles, including how they will work together and how the CEO and board leader can partner. Then they need to operationalize that trust, communicating beyond meetings, enhancing evaluations of one another to reinforce intended behaviors, using executive sessions to help build accountability and transparency, and prioritizing the CEO’s overall well-being. Next, spell out how to leverage that trust to maximize the board’s value as a strategic advisor and assess board composition to align with what is needed for strategy and value creation. At the roundtable discussion, Peacock said that today’s business environment is dynamic, filled with urgency and uncertainty. “If you build trust, you’re operationalizing that on an ongoing basis, then you have the ability to move at a faster pace than you would otherwise have,” he said. “I think also, from a very practical standpoint, whether it’s the noise…or the disruption from other changes that are happening, the ability to separate the signal from the noise as a company today and focus on: ‘What is our mission, what are the values we stand for, what are the things we can control in this environment, and how do we build scenario planning around what could be a wide set of outcomes going forward?” become part of the skills and expertise of senior management in collaboration with the board. Which comes back to: If we built those strong trust foundations, and then we have the ability to use the best thinking of everyone on the board and senior management, we will be better prepared to adapt and change in a much more dynamic environment.” Another important aspect of the board-CEO relationship is succession planning. Sometimes it’s easy, but there are some legacy CEOs—often founders or those who have been there long enough to believe they define the company—who can be difficult to budge from the corner office. I spoke with Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of executive search firm Cowen Partners, about what CEOs should be thinking about succession planning, especially if the “legacy CEO” description hits close to home. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. As the federal government shutdown enters its fourth week with no end in sight, the drag on the economy—both now and in the future—is becoming apparent. Delayed government inflation data for September was released on Friday, revealing that inflation last month continued to tick up. Prices were up 3% compared with a year ago, and had risen 0.3% since August. And consumer sentiment continues to decline, with the University of Michigan’s monthly survey dropping 2.7% to a score of 53.6. According to the survey, Americans’ views on current economic conditions fell to the same level as August 2022, when inflation was 8.3%. An AP-NORC poll last week found that just 32% of Americans viewed the economy positively. Focusing only on businesses, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that this shutdown is likely to suppress Q4 GDP growth by as much as 0.5%, though not completely neutralize growth or turn it negative. How much it will hurt is not known, especially since negotiations to tend the shutdown do not appear to be underway. The most recent government shutdown in 2018 and 2019, which was also the longest on record, had an impact of $18 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Moore wrote. Much of the planned spending for that period happened anyway, but was delayed, so the lost spending was estimated at $3 billion. Some economic policy changes may be close on the horizon, though. The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets later this week and will discuss interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, on Monday morning 96.7% of analysts are expecting a quarter-point rate cut this week, bringing rates down to between 3.75% and 4%. But that’s not necessarily great news. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that the conditions may be ripe for stagflation—when economic growth is tepid, but inflation and unemployment are both rising. Last week, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued some guidance on President Donald Trump’s controversial new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas. Forbes senior contributor Stuart Anderson writes the fee applies to new petitions for the visas filed at or after 12:01 a.m. September 21, as well as for requests for consular or port-of-entry notifications, or pre-flight inspections for noncitizens already in the U.S. It does not apply to people who are already legally in the country and requesting amendments, changes of status or extensions of stay—so the fee would not be required for a person with an F-1 student visa who is applying for an H-1B visa. Additionally, the guidance states that people with H-1B visas may leave and re-enter the U.S. However, Anderson notes, the language in the new guidance seems to be more restrictive than in Trump’s executive order about the fee, and appears to leave little room for exceptions. The new fees are already impacting job offers, even for some of the world’s largest companies. Walmart paused corporate offers to candidates requiring H-1B visas, Bloomberg first reported. The retailer currently employs about 2,390 H-1B visa holders, and a spokesperson told Forbes that Walmart “is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent” and will do so “while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.” The hike in the visa’s fee is being challenged in court. The Chamber of Commerce filed a suit earlier this month, saying the huge hike exceeds the president’s authority and “would inflict significant harm on American businesses, which would be forced to either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available.” Another giant shakeup in the media world could be in the near future. Last week, media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery announced it would launch a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” These could include selling the entire company, selling off either of its two major companies—Warner Bros. or Discovery Global—or going forward with its already-announced plans to split into separate entities, one for its streaming and studio assets, and the other for its global networks, including CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery. The move was likely precipitated by a rumored bid last month from Paramount Skydance to buy the company. The multibillion Paramount Skydance deal had been pending before regulators for a year, and was completed in August after the company made concessions to President Donald Trump’s priorities. The rumored bid has so far not been successful, and Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes that’s probably a good thing, considering Warner’s movie studio has not seen sweeping box office success in the recent past. Another rumored suitor is Netflix, which issued its quarterly earnings report the same day Warner Bros. Discovery announced its review. Bloom writes that much of the discussion on the earnings call was about whether the streaming giant would buy the movie and cable network company. The public answer, at least for now, is no. However, because the broadcast industry is becoming increasingly consolidated, any potential buyer of the company would likely face regulatory scrutiny. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan looked at potential suitors for Warner Bros. Discovery and their likelihood to be able to complete the transaction—looking at both regulatory hurdles and ability to pay. Cohan reported that if the company actually does put itself up for sale, analysts see less obvious suitors with fewer antitrust issues—including Amazon and Apple—potentially making a bid. CEOs are critical. They set the agenda, establish the business tone, develop strategies for the future, serve as the lead business representative and make major decisions. However, executive search firm Cowen Partners president and founding partner Shawn Cole said, no CEO is actually synonymous with the company they lead. All CEOs, from founders to longtime leaders, should prepare for their exits—even if they don’t want to. I talked to him about what all CEOs—especially those who may associate themselves too closely with their role—should think about succession planning. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. There are many reasons legacy CEOs stick around and, at least externally, don’t talk about succession planning. What could make them at least start to think about it? Cole: Business in general is changing faster on a more regular basis than ever. Maybe [a CEO in this position would start] recognizing that I may not be the best captain for the ship anymore, that it is evolving faster than perhaps someone of that profile could keep up with. I also think, unfortunately, that it seems like it’s more of a lifestyle business. It’s not a full-time job, it’s a prestigious title to hold. Are you really giving it 110%, or is it really fun to travel the world and go speak at conferences, engagements or whatnot? Are you a figurehead or are you the CEO? If you want to tie it to wealth and shareholder value, what could be realized by having someone with a bit more energy and a little bit more appetite or knowledge of current events and trends? What would that look like for the share price? I would watch for more and more people dying in the seat. We’re getting to a point of no return, going back to mortality. Do you want that to be your legacy? Do you want your legacy to be total effing chaos when you left—or when you passed away—because you didn’t plan for a successor? Also [think of your] family. Do you really want your final years to be working or do you have other things you’d like to do? In this kind of scenario, where should succession planning start, both on a board level and an individual level? At a board level, you need to start identifying what a transition looks like, what a handoff looks like, what a successful on-ramp of your successor looks like, and who that successor is. The other aspect is it can sometimes turn into that TV show Succession, where it just destroys your C-suite because everyone’s been promised something. [It’s important to] have a clearly defined—internally, externally, shared or otherwise—plan for a successor so that you’ve got your number one and two at the same time, and you align that to your timeline. A lot of succession planning is like the anointment of a successor, and maybe it needs to be a lot more objective. There could be scoring involved. You could hire a consulting firm to assess internal and external candidates—because if you have a legacy CEO, most likely your No. 2 probably isn’t as strong as an outside candidate. You probably already lost some stronger [internal] candidates. They went on to somewhere else where they could have an opportunity to be CEO. Oftentimes these legacy CEOs’ internal pipeline isn’t that strong because they don’t foster strong internal talent. They foster yes people. What advice would you give a legacy CEO about looking at succession and planning? Look to the transitions that have failed, and ask yourself if you want to be the next one. Do you want that to be your legacy? Sometimes the narcissism, the selfishness [makes it appear] they seemingly don’t care or [could say], ‘I did such a good job. It’s impossible to find my successor.’ No. You set this up for failure because it was a knee-jerk response. There was no pipeline. This was not in the works for years. We had to go outside to someone that had no idea what our business was about. I would just ask: What do you want to be affiliated with? Do you want to be affiliated with a smooth handoff and a legacy of success? Or do you want to be the person that retired and it went [south] for lack of planning? What do you want the Wikipedia page to say? You may not be in favor of the Silicon Valley-style 996 workweek, but it is really difficult for a successful CEO to spend just 40 hours a week working. Being in a job that requires more of your time and thought means you need to invest more time on careful work-life integration. Layoffs can be an unfortunate reality when businesses need to change their strategy or free up funds in an uncertain economy. But many workers say leaders at their business lack empathy when laying off employees, which can negatively impact how the workers who stay feel about their employer. Here’s how to show more empathy and keep a bad corporate situation from becoming worse. GameStop’s stock surged Monday morning after the White House’s X account reshared a post from the retailer and added an AI-generated picture of President Donald Trump looking like a character from which video game? A. Minecraft B. Super Mario Bros C. Halo D. World of Warcraft See if you got the answer right here.

Title: Answerman - Are Subtitles Getting Smaller?

A Reader asks: No, it's not your eyes. I have often thought the same thing, after my own traumatic experience managing the UK home video campaign of Evangelion: 3.33: You (Cannot) Release. Sorry! What? That's not the film's real title? You could've fooled me. That particular anime release was delayed by almost two years as Studio Khara insisted on supervising the re-recording of the English dub and the re-translation of the original Japanese audio and subtitles. A process they directly oversaw, which resulted in the DVD and Blu-ray release containing two "studio-approved" subtitle options. I remember one of the subtitle streams being so wordy that I thought they had to reduce the font size to fit it all on screen. As a regular anime viewer, I am not surprised to receive this question. Anime fans are a particular species when it comes to attention to detail, and subtitling is actually one of the major impediments to enjoying the medium if you cannot speak or understand Japanese. When it comes to the quality of subtitling, all is not as it may seem at first, especially if you're a Crunchyroll subscriber watching the Fall 2025 season. But we'll get to that crisis in a moment. First, let's address your main concern about whether subtitles are actually getting smaller. The Technical Answer: Your TV Is Lying To You Good news! Dr. ANSWERMAN has run some checks, and I am pleased to inform you that you haven't contracted syphilis or any of the hundreds of serious infections that can lead to permanent loss of sight. I've done the research, and it isn't you; it's your Smart TV. According to subtitle experts, standard font sizes have not, in fact, been getting smaller; however, display resolution and pixel density have been increasing dramatically over time. What this means in practice is that the higher your TV's resolution, the smaller the font size will appear, even though the actual point size hasn't changed. A subtitle that looks perfectly readable on a 1080p display can seem tiny on a 4K screen with the same physical dimensions. Higher pixel densities can help alleviate this challenge, but as we're about to discuss, don't rely on Crunchyroll to rise to that challenge. There's a reason "Subs" always won during the great Anime Wars of the early 2000s, whenever the "Subs Versus Dubs" debate would reignite over tequila-soaked trestle tables at regional anime conventions and on messageboards around the early social media landscape. The answer? Fansubs and Home Video Standards. DVDs and Blu-rays were the primary means of distributing and delivering a premium anime viewing experience to fans. Physical media traditionally featured larger, more readable subtitles with full closed captioning, superior typesetting, and careful attention to on-screen text translation. If you watch Anime A on Blu-ray or DVD, the subtitle font genuinely does appear larger on screen than it does on a Crunchyroll or Netflix stream. However! My simply writing anything complimentary about the subtitle quality on commercial Blu-rays has likely marked me for death. Many of the OG fansubbers pride themselves on their subtitling skills and the overall quality of their work. The fansub community developed incredibly sophisticated techniques for subtitle presentation, using tools and formats that went far beyond what commercial releases offered at the time. “Your S.R.T. can kiss my A.S.S.” This topic has taken me down wormholes I never wanted to visit. Take this one, for example: even fansubbers and professional subtitlers can't agree on what is the best software, file format, or font for subtitling. Many subbers swear by ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) format and believe it should be the anime industry standard because it allows for custom fonts, colors, text positioning, and animation effects. ASS enables multiple speakers to be displayed simultaneously in different positions on screen, on-screen text to be translated and positioned exactly where it appears in the scene, and visual styling that makes subtitles feel integrated into the viewing experience rather than slapped on top. By contrast, SRT (SubRip) is a simple, plain-text subtitle format; no styling, no positioning, just text and timecodes. It's the universal standard used by Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and nearly every streaming service. It's simpler to produce, easier to scale across platforms, and compatible with every device under the sun. It's also, unfortunately, what Crunchyroll has switched to for their Fall 2025 season. The tool that made ASS subtitles possible for Crunchyroll was Aegisub - a free, open-source, cross-platform application for creating and editing subtitles. Originally developed for fansubbing, Aegisub became the professional standard for anime localization because of its advanced features and customization options. Users can translate, time, and style subtitles using powerful tools, then export them in various formats. It was Crunchyroll's secret weapon, the tool that let them deliver fansub-quality subtitles at a commercial scale. One thing that the recent subtitling crisis reveals is that Sony seems to be moving away from using the Aegisub system preferred by fansubbers and Crunchyroll's original production and operations team since the platform's inception. And one has to wonder if that is a wise move for the world's favorite anime streamer? Crisis on Infinite Subtitles! When I started writing this column, it was going to be a short and sweet explanation about high-resolution LED TV screens and monitors, but the events of the past few weeks could not go without comment. According to Anime By The Numbers, there's been a noticeable downgrade in typesetting and visual quality for the new Fall 2025 anime simulcast. The first episode of My Hero Academia: Final Season launched without any English language option. SPY x FAMILY Season 3 was delayed by hours. Multiple shows launched late, some with no subtitles at all, others with only Portuguese or Thai options. As of writing, many of these issues seem to have been rectified, but not before Reddit user mudda-hello documented the changes, including Crunchyroll's signature typesetting. Multiple overlapping speakers were no longer represented at different positions on screen. The bold fonts with colored strokes designed for visual clarity had vanished. On-screen text was either untranslated or stacked clumsily on top of dialogue. Imagine watching an anime where a character holds up a sign with crucial plot information. Previously, that text would be translated and positioned right on the sign. Now? The translation appears as generic white text at the bottom, completely covering the character's dialogue happening simultaneously. You have to choose: read the sign or read what they're saying. You can't have both. What Actually Happened While Crunchyroll's official statement blames "internal system problems," leaked reports paint a very different picture. According to sources, the majority of Crunchyroll's subtitling staff had been using Aegisub, the open-source software beloved by the fansubbing community. Recently, however, everyone was forced to abandon it and switch to cloud-based software called OOONA, a complete, proprietary system developed by an Israeli company. Many staff members were reportedly very upset about the decision, particularly coming so soon after major layoffs in August that gutted the localization and operations teams. It is important to point out that OONA is fast-becoming an industry favorite. Global production and digital broadcasting behemoth, ITV (Love Island), has recently integrated it because it is a robust industry-grade tool for managing large volumes of subtitles. David Padmore, ITV's Director of Accessibility, commented: “We chose OOONA because the team really understands our access services and localization workflows, and the platform supports these off the shelf.” Padmore also emphasized that OOONA lets ITV “make good use of AI and automation developments within a secure environment” as part of improving their production processes. However! ITV is not a global anime streaming platform, and one could fairly argue that the type of programming they deliver, reality formats, scripted dramas, game shows, etc, does not require the same level of bespoke subtitling that each anime series does. OOONA, founded in 2012 and headquartered in Tel Aviv, specializes in cloud-based software for translation and localization. It's also used by Netflix and Disney+, services that have never prioritized anime-specific subtitle styling. The software reportedly uses AI tools for various tasks like speech editing and video localization, though Crunchyroll has not confirmed its use of OOONA and denies any changes to its subtitle creation process. The timing is damning. The August layoffs included some of Crunchyroll's longest-serving employees, people who had been with the company since its fansub roots, who understood why anime subtitling requires special attention. Then, right as the fall season launches, arguably the biggest anime season of 2025, with the final season of My Hero Academia, SPY x FAMILY Season 3, and One Punch Man Season 3, things fall apart. Crunchyroll's official response to Anime News Network stated: "Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems, not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors, or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved." The community isn't buying it. When Reddit users contacted customer support, they received similarly vague responses about "technical and software issues" causing subtitles to "appear differently," with assurances that this "was not an intentional downgrade." After massive fan backlash, Crunchyroll reverted the subtitle font to their previous style, suggesting this wasn't a bug at all, but a deliberate change that they subsequently walked back when the outcry became too loud. Proper typesetting is crucial for deaf and hard-of-hearing fans, as well as viewers with visual impairments. Crunchyroll's previous subtitle style used bold fonts with colored strokes specifically for visual clarity. The new generic white text is significantly harder to read. This comes after Crunchyroll's ongoing failure to provide closed captioning for most English dubs, a problem that's persisted for years despite competitors offering CC as standard. When Crunchyroll absorbed Funimation, many English dubs that previously had closed captions lost them. For over a decade, Crunchyroll used subtitle formats that let translators be creative with how text appeared on screen. On-screen signs blended naturally into scenes. Text messages showed up translated where they belonged. Multiple speakers could be tracked easily. It made the shows better to watch, and for a moment, that was all gone. Reincarnated as a Streaming Service: I Have Overpowered Market Share, But My Subtitles Are Trash It's easy to dump on The Man, but from a purely business perspective, Crunchyroll might actually be making the "right" decision. Even though it hurts fans. Crunchyroll doesn't just stream anime directly to subscribers anymore. They sub-license major titles to Netflix (Solo Leveling, Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle), Disney+ (My Hero Academia), and other platforms. They're available as a channel through Amazon Prime Video and YouTube TV. All of these distribution partners require standardized subtitle formats that work across dozens of different apps, devices, and platforms. In some of their fastest-growing markets, the app is distributed via Netflix and Disney+, which aren't going to accommodate Crunchyroll's special ASS format files. They want industry-standard SRT that slots seamlessly into their existing infrastructure. Additionally, Crunchyroll is rapidly expanding into new international markets like Brazil, Mexico, India, and Indonesia, where they need to produce subtitles in multiple languages simultaneously. From an operations perspective, standardizing on the same tools and formats that every other streaming service uses makes scaling much easier and cheaper. But Crunchyroll isn't like any other streaming service, and its subscribers aren't like any other media consumer. They're supposed to be the anime-first platform, the one that understands what makes this medium special. As one industry analyst noted, "If Crunchyroll stops doing typesetting work, for most anime, it will simply cease to exist. The viewing experience for the typical anime fan will go down." With anime making up just 4-5% of Netflix's total viewership and an even smaller share of Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video, those platforms will never optimize the viewing experience for anime. They can't justify the investment. But Crunchyroll's entire business model is built on being the definitive anime platform. When they abandon what made them special, what's left? Understandably, Sony might stumble while rapidly scaling into new markets that lack decades of anime localization infrastructure, but it isn't as if they didn't acquire almost every single successful Western anime distribution business of the past 30 years, either. Surely! They have the largest international braintrust for the global anime distribution and monetisation at their disposal. Don't they? Where have all of their anime experts gone? What Sony seems to misunderstand is that selling anime to anime fans is not like other tech-based product services. They are detail-oriented people. They notice when fonts change. They care about on-screen text translation. They built the fansub community that Crunchyroll originally displaced. And yes, they can be pernickety pains in the ass, but you can't treat them like passive Netflix consumers. The subtitle crisis of Fall 2025 is about more than typesetting. It's about whether the world's dominant anime streaming platform will honor the community that built it, or whether, as with so many tech platforms before it, growth and profit will trump everything else.

Executives ask me how to build trust in technology that seems to move faster than people can adapt to it. In the end, both groups are really asking the same thing: Which skills matter most in an economy where machines can learn? To answer this, I analyzed data from two surveys my colleagues and I conducted over this summer. For the first, the Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, we asked 550 companies across the country how they use and invest in AI. For the second, the College Hiring Outlook Survey, we looked at how 470 employers viewed entry-level hiring, workforce development and AI skills in candidates. These studies show both sides of the equation: those building AI and those learning to work with it. More than half of organizations told us that AI now drives daily decision-making, yet only 38% believe their employees are fully prepared to use it. This gap is reshaping today’s job market. AI isn’t just replacing workers; it’s revealing who’s ready to work alongside it. Our data also shows a contradiction. While many companies now depend on AI internally, only 27% of recruiters say they’re comfortable with applicants using AI tools for tasks such as writing resumes or researching salary ranges. In other words, the same tools companies trust for business decisions still raise doubts when job seekers use them for career advancement. Until that view changes, even skilled workers will keep getting mixed messages about what “responsible AI use” really means. In the Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, this readiness gap showed up most clearly in customer-facing and operational jobs such as marketing and sales. These are the same areas where automation is advancing quickly, and layoffs tend to occur when technology evolves faster than people can adapt. At the same time, we found that many employers haven’t updated their degree or credential requirements. They’re still hiring for yesterday’s resumes while, tomorrow’s work demands fluency in AI. The problem isn’t that people are being replaced by AI; it’s that technology is evolving faster than most workers can adapt. Our research suggests that the skills most closely linked with adaptability share one theme, what I call “human-AI fluency.” This means being able to work with smart systems, question their results and keep learning as things change. Across companies, the biggest challenges lie in expanding AI, ensuring compliance with ethical and regulatory standards and connecting AI to real business goals. These hurdles aren’t about coding; they’re about good judgment. In my classes, I emphasize that the future will favor people who can turn machine output into useful human insight. I call this digital bilingualism: the ability to fluently navigate both human judgment and machine logic. What management experts call “reskilling” – or learning new skills to adapt to a new role or major changes in an old one – works best when people feel safe to learn. In our Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, organizations with strong governance and high trust were nearly twice as likely to report gains in performance and innovation. The data suggests that when people trust their leaders and systems, they’re more willing to experiment and learn from mistakes. In that way, trust turns technology from something to fear into something to learn from, giving employees the confidence to adapt. According to the College Hiring Outlook Survey, about 86% of employers now offer internal training or online boot camps, yet only 36% say AI-related skills are important for entry-level roles. Most training still focuses on traditional skills rather than those needed for emerging AI jobs. The most successful companies make learning part of the job itself. They build opportunities to learn into real projects and encourage employees to experiment. I often remind leaders that the goal isn’t just to train people to use AI but to help them think alongside it. This is how trust becomes the foundation for growth, and how reskilling helps retain employees. In my view, the companies leading in AI aren’t just cutting jobs; they’re redefining them. To succeed, I believe companies will need to hire people who can connect technology with good judgment, question what AI produces, explain it clearly and turn it into business value. In companies that are putting AI to work most effectively, hiring isn’t just about resumes anymore. What matters is how people apply traits like curiosity and judgment to intelligent tools. I believe these trends are leading to new hybrid roles such as AI translators, who help decision-makers understand what AI insights mean and how to act on them, and digital coaches, who teach teams to work alongside intelligent systems. Each of these roles connects human judgment with machine intelligence, showing how future jobs will blend technical skills with human insight. That blend of judgment and adaptability is the new competitive advantage. The future won’t just reward the most technical workers, but those who can turn intelligence – human or artificial – into real-world value.

Xbox’s President of Game Content and Studios, Matt Booty, sat down in an interview with The New York Times and explained Microsoft’s expanding multiplatform push, which came out just as it was announced that Halo Studio’s remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, now known as Halo: Campaign Evolved, is coming to PlayStation 5. In the interview, he commented on the cross-platform shift, stating that consumers no longer have an attachment to the devices or platforms on which they play games, unlike previous generations, when players typically sided with Xbox, PlayStation, or PC. He said, “We are all seeking to meet people where they are. Our biggest competition isn’t another console… We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.” When asked about the widespread layoffs, crossing the 9000 mark, Booty answered with a brief response, “Layoffs are difficult. They are part of managing our business.” Xbox’s multiplatform shift continues, with former exclusives like Grounded and Sea of Thieves already available on PlayStation. Similarly, other Xbox exclusives, such as Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, Forza Horizon 5, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, have finally launched on PlayStation 5 after their Xbox and PC releases. Up next on the catalog of Xbox games coming to PS5 is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, which launches on December 8, 2025, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, the Unreal Engine remake of the original 2001 cult-classic Halo title. The Halo series has driven sales across four generations of Xbox consoles, reportedly generating over $10 billion in revenue and shipping over 81 million units globally, with Halo 3 selling the most units in the series, at almost 14.5 million copies on the Xbox 360. However, it’s speculated that Xbox is aggressively pursuing this multi-platform push to increase its revenue goals. Earlier, a Bloomberg report revealed that Microsoft pushed its Xbox division for “30% accountability margins”, higher than the industry average between 17% and 22%. These well-above-industry-norm revenue targets subsequently led to the layoff of thousands of employees over the years, the cancellation of numerous high-profile projects across multiple studios, and price hikes for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service.
