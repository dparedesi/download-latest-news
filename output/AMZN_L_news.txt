Title: Do We Need to Interview Candidates In Person Again?

Interviewing I help hiring teams improve speed & quality. Ex-Amazon, Ex-Expedia. September 11, 2025 Are we about to go full circle and return to in-person interviews for most salaried roles? COVID pushed us to remote, Zoom-based interviews. Emerging tech then allowed employers to leverage AI to prompt interviewers on questions to use to interview humans. And now those candidates are responding by using AI to ace interviews. Which has caused folks like me to push TA leaders to get out ahead of this. Especially because some employers are even encouraging candidates to use AI during the interviewing process. If everyone is using AI, how will we know what a candidate can actually do? Does it matter if they need AI to do great work, as long as it’s great work? Will the future be bot-on-bot action, with employer AI agents screening and interviewing candidate bots? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that some companies are going old school, returning to in-person interviews, mostly because they’re fearful of hiring someone who’s aced the interview only because they have help from AI. 1. Based on my conversations with heads of TA, candidate use of AI is about 80% of the pull to return to in-person interviews. With the rising risk of candidate fraud — especially AI-assisted identity fraud and cheating — companies like Google and Deloitte are starting to prioritize in-person live interviews over remote video interviews. If you’re just getting up to speed on the risks, check out some of my previous articles here: 2. Another small reason for the return to in-person interviews — maybe 15% — is related to the big shift back to in-office work. Several TA leaders I spoke with said in-person interview requests are being driven somewhat by a need for a realistic job preview and an improved opportunity to connect with and sell candidates. In-person allows the candidate to meet the team in person, see the office and learn about their commute pattern, and experience the culture. 3. The third reason — maybe explaining just 5% of the pull — is related to beliefs that 1) soft skills and motivation are even more important to predicting success in a world where most knowledge is just a quick ChatGPT prompt away and that 2) human interviewers can better evaluate those soft skills in person, sitting across from the candidate. I think most of us have mixed feelings on this. The table below outlines the pros and cons of live, in-person interviews: The good news? Companies are 100% prepared for this shift back to in-person interviews. Just kidding. Most of us are not ready. In fact, because of the uncertain economy, recruiter and recruiting coordinator layoffs, more reliance on assessment-related tech to interview, and generally slower hiring, candidate experience and interviewer capabilities have not improved in the past three years. In fact, if you talk to candidates and hiring managers in focus groups as my team does, they’ll often say it’s gotten worse. What do we need to do if you and your business leaders decide to return to in-person interviews as the norm? 1. Training: We need to ensure our hiring teams are trained, not just in behavioral interviewing, legal risks, biases, and process. They also need to be aligned on your company’s new hard and soft skill needs — AI is disrupting a lot of jobs, so a more prescriptive weighting and shared philosophy on what’s trainable and what’s not will be key to selecting the right talent. For some companies, that’ll mean a smaller weighting on hard skills and a bigger emphasis on soft skills like curiosity, empathy, learning agility, building trust, influence/gaining buy-in, problem-solving, and communication skills. For others, that’ll mean a bigger focus on the expert skills and smaller focus on the supporting skills - and unfortunately, expert skills and soft skills are harder to evaluate than the supporting skills that AI will likely take over. 2. Candidate experience: Take advantage of the in-person interview to create a better candidate experience. In-demand candidates still need to be sold, even if it’s an employer’s market. Show off that expensive real estate, go old school and set up a non-interview lunch with the team, and get an executive to jump in and wow them with insights into your company’s compelling future. Some of us might need to rebuild the muscles around creating a great candidate experience for interviewed candidates, which includes excellent preinterview instructions on what to expect, a nice “we’re expecting you” greeting with reception/security, on-time, prepared interviewers, and excellent communication and expectation setting on next steps. This focus on CX might even bring us back to hiring recruiting coordinators. 3. Scheduling: Place advance holds on busy interviewer and hiring manager calendars for in-office interviews and same-day hiring decisions. We need speed to get quality, so don’t let in-person interviews cause you to miss out on top talent. 4. Identity verification: Ensure you have a mechanism to ensure that the person you screened over Zoom is the same person who shows up for your in-person interviews. Identity fraud — where someone uses AI or another interviewer to complete and pass the pre–onsite interview screen and assessments — is a bigger problem than it used to be. Talk to your HR and security team about the rigor needed to verify identity. 5. Talent advising: Train your recruiters to move from transactional process owners to true Talent Advisors. The business needs us in TA to level up the role we play in interviewing and selection given the renewed prioritization on quality of hire. Check out these free resources I’ve pulled together on how to be a Talent Advisor. And if you’re going to LinkedIn Talent Connect in San Diego in October, sign up for one of my sessions on quality of hire and reducing candidate fraud. 6. Leverage AI: Use generative AI to help your hiring teams translate job description language and your company-wide values/behaviors into hiring criteria, interview focus areas, interview questions, and good answer rubrics. But don’t just trust generic AI content on interviewing — your company may have a very different hiring approach than the median content AI has been trained on. Be sure to review what AI generates and correct anything that’s not in line with the business VP’s goals around what she wants her org makeup to look like in two to three years. Too often, TA has seen the middle-funnel work of interviewing and selection as something the business designs and leads independently. In fact, I’d argue most recruiting teams play a very small role between screened-candidate presentation and the post-interview decision action items (offer or decline). That needs to change. The risks associated with AI, the cost of bad hires, and the significant time investment around hiring requires us to lead more around the middle of the funnel. This starts with leading a conversation with the business around the pros and cons of remote interviews, asynchronous assessments, AI, and in-person interviews. Are you seeing a shift in your org to in-person interviews? Just for key roles, just for salaried corporate roles, just for executive hiring? I’ll post this article on my personal LinkedIn feed, and I’d love it if you’d share your plans and the why for your approach to interviewing in 2025 and beyond.

Title: If the AI Industry Fails, It Could Take the Rest of Us Down With It

Don't let AI critics tell you it's good for nothing: the amount of money being spent on AI infrastructure is so enormous that it’s literally propping up the US economy. The drawback, of course, is that if the AI industry fails, it could drag the rest of the economy down with it. In 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an incredible 24 percent — what the investment firm Charles Schwab understatedly called a "very good year." Since 2023, nearly half the growth was clustered in just a handful of tech stocks known as the "magnificent seven": Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple. And as the Atlantic recently noted, the companies most heavily involved in the AI boom have yet to see that success manifest in anywhere except the stock market. Though Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla are expected to have spent some $560 billion on AI development by the beginning of next year, their collective revenue from AI comes in at a paltry $35 billion. In the first half of 2025, the Atlantic notes, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth in the United States than all consumer spending combined. This revenue gap is the key crisis facing the tech industry — and the broader economy — in their quest to build an AI future. Thanks to roundly horrible performance in actual workplace environments, revenue remains illusive for the vast majority of AI deployments. Still, managers across industries are being pressured to show financial gains from the tech, even when the software isn’t delivering. That’s causing companies to do some creative accounting with their staff, laying off workers or slowing down hiring to inflate AI’s numbers. As the Atlantic highlights, this is leading to the very real possibility of a rupture forming in the broader economy, where companies induce rounds of layoffs to satisfy executives, without anything to show for it in the bottom line. In other words, we’re barreling toward a future where unemployment could rise while productivity takes a nosedive — dramatically slowing the economy as a result. That scenario isn’t exactly unprecedented. The computer boom of the 1980s took a similar turn, when early email software prompted executives to lay off secretaries and typists, resulting in specialized white collar workers actually spending more time sending emails than on their typical roles. "Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite," computer scientist Cal Newport told the Atlantic. "I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI." There’s just one crucial difference: email isn’t propping up half the stock market.

Title: 13 Ways To Future-Proof Your Career From Layoffs In 2025

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You’ve seen the headlines. The U.S. labor market isn’t as optimistic as we would like to believe. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ revised data points to a significant reduction in the number of jobs available from last year to March 2025. The economy is almost a million jobs weaker than we thought. And to add to this, August’s Jobs Report points to an increasingly weakening job market, with the unemployment rate at 4.3%--the highest level since 2021--and just 22,000 jobs added to the market in August, in sharp contrast to economists’ expectations of more than 70,000 job gains in the U.S, reports CNN. The primary industries being hit with employment reductions and fewer jobs being added to the market, are: (Data taken from the BLS employment situation summary.) Can the U.S. job market get any worse? There are several factors that are likely responsible for the current state of the labor market in the United States. These factors include the federal employment upheaval under the current administration, beginning in January when federal workers were prohibited to work remotely, resulting in a wave of employees leaving their jobs as expected in a bid from DODGE to shrink the federal workforce, and consequently government spend. Another likely reason is the shutdown and reduction of workforces in various federal departments, again linked to DODGE. Third, this year we’ve seen the tariff war impacting industries, especially manufacturing and wholesale trade, within the United States. AI is another significant factor here, resulting in fewer jobs being added to the labor market as a whole. One million less jobs than predicted aligns perfectly with the layoffs trend we've been seeing over the past few years, specifically since the AI boom. This year, in February, we saw an unprecedented surge in tech layoffs not seen since the pandemic, and since then tech layoffs have exceeded the rate of layoffs since the pandemic. Big name companies like Microsoft, Intel, Glassdoor, Indeed, and others have been laying off workers by the hundreds and thousands. Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO, said that AI is already achieving 50% of the work at the CRM company, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a future where AI will be more significantly integrated across the company’s operations and there will be fewer Amazon employees within the next few years. All these factors explain why the U.S. labor market is much weaker than originally forecasted. With a weak U.S. jobs market, it’s only natural that professionals like you are filled with anxiety. This is giving rise to the trend of job-hugging, which is the opposite of job-hopping that occurred during the Great Resignation of 2022. “Job-hugging” is when you hold on to your job and are very reluctant to hand in your notice for fear that you may never step into regular employment again. You don’t like your job, you probably hate it, and you don’t give it 100%, but you're staying in it just to survive. Is that what you really want for your future? Is this how you expect to live the rest of your career, at the mercy of inflation, tariffs, rising record levels of unemployment, fewer jobs being available, and fierce job market competition? Is that how you intend to spend the next 10, 15, 20 or 25 years of your career? Surely, there must be more to work than job-hugging or being at the mercy of the economy. The good news is you don’t have to be. Here are some simple steps you can take today to regain control over your life, your finances and your career, and design a job and career that makes you fulfilled, happy, and financially free. Upskill in the skills of the future, by learning the certifications that teach in-demand high-income skills, like AI, critical thinking, data analysis, project management, etc. Make a career pivot and shift to industries or roles that are recession-proof and pay well, such as cybersecurity, for example. Establish your digital presence and build your online personal brand. Offer your skills on freelance platforms, such as Toptal, Upwork, or Contra, so that you have a secondary stream of income to fall back on. And you can build an entire business from this, if it takes off and is going very well. Create a portfolio career where you have several income streams, including passive income. Look for remote jobs that are work-from-anywhere. Seek companies based in Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world, that have flexible hiring policies, and allow for async working from anywhere in the world. Strengthen your LinkedIn presence by optimising your profile, strategically adding to your network, and engaging thoughtfully on posts on LinkedIn, providing quality insight and thought leadership. Post regularly on LinkedIn, at least two to three times a week. Refresh your resume at least once a year, so you never forget what you've achieved and accomplished, and your resume is always fresh and prepared in the event that you need it sooner than expected. Build a financial cushion of emergency savings and money for business investment. So you can launch a side hustle. Leverage your brain capital for consulting and contract retainer work. Stay abreast of trends in your industry and in the job market, using podcasts, newsletters, industry publications, and attending industry networking events and masterminds. Join membership associations within your industry for networking and job opportunities. Focus on roles that require strategy, leadership, and decision-making, as opposed to entry-level or repetitive skills that AI can easily replicate. What’s next for you now? Time to dust off your resume and optimize it for the jobs and skills of the future. Learn how to Write A Resume That Gets You Hired After A Layoff, then after reading that article, learn what you can do in the first month after being laid off here. Then, check out some free certifications you can undertake to upskill yourself at no cost in this article.

Title: Progress Report: Saks Global Execs Talk Integrations, Plans and Opportunities
URL: http://wwd.com/business-news/retail/saks-global-give-progress-report-on-neimans-integration-1238127047/
Time Published: 2025-09-09T20:42:04Z

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Growth with Amazon overseas, reducing over-assortments, reviving the Saks flagship's holiday light show, and digging into the data to differentiate from competitors are on the agenda. Senior Editor, Retail Saks Global’s $2.7 billion takeover of the Neiman Marcus Group hasn’t been easy and has kept many vendors on edge. But in a media briefing Tuesday morning at Bergdorf Goodman, Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, along with Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer, and Tracy Margolies, president of Bergdorf Goodman, outlined progress, as they see it, in the integration, as well as opportunities for the future. Combining the Saks and Neiman’s merchandising and marketing teams into a single organization, from a human capital perspective, is “wholly done,” Metrick said. “They’ve largely been integrated, though there’s always work to do.” He said there’s about a 50-50 split with half the team coming from Neiman’s and half from Saks. Related Articles Fashion Features Saks Celebrates New York Fashion Week With Cocktail Event at Le Chalet in L'Avenue Fashion Scoops Neiman Marcus Leans Into Elegance for Fall Campaign Data will be key to differentiating from competitors, Metrick emphasized. “We’ve got data on 30 million luxury consumers. We have 700 million visits to our website and record every move that customers make. We understand more and more about this luxury consumer.” You May Also Like Inventory sharing between Saks and Neiman’s will be another competitive advantage, he said. “It’s going to start with online fulfillment, and then it’s going to move into the stores. So you’re looking at every customer that walks into a Saks or Neiman’s store, any size they want, any color they want, any designer they want, anything they want that we have, you’ll have access to.” On store closures, “There’s probably an opportunity to rationalize our fleet,” though it wouldn’t be based on the integration of Saks and Neiman’s, Metrick said. “What you’ll see over the next couple of years is an ordinary course type of closings — nothing on a large scale.” In a past interview, Metrick projected fewer than 10 closings. Already, Saks in Palm Beach closed, and Neiman’s in Dallas has an uncertain future, but remains open at least through the holiday season. Saks Global bought Neiman’s in December. Metrick suggested Saks Global stores have been seriously over-assorted. “I want us to return back to our roots of being that fashion arbiter, that authenticator. Customers have simply too much choice,” he said. “We figured out through hyper-personalization, the exact assortment of product [shoppers] would be interested in when they go onto saks.com. Everyone’s home page at saks.com is personalized. The bottom line is, we have to do more with less.” Saks Global is reducing its vendor matrix by 25 percent with some vendors leaving voluntarily while others are being dropped. Earlier this year, Saks Fifth Avenue launched a storefront on Amazon Luxury Stores, following Amazon’s investment in Saks’ purchase of Neiman’s. It’s a move aimed at boosting the revenues of Saks and some vendor partners, though it poses some risk to hurting the luxury image of Saks and the participating vendors. On the other hand, “There’s an international opportunity with Amazon,” Metrick said. “We’re not thinking about it for 2025 but more as we get into next year and the year after. Amazon is built ready for luxury, globally. There might be opportunities in specific regions and countries,” which could be enticing to brands. Metric acknowledged that much of the conversation surrounding Saks Global has been about late or non-payments to vendors. “I appreciate that and I’m aware it’s caused a lot of pressure and has resulted in noise,” Metrick said. Certain vendors continue to complain about overdue payments, but the CEO said: “We are largely in line with our payments with our brand partners. We need to move on from that part of the conversation and move towards saying, ‘Good news. We’re going to have $600 million in synergies, so now we can pay you.” The expected $600 million in annual savings will come through layoffs, consolidation of functions, and increased buying power over suppliers. Bergdorf Goodman maintains its own buying team, separate from the centralized Saks/Neiman’s organization. “They want to get paid, but that’s not going to excite them,” Metrick added, referring to vendors. “What’s going to excite them is [Saks Global] adding 50 percent of volume over the next five years, through knowing the customer, giving you more space, being more efficient with your inventory, better sell-throughs, and making it more special through events and activations.” While not disclosing any new financial results, Metrick suggested Saks Global is on sounder financial footing, noting the company recently closed on $600 million in financing through a bond exchange with existing holders. “There is north of $2 billion in bonds out there,” Metrick said. With more money available, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship holiday light show, which was canceled last year to the disappointment of the hundreds of thousands who crowd the streets to see the show each year, is being revived this year and will happen in November, Essner announced. Essner said new Saks Fifth Avenue shop on Amazon was launched “with the hypothesis there’s still an untapped luxury consumer we can access and serve on Amazon. We’ve really found that’s true. The vast majority are new customers, not [those] shopping Saks previously. We are selling true luxury. We’re selling very high price point handbags and dresses in a way that surprised us. And it’s early days. There’s a lot more to build here, but we feel very good with some of the early signals.” About 50 vendors launched with Saks on Amazon. The market has been curious on how Saks Global evolves Saks and Neiman’s and to the degree they differentiate. “We’re being very intentional about this,” Essner said. Saks Fifth Avenue is “really for the fashion enthusiast who is seeking originality, who views Saks Fifth Avenue as their partner in discovery. Neiman Marcus is really for a sophisticate who doesn’t settle.” In terms of items sold, there’s an over 60 percent overlap; the percentage is even higher in terms of brands. Also on Tuesday, Saks Global unveiled its latest Luxury Pulse Survey, which from July 17-21 queried 995 U.S. luxury consumers over age 18. Among the most optimistic of the findings, 56 percent of luxury consumers said they planned to spend the same or more on luxury in August, September and October, compared with the previous three months, representing a 9 percentage-point increase compared with the April survey and nearly flat compared to the same time last year. But that also means that 44 percent of luxury consumers plan to spend less. Whether that all translates into better business for Saks Global this fall depends on how much more, or less, shoppers spend. Saks surveys luxury consumers on a quarterly basis. Based on the July read, Saks does anticipate more spending through October, which Essner attributed to “a desire to treat themselves, which is something we hadn’t seen for a while, as well as feeling better about the overall economy, and their need to update their wardrobes. Some of that might be seasonal. Some of that might be the reality of the fashion coming up, but overall, those were very positive signs.” The survey also found that 32 percent of luxury consumers feel optimistic about the economy, up 4 percentage points compared with the April survey, but 13 percentage points lower than the same time last year. Fifty-nine percent of luxury consumers feel good about their personal finances, 8 percentage points above the April survey, but a 9 point decline from the same time last year. Asked about rising prices, Essner said luxury consumers “are very concerned about value.” That value can be inherent in the craftsmanship and in the design of the product, she said. “The luxury consumer is not necessarily concerned about price.” With tariffs impacting prices, Essner said: “Some brand partners are being thoughtful about their assortments. They’re being thoughtful about pricing, looking potentially in some places to introduce more entry price points as appropriate. In general, what we’re hearing from a tariff perspective is midsingle-digit price increases. That’s very much in line with the increases consumers have seen over the last few years and not going to necessarily stand out.” When querying luxury shoppers in July, Essner said tariffs were not hitting in a big way. “It was a little bit too soon to tell in terms of how, especially the luxury consumer, is going to react, because, frankly, the impact of tariffs isn’t something that they have seen. The bigger concern, the macroeconomic noise generated from all of the tariff discussion.” Looking ahead, Essner noted that recently the saks.com homepage became “a fully personalized experience. We will be taking that capability to neimanmarcus.com and bergdorfgoodman.com.” She also said over 60 percent of the luxury brands Saks Global carries are working on exclusives for the fall season. At Bergdorf Goodman, “We have over 120 events for this fall,” said Margolies. She also said Bergdorf’s, as part of improving its store experience, launched new shops for Tom Ford ready-to-wear and Dior beauty, and will launch a new Schiaparelli shop in the fourth quarter.

A project of Common Dreams Phoebe Trotter:ptrotter@fwwatch.org Report pulls punches on pesticide regulation as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation This afternoon the White House’s “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) Commission released its strategy report outlining the Trump administration’s priorities for policies to overhaul the food system and address chronic disease. In keeping with White House promises to monied industrial agriculture lobbyists, the report does not endorse increased regulation for toxic pesticides. Fully 71% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans support increasing restrictions on the use of pesticides in agriculture. The report comes as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation to shield pesticide manufacturers from health-related lawsuits. The Cancer Gag Act, expected to be reintroduced as the “Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act,” is reportedly a House Farm Bill priority; House Republicans included related language in a July appropriations vote to prevent EPA from improving pesticide warning labels. Meanwhile, the report makes only passing mention of PFAS – lab-made “forever chemicals” that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation and reduced vaccine response. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back previously-established protections for PFAS in drinking water through Lee Zeldin and the Environmental Protection Agency. In response to the release of the report, Food & Water Watch Senior Food Policy Analyst Rebecca Wolf issued the following statement: Food & Water Watch research catalogues pesticide giant Bayer’s multimillion dollar push for Cancer Gag legislation, introduced across the country, failing in nine states and passing in two (the bill is still pending in North Carolina). The push comes as Bayer has spent over $11 billion settling more than 100,000 cancer lawsuits related to its Roundup pesticide, whose key ingredient glyphosate the World Health Organization defines as a probable carcinogen. Food & Water Watch mobilizes regular people to build political power to move bold and uncompromised solutions to the most pressing food, water, and climate problems of our time. We work to protect people's health, communities, and democracy from the growing destructive power of the most powerful economic interests. One ACLU leader warned it "would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets." Eleven Democrats voted with Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Thursday to advance the so-called Stop Illegal Entry Act, which critics have condemned as "dangerously overbroad" as well as "dehumanizing and horrific." The final vote was 226-197. The 11 Democrats who joined all GOP members present in backing the bill were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Laura Gillen (NY), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (Mich.), Frank Mrvan (Ind.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Tom Suozzi (NY), and Gabe Vasquez (NM). One commentator noted that Brazil's Supreme Court "refused to cave to imperialist threats" from the Trump administration. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced to over 27 years behind bars Thursday after four of five Supreme Court justices on a panel voted to convict the far-right leader and seven associates of plotting a military coup and assassination of current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other officials. "This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present, and its future," said Justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, on Thursday cast the third and decisive vote to convict the former president and seven co-plotters, referring in part to the two decades of US-backed military dictatorship, during which Bolsonaro served as an army paratrooper. Health insurance premiums are expected to rise significantly for approximately 22 million Americans after Republicans ended a tax credit for those enrolled in programs under the Affordable Care Act. Democratic leaders said Thursday that they plan to hold up negotiations on a potential government shutdown unless Republicans agree to forfeit a policy change that is expected to dramatically raise health insurance premiums for millions of Americans. Health insurance premiums are expected to rise significantly for approximately 22 million Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans after Republicans refused to extend enhanced tax credits when passing Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in July.

The company is investing $80 billion in AI, but it faces criticism amid ongoing job eliminations in a shift towards automation.

This time, it’s not thousands of employees, but just over 40 roles in Redmond (via Seattle Times). Even so, it marks the fifth consecutive month of job cuts in 2025, bringing the total to more than 15,000 employees since Microsoft announced its $80 billion AI investment commitment. The question now is whether these smaller September layoffs signal a slowdown, or if Microsoft plans to continue trimming staff month after month to make way for its AI-powered future. Microsoft at least appears to be following a trend regarding its layoffs. The latest round in Redmond targeted engineering, product management, and legal roles at its headquarters. The cuts are far smaller than earlier rounds — 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July — but they still form part of Microsoft’s broader restructuring plan. This steady drip of layoffs suggests a deliberate effort to keep pressure on costs, even if the numbers are smaller. It raises an uncomfortable question: has Microsoft normalized monthly layoffs as part of its new way of operating? In 2025, Microsoft announced that $80 billion investment into AI — a $25 billion increase from the previous year. The money is going into data centers, custom chipsets, cloud expansion, and further development of tools like Copilot. Satya Nadella described this as the “enigma of success,” pointing to record profits but also the pressure to reduce costs. That tension is at the heart of recent criticism. The investment commitment came before the bulk of layoffs, creating frustration as Microsoft pushed ahead with massive spending while cutting thousands of jobs. At the same time, the company has been urging employees to rely more heavily on AI tools in their workflows. Microsoft also laid out 40 job roles at risk of being eliminated by AI. The layoffs also followed news that Microsoft had secured $6 billion in government savings over three years, adding to the perception that the cuts are less about financial necessity and more about long-term priorities. The bigger picture is clear: Microsoft is shifting resources to secure dominance in AI, not responding to immediate financial struggles. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Layoffs at Microsoft seem to be part of a bigger transformation, and it’s not all about saving money. Roles have been cut across key parts of the company, including Xbox, LinkedIn, engineering, legal, product management, research, support, and sales. At the same time, Microsoft is still hiring — but the focus has shifted. The company is bringing in talent for AI, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and Copilot development. Satya Nadella has even said that a portion of Microsoft’s code is now written by AI, and I’ve noticed a new role floating around online: “professional vibe code cleaners” (via LinkedIn). I’d like to think anyone using AI to write code at Microsoft can actually code themselves, or at least I hope so. To balance this shift, Microsoft is also investing in reskilling. Its $4 billion “Elevate” program aims to help millions of people prepare for jobs in the AI era, reflecting a longer-term vision of how the workforce will evolve. Any round of layoffs, especially at Microsoft’s scale, creates anxiety and uncertainty. A culture of fear and job insecurity can quickly take hold. On top of that, employees face the added pressure of learning new AI tools just as those same tools are replacing traditional roles — something that understandably leaves a sour taste. This isn’t unique to Microsoft. Amazon, Meta, Google, and others are making similar AI-driven cuts. Workflows across the industry are shifting as companies double down on automation and AI-powered systems. The September layoffs are not an isolated event, but part of a broader transformation. Microsoft, and the tech sector as a whole, is clearly prioritizing AI, even if that means reshaping work in ways that feel deeply unsettling for many employees.

Title: Why Can’t Oracle Afford Data Centers?

Read By Tl;dr – Oracle remains the x-axis of AI/cloud computing (but their revenue forecasts are geometric) Update: Oracle reported earnings yesterday, missing on both revenue and profit expectations and reporting slower growth than the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Free cash flow dropped deeper into the red. Oracle’s CAPEX spend dropped from $9.2 billion to $8.5 billion. But they announced they have signed contracts for nearly geometric increases in cloud revenue over the next five years, going from $10.3 billion in the last fiscal year (FY25) to $144 billion in FY30. The stock is up insanely as a result. The discussion of the CAPEX required to realize these revenue forecasts was minimal. Oracle guided to $35 billion in CAPEX for FY26 and threw around some words about how they’re “asset pretty light”. Oracle’s belief in magic beans abides. But no infrastructure, no revenue remains an iron law of the cloud world. Oracle still needs to come up with a lot of capital for CAPEX, amidst other demands for capital (dividends, buybacks to raise Larry’s stake, servicing debt). Oracle’s future is tied to Open AI. The vast majority of the forecasted revenue would come from Open AI. It isn’t clear how Open AI will find hundreds of billions to pay for infrastructure and all their other ambitions. The other customers referenced are neither big nor reliable revenue. xAI has no revenue, no prospects for real revenue, and is already turning to debt funding (plus borrowing from SpaceX). Meta has no business plan to pay for their ($600 billion and counting!) AI mulligan, but likely promised some very expensive employees they’d have GPUs to play with. NVIDIA and AMD paying Oracle for infrastructure is simply revenue recycling. Oracle still has to come up with the cash to play this game. They’re promised the revenue. Now they need to show us the CAPEX to realize that revenue. Update 2: WSJ confirms the vast majority of Oracle’s promised future revenue ($300 billion) would come from Open AI. Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on Open AI’s ability to raise hundreds of billions in more capital. Update 3: I just went ahead and wrote another post about Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Beyond bombastically scripted earnings calls, deploying CAPEX effectively and efficiently at scale takes place in a cold, hard reality. We’ve been chronicling Oracle’s difficulties building data centers at bonsai scale, never mind at hyperscale: Oracle (company slogan: “that’s not just a rack, it’s an entire region!”) has slowly increased its CAPEX spend, but at a pace that falls further and further behind the hyperCAPEX companies. Oracle’s first decent-sized data center, the oft-touted yet somehow still under construction project in Abilene, is well on its way to becoming the picture accompanying the dictionary definition of “construction site”. Partly it earns that status because it has taken so long, but also because that data center has so many mouths to feed (Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure, Lancium, Crusoe, Oracle, and Open AI are all laying claim to those construction photos). Oracle’s primary contribution seems to consist of yelling at the contractors. Oracle is “all-in” on their data center plans, and has expended enormous energy to get themselves referred to as a “hyperscaler”. But are they really in the hyperscaler club? Let’s see how Oracle stacks up with actual hyperscalers. This is a high-stakes financial game requiring gargantuan resources and a broad array of competencies. When it comes to the metrics, Oracle always seems to play the role of the x-axis (a joke I never tire of and Oracle never manages to break away from that gravitational pull). Let’s look at some proxies for financial prowess: Oracle is the revenue runt of their aspirational litter. By a lot. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is the runt, except for Meta who don’t have a cloud business. (One of the great mysteries of the universe is where Meta sees the return coming from its rapidly escalating infrastructure investment promises — $600 billion and counting!. Unlike our other contestants, they have no cloud services business and a checkered history serving developers. As with Elon, taking a dependency on Meta is high risk. Maybe Meta alone has glimpsed some new zero-to-one geyser of revenue that will pay for all those data centers? Regardless, and reluctantly returning to today’s topic at hand, Meta still has vastly more cash to play this game than Oracle). Three-for-three on runt status. Oracle does show leadership on one metric: the debt to equity ratio. They’re already carrying a much bigger debt load than their desired peer group, while also the company that could most use some credit. For free cash flow (cash flow minus CAPEX), Oracle is yet still again the runt. Oracle’s competitors are both spending much more on CAPEX and still have significant, positive free cash flow. And when we look at the most recent quarter, Oracle’s free cash flow went negative (-$394 million) as they ramped their CAPEX spend to (merely) $9 billion in the quarter. Now let’s look at CAPEX spending, that ultimate separator of clouds and clowns. Emphatically runty. Oracle is already more stressed with their (modest) CAPEX spend relative to revenue. Cumulative CAPEX spending gives us a sense of how much infrastructure a company has deployed. Amazon, AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft all spent more on CAPEX in the last year than Oracle has in the last decade, and all but Meta spent more last year on CAPEX than Oracle has in its entire fifty year existence. All of which is to say Oracle is both way behind in deployed infrastructure and playing with the smallest stack of chips in this game. Which brings me (at long last!) to my point: Oracle has hyped big revenue growth forecasts for the next couple years. In particular, they tout a deal with Open AI to bring in as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue by FY28 (we’ll ignore the question of why Microsoft decided it didn’t want this business and discarded it to Oracle). If you’re excited about the revenue opportunity in front of Oracle, you also have to grapple with the costs of the infrastructure necessary to deliver that revenue. No infrastructure, no revenue. No CAPEX, no infrastructure. So where does the money for data center CAPEX come from and what are the implications for Oracle’s free cash flow, debt load and/or margins? They need to step up from their current (modest) levels of spending which are already stressing the company’s financials. It is pretty clear Oracle is not very efficient in its CAPEX spend. They’ve been publicly demonstrating they are early on the learning curve, struggling to forecast CAPEX spending a quarter out, much less years out. They’re also in a big hurry, and there is a YOLO infrastructure cost premium. Some hardware is scarce (GPUs, gas turbines). Costs and wait times for both interconnection and hardware delivery have widened, while the hyperCAPEX companies are both bigger buyers and got in the queues earlier. End-to-end, Oracle lacks a manufacturing machine that turns dollars into data centers efficiently and effectively at scale. Over the last three years, Oracle has spent between $1 and $2 of CAPEX per dollar of cloud infrastructure revenue. AWS CAPEX historically has been between 25 to 60% of revenue (and is ramping back up as they deploy AI infrastructure). We could also model CAPEX spend based on the incremental revenue it drives (new capacity allows new revenue), which makes that $30 billion revenue dream even more expensive (and remember those GPUs are short-lived, especially if you’re chasing the pre-training market). It looks like Oracle is going to lean more on OPM (Other People’s Money or perhaps Oracle Pleads for Money) for its CAPEX spending. The data center build team was hit in the recent Oracle layoffs. The Abilene data center is already a layer cake of financial participants. Stargate was briefly the OPM salvation, but it has “struggled to get out of the gate”. Open AI finds itself doing party rounds for both cash and electricity, raising billions of dollars instead of trillions, and scavenging for megawatts rather than gigawatts. Maybe those notoriously charitable financial actors will accept lower returns just to partner with notoriously charitable Oracle? Going the OPM route negatively impacts Oracle margins, architectural control, and time-to-market. How do Oracle’s hyperscaler hopes and dreams get bankrolled?

Title: MicroCo Wants to Be the Alpha Werewolf Billionaire That Vertical Dramas Need

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Laugh at vertical dramas’ alpha werewolf pregnant billionaire storytelling all you want, but don’t let the giggling distract you. Vertical dramas are massive. For young filmmakers they offer a low-barrier entry point. For entrepreneurial producers, they’re a chance to become mini-mini moguls. In 2024 alone, over 36,000 new series launched. Already a $7 billion business in China, the market is projected to top $10 billion globally (outside China) by 2027. Last month, Cineverse — the folks who brought you “Terrifier” — and Lloyd Braun’s Banyan Ventures announced MicroCo, a new microseries studio and platform.

The ambition isn’t to be another ReelShort or DramaBox. It wants to be the Amazon Prime of vertical drama, producing originals and curating the best from thousands of existing titles. I spoke with Cineverse president and Chief Strategy Officer Erick Opeka about MicroCo’s ambitions and why he sees vertical dramas as the next inflection point. Full disclosure: I’m excited to see what happens with vertical dramas and I’m a little bit conflicted about that. This is filmmaking at its most disposable. For this format that’s a feature, not a bug. It’s storytelling that leans into the dopamine with cliffhangers every two minutes; logic and nuance are roadkill. China can’t create a $7 billion business without America taking notice, but we might be slower to respond if we weren’t living through a moment otherwise defined by layoffs, consolidation, and other forms of retreat (Neuehouse, RIP). Growth feels good. Like it or not, this is a ground floor — but not for long. My interview with Erick has been edited for brevity and clarity. In Development: When did vertical video first cross your desk? Erick Opeka: A couple of years ago. In another incarnation we were owned by a Chinese company, so we’ve always been keeping an eye on trends. It was starting to pop up around the same time TikTok started to take hold. I saw it start to be something we were interested in maybe about 18 months ago. What do you see as the potential for this? If you look at the evolution in China, it’s not just targeted toward women looking for romance. About 550 million people in China viewed vertical microdramas as of the summer of this year. It’s gotten so big that it’s stealing mindshare from the more legacy streaming services. It’s resonating with their daily use patterns and cadence and mobile-first society. The pattern we’re already seeing in the US — the very soapy stuff taking hold, becoming a billion-dollar business in the US, and the top apps beating out Netflix and Hulu and Disney in the app store in revenue generated — tells me over the next five years, you’re going to see that happen here. What’s compelling is there’s no ecosystem around this in the US today, even though it’s already a billion-dollar business. I hear anecdotal things, but there’s no PR channels, no IMDB for this stuff. And these things are like mayflies, right? They premiere, they get mined of their value in two to three weeks, and then they’re into the ether and it’s on to the next one. It kind of hearkens back to the early days of cinema and the nickelodeon, and there was no star system yet. You had the Biograph Girl. It parallels a lot of what you would see in the early development of a new medium. Our goal is to build out the Roku or Amazon Prime of the space for the US. The other opportunity is there’s a lot that are clearly not professionally produced storytelling. It’s not so much the production value, but how do you maximize the storytelling? Putting together a team like Susan, Lloyd, and Jana, they understand big, brash storytelling. We’re not coming in with any kind of hubris that we’re going to reinvent the format. The format works. It’s about going back to the basics and doing a better job with western-style storytelling for US audiences. How would you distribute this? You have to have your own app to be a credible player. We’re a tech company. I have the engineering team and staff. We operate hundreds of apps in the ecosystem, so this is not something that is unfamiliar to us. The other piece is what I’ve seen as TikTok evolved into a multi-platform media company. They have connected TV apps, they have smart TV apps. It’s growing quite fast. I didn’t think vertical video on a big TV was going to work, and it’s kind of working to some degree. It’s just weird. Maybe people want to use their phone to text and goof around, and these stories are light engagement. The other thing is if we serve as the Hulu or Amazon or whatever analogy you want to make, there is no catalog value to most of these things. [We’d be] aggregating them, providing the fan layer, providing the information so people can find them. We’d also be working with major media companies, mobile providers, and others to provide our app or create a custom version of the content. We’d also produce, much like Prime, a nice layer of premium things. A lot of people see the team we’re putting together and think this is somehow going to be some ludicrous overspending. It’s quite the opposite. It’s like a puzzle we’re all trying to solve: How do you do what is already being done, without spending much more, and just do it better than it’s being done? There’s no need to put A-list talent in a $250,000-produced micro drama. This audience isn’t going to resonate with that, anyway. I think microdramas are going to serve a two-way approach. One is IP that will graduate into bigger phenomenon, and bigger IP will make the format stay top of mind — rather than going to the movies two or three times a year for most Americans. But it’s got to graduate from Harlequin romance-style stuff. Don’t get me wrong, we’re going to play that up. If you saw the names of some of the shows we’re contemplating — we’re like, how do we one-up everybody at this game of just getting ridiculous with it? We’re going to have fun with it. Are you looking to produce, or is this going to be acquisitions of independents? What’s the plan there? It’s going to be a mix. We’re starting to see some companies and producers that are getting really good at this. Most are kind of outside the system [or] recent film school grads from top programs that have been trying to break in. They’ve gotten good at scaling and figuring out how to do it. Very entrepreneurial. Some of the top producers in the space have very little to no Hollywood background. These are all indies. Right? I interviewed one of the vertical filmmakers, Yun Xie. She was fascinating. She made a feature that won Slamdance. Really? Yeah. And she was awesome. She’s a powerhouse. I was so impressed by her energy. So many directors come off as brash. That’s not her, but she’s very clearly focused. You hit the nail on the head, right? If you look back to the ‘90s indie film world vibe of just how excited people were and they were excited to get up every day and try to figure out how to get their movie and just crack the space. There was a palpable excitement around it. I feel that same kind of energy. I agree. People feel like, not only do I have a shot to get things made and do things and move forward with something that’s fun, compelling and new, but there’s real money to be made. I mean, you got to make a lot more of them to make money, but the money that’s being spent in this space is not immaterial anymore. What kinds of budgets are you looking at? The numbers have been all over the board and a lot of it reflects the indie film world. Cheaper it is, the more sweat equity and favors are being called — they’re doing these for below six figures. The price point is settling anywhere between $150,000 and $400,000. There’s people who are starting to become known and those cost a little more. And just because it’s a white-hot space, there’s not a ton of experienced producers. Demand is outstripping the supply, driving up prices a little bit right now. How many do you think you’ll produce or release in a year? We’re still working on that number. We’re going for a little higher quality as opposed to quantity. I don’t think we’re going to be at the cadence of the top players that drop one microdrama a day. But maybe one a week. Maybe two a week, toward the back half of our first year. How are you going to handle payment? There’s this whole system of coins and you lose track of what you’re actually spending. “It’s just one more coin.” You add it up all up at the end and holy crap, I just spent $40. Yeah. This business was spawned out of gaming companies who use a lot of these techniques to unlock levels. Every two minutes, beginning, middle, end, cliffhanger. It’s designed to hook you in. It drives high levels of engagement. Early adopters have a willingness to pay a lot more money. [But] look at what happened in streaming to expand and get the last corners of everybody. You’ve had to launch a lot of ad-supported, subsidized, lower-price things because most people can’t afford to pay 40 bucks to watch a soapy microdrama. Apps have already started to develop subscription levels, which are equally expensive. $20 a week or $200 a year, which is insane when you think about it. Over time, this business starts to look more like traditional media, but I think the coin piece will always kind of be hanging around. They’ll probably just get cheaper. In China there’s a lot of pressure for this to be far more ad supported. You’ll see the same dynamics here. If someone produced a vertical independently, what is the price point that you’d be looking at to buy it? If it’s great it’s going to get the market rates, which are in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. If it’s experimental or they’re a new producer, it might be less than that. But this is [only] one opportunity. Normally filmmakers complain a lot about the rev share model. That’s feast-or-famine, [but] even moderately successful microdramas can make a lot of money. There’s a real opportunity for rev share on these. It’s like making a Netflix movie. You make it, you sell it, you bake in your profit margin and on to the next one. But if people get really good at it, if they build their own franchises, if they have their own characters, You’re going to see exactly what’s evolved in traditional entertainment economics: They’re going to demand [rev share] and they’re going to get it. A detailed statistical analysis of one of the biggest questions looming over every young cinephile’s mind: Do I need to go to film school? Whatever you think of the term “NonDē” as a replacement for “independent” — I see the logic, but find it aesthetically hideous and overcomplicated — this is an insightful article about the evolving role of film festivals for filmmakers who accept that the game has changed. Another data-driven story that serves as a nuanced counterpoint to the adage that Hollywood is completely run by sequels. That’s still largely true, of course, but Thomson offers a deep dive into the level of performance required for a film to receive a larger investment for a sequel. It’s a pessimistic take on the larger state of the traditional film industry, but those seem to be the only honest ones. A nuts-and-bolts roundup of high quality advice for anyone wrestling with the question “how do I become a director?” Horton offers a healthy mix of old advice that has maintained its relevance in a changing world and newer tips that feel fresh today, but anyone looking to launch a filmmaking career could do a lot worse than using this as a primer. Writing for the Business of TV Substack, Topping offers another potential explanation for the surge in vertical drama popularity: the medium is becoming the only place to enjoy the kind of romantic melodrama that used to be readily available on bigger screens. It’s a thoughtful analysis of an age-old phenomenon: when the larger entertainment industry stops serving a popular product, somebody else will inevitably emerge to fill the void.

Title: The Cost Of Living The American Dream For A Lifetime Has Reached A Whopping 5 Million Dollars

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world has happened to us? When I was growing up, it was assumed that pretty much everyone in my generation would be able to achieve the American Dream. But today most of the U.S. population is not living the American Dream, and more people are falling out of the middle class every day. As I have detailed in previous articles, this is particularly true for Millennials and those in Generation Z. The collective prosperity of the middle class has been declining for an extended period of time, and now that long-term decline threatens to become a full-blown avalanche. Borrowing money always creates pain, and since 2009 our leaders in Washington have borrowed and spent 27 trillion dollars that we did not have. Pumping all of that extra money into the system has had very serious consequences, because now the purchasing power of our dollars has been greatly diminished. In fact, Newsweek is reporting that the cost of living the American Dream for a lifetime has now reached 5 million dollars… The American Dream has long symbolized the promise of opportunity, prosperity, and upward mobility. Coined in 1931 by writer James Truslow Adams in The Epic of America, the term described “that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.” But nearly a century later, achieving that vision is more expensive than ever. According to new research published by Investopedia, the lifetime cost of attaining the traditional American Dream—including homeownership, retirement, raising children, a wedding, new cars, healthcare, pets, and annual vacations—now totals roughly $5 million. These calculations assume a college-educated, dual-income household capable of sustaining these ambitions over a lifetime. Is your household going to bring in 5 million dollars over the course of your lifetime? Sadly, most U.S. households don’t have a prayer of getting anywhere even close to that. But if you want to live the American Dream for an entire lifetime, that is what it is going to take. We live at a time when virtually everything is steadily becoming more expensive. In a previous article, I explained that each month an average family of four spends $996 on groceries, $1,437 on health insurance, $745 on a vehicle payment and $2,259 on a mortgage payment. Once upon a time, it was quite common for Americans to have large families. But in our time raising children has become so expensive. In fact, it is being estimated that the cost of raising two children all the way through college will cost you $876,092… Raising two children from infancy through college remains one of the costliest undertakings. Using Economic Policy Institute data, Investopedia calculates $650,000 to cover childcare, transportation, meals, and other expenses, with college costs exceeding $230,000 for two children. “College is more expensive than ever, and many students take on a lot of debt, only to find that their paychecks don’t grow fast enough to pay it off quickly,” Battin said. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of college is $38,270 per student per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses. This is one of the reasons why our society values money so much at this stage. The truth is that it takes a giant pile of money each month just to live a normal life. Older Americans are far more likely to be living a middle class lifestyle right now because they control most of the wealth… As young buyers scrape together down payments, boomers are sitting on $82 trillion in wealth—more than twice what Gen X has and four times as much as millennials. New research shows the wealth gap has only widened since the 1980s, as older generations saw bigger gains in homeownership and stocks while younger people took on faster-growing mortgage debt. With boomers holding on to large homes and aging in place, younger buyers are struggling to break into a shrinking market. I know lots of Americans that are over the age of 50 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. But I know of very few Americans that are under the age of 40 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. Over the past several decades, homeownership among young adults has absolutely collapsed. I shared the following chart that was posted by Nathan Halberstadt on Twitter in a previous article, but I felt that I should share it again in order to illustrate this point… Just look at that chart. That is what a long-term economic collapse looks like. And I don’t think that anybody is even going to attempt to argue that I am wrong about that. The middle class is being systematically eviscerated. As older middle class Americans die off, they are not being replaced in sufficient numbers by young adults that are entering the middle class. In 2025, most of the population is just barely scraping by from month to month. Debt levels have risen to extremely alarming levels, and so have delinquency rates. This week, I was deeply saddened to learn that the delinquency rate on subprime auto loans has soared to the highest level ever recorded… The auto loan landscape is teetering on the edge of chaos as delinquency rates climb to unprecedented heights. Data from the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs reveal that subprime auto loan delinquencies have rocketed past 5%, a stark milestone that surpasses the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis. According to Experian, 30-day-plus delinquencies over the past year have risen 40% among consumers with the lowest credit scores, signaling growing distress among high-risk borrowers. Skyrocketing car prices, coupled with elevated interest rates and mounting economic pressures, are stretching household finances to the breaking point, leading to a surge in missed payments. Prime auto loan delinquencies, while reaching a 15-year high, but short of the crisis-era peak, suggest a more limited ripple effect among borrowers with better credit. It is starting to look a lot like 2008 all over again. And that includes mass layoffs. Large employers have been eliminating good paying jobs all over the nation, and in many cases these layoffs are being driven by the AI revolution… The list of companies laying off companies is growing following two years of significant job cuts in tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. According to Business Insider, a World Economic Forum survey found that some 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Big companies such as Oracle, CNN, Dropbox, and Block have all previously announced layoffs linked to AI. While Amazon has not reported any job cuts this year, CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June that the company will likely require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in the coming years as it increases its adoption of generative AI and AI agents. If things are this bad now, what will happen once AI can do almost all of our jobs less expensively and more efficiently than humans can? Of course AI is not the only reason why so many Americans are losing their jobs right now. As I discussed yesterday, this is the toughest job market that we have seen in ages. But don’t just take my word for it. According to the New York Fed, “confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low”… In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday. Respondents to the central bank’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The reading tumbled 5.8 percentage points from the prior month and is the lowest in the survey’s history dating back to June 2013. The economy is a mess. That is very clear. And it is also very clear that we are moving into an extremely challenging future. But that doesn’t mean that you should curl up into a fetal position and cry about it. You were born for such a time as this. It is when times are the darkest that the greatest lights are needed. Living the American Dream does not determine whether you are a “success” or not. You are living at one of the most important moments in all of human history, and you have been given a purpose that only you can fulfill. Yes, all of the crazy stuff that is happening all around us can be frightening at times, but don’t let all of that noise prevent you from becoming everything that you were created to be.

The city wants to place the Richmond Police Memorial Statue, which was defaced in 2020, in front of its police training academy. The cost to attend VCU has increased 59% in the past 20 years when accounting for inflation. Mountain Lake Lodge, the Southwest Virginia resort where parts of “Dirty Dancing” were filmed, has been inducted into the Historic Hotels of America. Virginia Commonwealth University will reduce the square footage and capacity of the $38 million track and field stadium project. The city plans to tear down the buildings and parking lots on the island and replace them with plants, walkways and picnic tables. Its new owner, Douglas Development, is planning 200 hotel rooms and 290 residential units for the 20-story tower.
