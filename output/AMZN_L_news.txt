Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is signaling he’s ready to take bold steps to revitalize the US chipmaker’s business and reclaim its competitive edge. “In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog,” he wrote in a letter to employees that was made public. The letter offers a glimpse of how Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, will lead Intel when it faces intense competition from Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, which use Taiwan’s TSMC to build cutting-edge chips. In naming Tan CEO, Intel’s board cited "his proven track record of creating shareholder value"—which can be a worrying sign for PC builders and technologists more concerned about the company’s chip prowess than its financials. But in his letter to employees, Tan said, "Under my leadership, Intel will be an engineering-focused company." "We will push ourselves to develop the best products, listen intently to our customers, and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we make so that we build trust,” he added. In terms of strategy, Tan says he’ll push Intel to “double down” on areas where the company already excels. In areas where it's behind, Tan will try to boldly leapfrog. "And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace." One of Tan's chief goals is to "establish ourselves as a world-class foundry," which indicates that he plans to keep Intel’s chip foundry business rather than spin it off. In 2021, the company made another bold bet by expanding into the foundry business under previous CEO Pat Gelsinger, who sought to compete directly with TSMC in contract semiconductor manufacturing. However, the endeavor is costing Intel tens of billions of dollars. An Ohio factory has also been delayed to the early 2030s. Meanwhile, TSMC is preparing to spend $165 billion to build six new fabs in Arizona. For now, Intel appears to be bullish on its upcoming 18A manufacturing process, which will start producing cutting-edge PC chips in the second half of this year. Both Intel and clients—including Microsoft, Amazon, and Arm—have signed up to use the 18A process. Although Tan’s letter is meant to rally the troops, industry watchers also expect layoffs. Before becoming CEO, Tan was an Intel board member for two years. But in August, he abruptly resigned over disagreements with Gelsinger. This included Tan demanding deeper cuts to Intel’s “bloated workforce” and bureaucracy, according to Reuters. Gelsinger initiated layoffs, but only to 15% of the company’s employee base.

Title: Can the Free Press Be Saved?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to protect independent media. When Disney announced yet another round of layoffs at ABC News last week, it came on the heels of a year in which almost 15,000 media jobs were lost—and capped off a quarter-century in which we’ve seen thousands of independent publications shut down or merged with larger conglomerates. The upshot is that Americans now find ourselves trapped in an information environment more tightly controlled than ever by a handful of oligarchs. The media has trended in this direction for decades, but the story lost all subtlety when Jeff Bezos issued the X post heard round the world. He declared that The Washington Post will focus its opinion section on “personal liberties and free markets.” That surely means more editorial attention on stifling monopolies like Amazon, right? Laura Jedeed Joan Walsh Walter Mosley Elie Mystal Mainstream media outlets have long faced dwindling audiences and, as a result, relied more and more on corporate benefactors. Now that those benefactors are competing to prove loyalty to their own benefactor in the White House, these essential institutions are stuck carrying water for the billionaire class, or else disappearing altogether. The task of rebuilding truly independent news outlets, then, falls to journalists, readers, and any concerned citizens who recognize how imperiled our free press has become—if there is to be any hope of the fourth estate holding the line against the second Trump regime. Editorial encroachment by corporate interests dates back to the inception of the media age, when the competing newspaper empires of the ultra-wealthy William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in a sensationalist race to the bottom, publishing incendiary headlines, exaggerations, gossip, and rumors that (among other ramifications) helped provoke the Spanish-American war. Yellow journalism, as it was called, abated thanks to the regulatory efforts of independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which established the fairness doctrine requiring equal coverage of conflicting viewpoints on consequential issues (like Trump’s ongoing attempt to take over the FCC). But Ronald Reagan, in his laissez-faire frenzy, repealed that rule. Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton signed the deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996, which critics have deemed “essentially bought and paid for by corporate media lobbies.” That same year, The Nation published a special issue on what we called the National Entertainment State. It detailed the growing media-industrial complex, where the corporations programming our news were increasingly programming public opinion. We represented this syndicate via a glossy centerfold diagram of an octopus with four tentacles, one for each of America’s dominant media conglomerates: Disney, General Electric, Time Warner, and Westinghouse (now CBS). Today, six tentacles control over 90 perent of our information. Things are different now, and not for the better. While the news has represented a small cog in larger corporate structures long before this second Trump administration, we are now witnessing mass public capitulation from corporate owners in a way that feels unprecedented. Whether today’s billionaire media owners are angling for large federal contracts or anticipatorily bending the knee so their companies are not seen as “the enemy,” the chilling effect is the same: Major media publications are even more incentivized now to treat the rich and powerful with kid gloves, if not outright sycophancy. The few that refuse to do this will have to face the wrath of our notoriously censorious, litigious head of state. The most powerful man in the world is currently suing Iowa pollster Ann Selzer for merely predicting that Kamala Harris would win the state last November; what he calls “election fraud” most people call “polling.” With that context, is there any reason to expect that prominent players like Paramount and Skydance would do anything but hold the line if it means getting FCC approval for their merger? The natural counterbalance to for-profit media would seem to be nonprofit newsrooms. They need not go cross-eyed from trying to keep in view both the public’s interest and that of their owner. In the US alone, there are at least 475 independent outlets, from the Marshall Project to the Center for Public Integrity, which has won several Pulitzer prizes for its investigative reporting. And independent journalism is currently enjoying a renaissance on self-publishing platforms like Substack and the newly launched Noosphere. These sites offer refuge for writers that have renounced (or been renounced by) corporate news, including Mehdi Hasan and Matt Taibbi. The journalistic equivalent of farm-to-table, it cuts out any meddlesome middle-moguls between the writer and the reader. (The Nation has been independent since 1865.) Yet neither of these alternatives offer a true one-to-one replacement for mainstream outlets. For all their latent bias, our media behemoths are uniquely positioned to furnish the resources to fund years-long investigations that often incur legal backlash, such as the Pentagon Papers—which might not have resonated as deeply with the Mailchimp logo at the bottom. Not so long ago, Jeff Bezos was proud to bear this torch. At the inception of his ownership, he claimed Katharine Graham’s pugnacious leadership as his model, and seemingly sincerely so, even if the Post did go soft on its coverage of Amazon of its own volition. I experienced Bezos’s benign neglect firsthand. From 2011 to 2022, I penned over 500 columns for the paper, most of them during Bezos’s tenure—including columns directly criticizing Amazon’s labor practices and even the corporate bias of the Post itself. I never received any note remotely resembling the kind of editorial restrictions that he is imposing today—the likes of which just led the columnist and associate editor Ruth Marcus to resign after four decades at the paper. Nevertheless, for a time, at least in this case, corporate ownership didn’t have to be mutually exclusive with editorial independence. But until that détente between owner and editorial is reestablished, audiences and reporters will continue to flee compromised publications. In his e-mail to The Washington Post’s team, Bezos argued that this newspaper of record could dodge offering a variety of perspectives because “the internet does that job.” It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to ensure that this is true. Donald Trump’s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started. In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches. Only robust independent journalism can cut through the noise and offer clear-eyed reporting and analysis based on principle and conscience. That’s what The Nation has done for 160 years and that’s what we’re doing now. Our independent journalism doesn’t allow injustice to go unnoticed or unchallenged—nor will we abandon hope for a better world. Our writers, editors, and fact-checkers are working relentlessly to keep you informed and empowered when so much of the media fails to do so out of credulity, fear, or fealty. The Nation has seen unprecedented times before. We draw strength and guidance from our history of principled progressive journalism in times of crisis, and we are committed to continuing this legacy today. We’re aiming to raise $25,000 during our Spring Fundraising Campaign to ensure that we have the resources to expose the oligarchs and profiteers attempting to loot our republic.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs are here and disrupting the markets, with new duties on aluminum and steel and threats against European spirits. He’s created a trade war with Canada, which just got a new prime minister, and slammed stocks. Despite that, Trump officials — and the president himself — have said tariffs are key to the U.S.’ economic strategy, and more duties are waiting in the wings. That could cause issues for companies like Boeing, which has warned of potential supply issues if Trump’s tariffs stick around for a while. Tesla is taking hits tied to CEO Elon Musk’s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which has helped federal agencies enact mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures (and given Mark Cuban an idea). Amazon is also appealing to Trump, as founder Jeff Bezos courts the president. Catch up on all that and more — including three senators’ demands for Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — in this week’s politics roundup. 2 / 12 President Donald Trump’s latest bid to tackle the European Union’s “hostile and abusive” trading practices is to tack new duties on alcohol imports.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The watch and accessories company is the latest to shore up its wholesale channel and pull back on direct-to-consumer sales. Fossil is the latest brand to pull back on DTC in a quest for profitability. Last year the company closed a net 54 stores globally, ending 2024 with 248, including 114 in the Americas. Remaining locations will get upgrades, emphasize traditional watches and highlight personalization, CEO Franco Fogliato, who arrived in September, told analysts Wednesday. “Looking at our direct-to-consumer business, we believe there is a significant opportunity to strengthen our model, becoming smaller but much more profitable,” he said. “We are deploying a two-pronged approach which includes prioritizing the wholesale channel and transforming our direct-to-consumer business model.” To shore up its wholesale channel and “bolster our relationships with our wholesale partners around the globe,” the company is working “to become increasingly less promotional in our DTC channels,” and helped drive gross margin expansion in Q4, he also said. Greben has “a strong track record of business transformations – ranging from deep turnarounds to high-growth strategies for a number of leading consumer brands,” the company said in a Wednesday press release. At Casper, he led the 2023 sale of the Canadian business and cut costs. He has also served as chief financial officer at various other companies, including Blue Apron, Ann Inc. and Quidsi, the Marc Lore-founded enterprise acquired and later shuttered by Amazon. In addition to its own branded merchandise, including Fossil, Michele, Relic, Skagen and Zodiac, Fossil has licensing agreements with Armani Exchange, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Skechers and Tory Burch. Fogliato said the company is making “progress toward achieving minimum royalty reduction with some of our long-time licensed brand partners who we continue to prioritize.” The company in February extended its agreement with Michael Kors, a partnership of some 20 years.

Title: FAIR: ‘These Strikes Are a Good Example of Why We Shouldn’t Just Succumb to Despair’CounterSpin interview with Eric Blanc on worker-to-worker organizing

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Janine Jackson interviewed Rutgers University’s Eric Blanc about worker-to-worker organizing as a key force of resistance for the March 7, 2025, episode of CounterSpin. This is a lightly edited transcript. The New Republic (2/13/25) Janine Jackson: The difficult and disturbing political moment is throwing some underlying fissures in US society into relief. Along with which side some folks turn out to be on, we’re learning what levers of power regular people actually have and how we can use them. And we’re reminded that the antidote to fear and confusion is one another, is community, including the particularly powerful form of community that is a labor union. Indeed, workers can wield power even shy of a union, though that’s not a story you will often read about in major media. Eric Blanc is a longtime labor activist and organizer as well as assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. He’s author of Red State Revolt: The Teacher Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics from Verso and, out this year, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big from UC Press. He also writes the newsletter laborpolitics.com. He joins us now by phone from here in town. Welcome to CounterSpin, Eric Blanc. Eric Blanc: Thanks for having me on. JJ: Well, let me ask you to start with federal workers, who are, as we see, a primary target of Trump and Musk, but you remind us federal workers are also a key force of resistance here. Tell us about that. EB: It’s hard to exaggerate the stakes of the fight right now around federal workers. There’s a reason that Musk and Trump have started by trying to decimate federal services and decimate federal unions, and that’s because they understand that these are blockages on their attempt to have sort of full authoritarian control over the government and to be able to just impose their reactionary agenda irrespective of the law. And they know that they need to not just fire the heads of these agencies, but they need to be able to have a workforce that is so terrified of the administration that they’ll comply even when the law is being broken. And so they have to go out after these unions and break them. And in turn, the stakes for, really, all progressive, all working people, anybody who has a stake in democracy, are very high because this is the first major battle of the new administration. And if they’re able to mass fire federal workers despite their legal protections to have job protections, despite the reality that millions of Americans depend on these services—Social Security, Medicaid, just basic environmental health and safety protections—if they’re able to destroy these services upon which so many people depend, this is going to set a basis for them to then go even harder on the rest of society. So think about immigrants and trans people and all of that. So the implications of this battle are very high. It is the case, fortunately, that federal workers are starting to resist, but there’s going to need to be a lot more to be able to push back. JJ: Well, I grew up outside of DC. Both my parents worked at federal agencies. All of my summer jobs were at federal agencies, and anyone with direct experience knows that, with 0.0 illusions about perfection—but we understand that there are widespread misunderstandings and myths about government, generally, and about federal workers, specifically. Trump says, “We’re bloated, we’re sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job.” How do we push back against that narrative? USA Facts (12/19/24) EB: Yeah, I think the basic response is straightforward, which is to highlight just how important these services are and to note that, far from having a massively expanded bureaucracy, the federal services, like most public services, have actually been starved over the last 50 years. The percentage of the workforce that works for the federal government has continued to decline for the last four decades. And so it’s just not the case that there’s this massively expanding bureaucracy. And if anything, many of the inefficiencies and the problems in the sector are due to a lack of resources and then the lack of ability to really make these the robust programs that they can and should be, and oftentimes in the past were. So it’s just not the case that either there’s a massively expanded bureaucracy or that these services are somehow not important. The reality is that the American people, in some ways, don’t see all of these services. They take them for granted. They’re somewhat invisible. So the fact that, up until recently, planes weren’t crashing, well, that’s because you have federal regulators and have well-trained federal air traffic controllers. And so when you start to destroy these services, then all of a sudden it becomes more visible. What will happen if you stop regulating companies on pollution, for instance? Well, companies can go back and do what they did a hundred years ago, which is to systematically dump toxins into the soil, into water, and all of these other things that we almost take for granted now that are unacceptable. Well, if there’s no checks and balances on corporations, who’s going to prevent them from doing all of this? And so I do think that there’s just a lot of basic education that needs to be put out there to counter these lies, essentially, of the Trump administration. For instance, the vast majority of federal workers don’t live in DC. This idea that this is all sort of rich bureaucrats in DC—over 80% of federal workers live all across the country, outside of DC. And just monetarily, it’s not the case these are people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, they’re making decent working class wages. Overwhelmingly, you can look at the data. So we need to, I think, be really clear both of the importance of these services, but then also just to say it’s a complete myth that the reason that ordinary working class people are suffering is due to federal workers. It’s a tiny part of the federal budget, first of all, the payroll of federal workers. And if you just compare the amount of money that goes to federal workers to, say, the wealth of Elon Musk, there’s no comparison. Elon Musk, richest man on earth, has over $400 billion net worth. That’s almost double what federal workers, 2.3 million federal workers as a whole, make every year. So you just see the actual inequality is not coming from federal workers, it’s coming from the richest in our country and the world. JJ: Well, an arm we have, a lever we have, is worker organizing to push back against this, besides us at home being angry and throwing our shoes at the TV. We can work together and we have historical models, we have contemporary models and examples of how that can work and how that can play out. I want to ask you to talk about the 2018 teacher strikes, because I see that you have lifted that up as a kind of analog, that there are lessons to be learned about places like West Virginia and Oklahoma, red states that in 2018 had this strike by teachers that, against all odds, one would say, were popular, connected with community, and were, in their measure, successful. I wonder what you think some of the tactical lessons were learned there. What did we learn from those strikes? Jacobin (3/9/18) EB: That’s a good question, and I think it’s important to start by just noting that these strikes are a good example of why we shouldn’t just succumb to despair now. There’s an overall sense of doom and gloom that nothing can be done because Trump’s in power, but I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think it’s accurate that nothing can be done. And the example of the red state strikes are a prime indicator that even when you have very conservative people in power, in government, workers have an ability to use their workplace leverage and their community leverage to win. And so in 2018, hundreds of thousands of teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and beyond went on strike. Even though those strikes were illegal, even though these were states in which the unions are very weak, right-to-work states, and even though the electorates in all of these states had voted for Donald Trump, nevertheless they got overwhelming support from the population because they had very simple, resonant demands, like more funding for schools, decent pay for teachers, make sure that there’s enough money so that students can get a decent education. These things cut across partisan lines in a way that, similarly, I think that the defense of basic services like Social Security and Medicaid today really does cut across party lines. And the tactics, then, that they used were, well, first they had to get over the fear factor, because these were illegal strikes, so they had to find ways to start generating momentum amongst teachers. They did things like really basic escalating actions like asking people to wear red on one day. So they didn’t start by saying, “Let’s go on strike.” They said, “Can you do this one simple action together? Can we all wear the same color on a given day?” And then they asked the community to come in. They said, “Community members, can you meet us after school on this day? We’re going to talk about our issues together. We’re going to hold up some signs. We’re going to provide some information.” So they built with escalating action towards eventually a mass strike. And they used a lot of social media because they couldn’t rely on the unions as much. Social media was very important for connecting workers across these states, for generating momentum. And eventually they were able to have extremely successful walkouts that, despite being illegal, nobody got retaliated against. They won, they forced the government to back down and to meet their demands. And so I do think that that is more or less the game plan for how we’re going to win around Musk and Trump. You have to essentially create enough of a backlash of working people, but then in conjunction with the community, that the politicians are forced to back down. JJ: Well in worker-to-worker organizing, it seems like what you’re talking about here, I think a lot of us who have worked with organized labor or have that memory think of it as a top-down enterprise. And so worker-to-worker organizing is not just like a bright spot, something to look at, but a way forward, something that can be replicated. You direct something called the Worker to Worker Collaborative. Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about what worker-to-worker organizing is or how it’s different from a model that some folks may hold in their head? We Are the Union (UC Press, 2025) EB: Yeah. The basic problem with more traditional, staff-intensive unionism is that it’s just too expensive. It’s too costly, both in terms of money and time, to win big, to organize millions of workers. And whether it’s on offensive battles like unionizing Starbucks or Amazon, or whether it’s defensive battles right now, like defending federal workers, if you’re going to organize enough workers to fight back, there’s just not enough staff to be able to do that. And so part of the problem with the traditional method is that you just can’t win widely enough. You can’t win big enough. Worker-to-worker organizing is essentially the form of organizing in which the types of roles that staff normally do are taken on by workers themselves. So strategizing, training and coaching other workers, initiating campaigns—these are things that then become the task and responsibility of workers themselves with coaching and with support, and oftentimes in conjunction with bigger unions. But workers just take on a higher degree of responsibility, and that has been shown to work. The biggest successes we’ve had in the labor movement in recent years, from the teacher strikes, which we talked about, to Starbucks, which has organized now over 560 stores, forced one of the biggest companies in the world to the bargaining table. We’ve seen that it works. And it’s just a question now of the rest of the labor movement really investing in this type of bottom-up organizing. And frankly, there is no alternative. The idea that so many in the labor leadership have, that we’re just going to elect Democrats and then they’ll turn it around—well, Democrats are sort of missing in action, and who knows when they’re going to come back into power. And so it’s really incumbent on the labor movement to stop looking from above and start looking, really, to its own rank and say, “Okay, if we’re going to save ourselves, that’s the only possible way. No one’s going to come save us from above.” JJ: And it seems that it develops also with just a more organic, if I could say, understanding of what the issues are because it’s workers themselves formulating that message rather than leadership saying, “We think this is what will sell, or we think this is what we can get across.” It seems more likely to actually reflect workers’ real concerns. In These Times, 11/22/24 EB: Yeah, that’s right. I mean, workers are best placed to understand each other’s issues. They’re also the best placed to convince other workers to get on board. One of the things bosses always say whenever there’s a union drive or union fight is, “Oh, the union is this outside third party.” And sometimes there’s a little bit of truth to that. I don’t want to exaggerate the point, but there could be an aspect of the labor movement that can feel a little bit divorced from the direct ownership and experiences of workers. But when workers themselves are organizing, oftentimes in conjunction with unions, but if they really are the people in the lead, then it becomes much harder for the bosses to third-party the union because it’s clear the union is the workers. JJ: Right, right. Well, how much does it matter, for this kind of bottom-up organizing, whatever it is that’s happening at the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board]? What role—I don’t even actually know what’s happening, it’s in flux as is everything. But you think that maybe not that we shouldn’t worry about it, not that we shouldn’t think about it, but we shouldn’t over-worry about machinations at the NLRB, yeah? EB: Well, I do think that the Biden NLRB was very good and it helped workers unionize. So the fact that we don’t have that NLRB anymore is a blow to the labor movement. I think we just have to acknowledge that. That being said, it’s still possible to unionize. You don’t need the NLRB to unionize. The labor movement grew and fought for many years before labor law was passed. And even today it’s very ambiguous. The NLRB is sort of paralyzed on a national level, but on a local level you can still run elections. And so it’s not even completely defunct. And I think it’s probably still possible to use it to a certain extent. But the reality is that the legal terrain is harder than it was. On the other hand, the urgency is even higher, and you still see workers fighting back and organizing in record numbers. I’ve been really heartened by, despite the fact that the legal regime is harder, you’ve had some major union victories just in the last few weeks under Trump. For instance, in Philadelphia, Whole Foods workers unionized despite Trump, despite an intense union busting campaign coming straight on down from Jeff Bezos. This was only the second time Amazon—because Amazon’s the owner of Whole Foods now—has lost a union election, and that was just a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. And so it shows that there is this real anger from below. And I think that there’s something, actually, about the Trump administration, that because it’s so fused to some of the richest people on earth with the administration in an oligarchic manner, but then unionization itself becomes almost a direct way to challenge the Trump regime. Because you’re going up against both their destruction of labor rights, and then also, frankly, it’s just the same people are up top. The bosses and the administration are almost indistinguishable at this point. JJ: And I feel like entities like Amazon, like Whole Foods, have presented themselves as sort of the future of business, the future of the way we do things. And so I think labor actions, first of all, recognizing that it’s still workers doing this and it’s not happening in a lab somewhere, they just seem like especially important places to call attention to in terms of labor activity. Eric Blanc: “I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity.” EB: Yeah. And I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity, right? And the labor movement is the number one force that can do that, and force the politicians to show which side they’re on. Are you on the side of Jeff Bezos or are you on the side of low wage workers who are fighting back? Waging more and more of those battles, even if it’s harder because of the legal regime, I think is going to be one of the most crucial ways we have to undermine the support of MAGA amongst working people of all backgrounds. JJ: Well, and we need one another for that support as we go forward. Well, finally, unless you’re living in a hole or unless you actually like what’s happening, it’s very clear that business as usual isn’t going to do, kind of wherever you’re walking in life, we need to be doing something bigger, bolder. But we know that there are people, to put it crudely, who are more afraid of disruption than they are of suffering. Disruption sounds very scary, doing things the way they haven’t been done yesterday, even though we do have history that we can point to, is scary. And I think that makes the stories we tell one another and the stories we tell ourselves so important, the coherence of the vision of the future that we’re able to put out there is so crucial. And of course, that brings me back to media. You mentioned the importance of social media, independent media, just the stories that we tell, the stories that we lift up, the people that we lift up. It seems so important to this fight. It’s not meta phenomena. So I just wonder, finally, what you see as a role for different kinds of media going forward? Federal Unionists Network EB: Okay. I think it’s absolutely crucial. One of the reasons why the right has made the inroads it has is that it’s been better at getting its story out there and waging the battles of ideas through the media, through social media, and through more mainstream media. And frankly, our side has trailed. Maybe it’s because we don’t have the same resources, but I think it’s also there’s an underestimation of how important it is to explain what is going on in the world, to name who the real enemies are, and to provide an explanation for people’s real anger and their real anxiety about what’s happening. So yeah, I think it’s absolutely crucial. And I think we need to, as a labor movement, as progressives, as left, really push back and provide an alternative explanation that all of these problems are rooted in the power of billionaires. It’s not rooted because of the immigrants, not because of the federal workers, not because of trans kids. And I’ll just say that one of the things I find to be hopeful is that social media is being used pretty effectively now by this new federal workers movement, and I’ll give you one plug, which is that they have a new website, go.savepublicservices.com, through which anybody can sign up to get involved in the local actions happening nearby. It’s going to be a rapid response network to stop all of the layoffs that happen locally, wherever you live, and to save the services on which we depend. So people can go to that website, go.savepublicservices.com, and take advantage of that media opportunity to get involved locally. JJ: Alright then, we’ll end on that note.

Title: Twitch's CEO on its biggest competition, Big Tech's growth-at-all-costs mindset, and why Twitter isn't really a town square

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology You have probably heard of Twitch, the company that basically invented livestreaming in the US, and that Amazon bought for $1 billion in 2014. Do you use Twitch? That's a different question. There are now lots of places to watch people do things live on the internet. And some streamers who really broke through on Twitch — like Kai Cenat, or Hasan Piker — spend a lot of time on rival platforms, too. No problem, says Dan Clancy. The Twitch CEO, who's been on the job for two years, says he thinks his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences — and, crucially, for audiences to connect with each other — that doesn't exist elsewhere. I had other questions for Clancy, like: When will Twitch actually make money for Amazon? And what happened to plans to port Twitch-like experiences to other places — like NBA games? And in a world where moderation is a political hot button, how does Twitch deal with streamers who talk for hours on end and are often likely to say something that will upset someone? We talked about all that in a recent chat, recorded live at South by Southwest in Austin. You can hear the whole thing on my "Channels" podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. Hasan Piker, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, was recently suspended after making an extended metaphor about the healthcare system that involved killing US Sen. Rick Scott. He's been suspended multiple times. How do you get suspended at Twitch? Do you get involved when it's a high-profile person? Is this automated? How do you get reinstated? So first of all, the suspensions are not indefinite. They're there for a given period of time. Sort of a timeout. Right … to try to make sure people stay within the guardrails. If someone goes outside the guardrails a little, give them a little bit of timeout. So then [streamers know]: "OK. I'm going to work hard to stay within the community guidelines." We have a team that does that. It's not automated. I'll be aware of their decisions for certain high-profile [streamers]. But it's not my decision because the whole point is to keep some degree of separation. Even before last fall's election, we were seeing tech platforms rethinking moderation and rules, and they were moving away from moderation in some cases. Elon Musk led the way on that with Twitter. Now it seems like there's additional political pressure for platforms and media companies. How is that affecting Twitch? We were lucky in that we were not overly aggressive previously. I think sometimes, especially with misinformation and other things, people moved the line. And we had always consistently said, "Listen, you should be free to say what you want. It's how you say it. You can't be spewing hate. You can't be threatening violence … " But you could say, "I want to take ivermectin to deal with my COVID." Correct. We did have a policy [to deal with] someone whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation, but that doesn't really happen on Twitch. We don't have the viral spreading of information. More often than not, what people say on Twitch is a manifestation of what they hear through the other platforms. So someone might say, "Oh, I read a Facebook post the other day that said this." So you've always been sort of looser than some of the other platforms. And it doesn't seem like the Jim Jordans of the world are going after you and subpoenaing you and asking you to explain why you censored so-and-so. Is that because it's just a different platform? Is it because they don't know what Twitch is? No, I think it's because we have not been getting into that space. In general, we have not waded into censoring people. People talk about Twitter as a town square. Twitter's not really a town square because it just spreads all over the place. In a town square, you're either in the town square or you're not. And on a Twitch channel, either you're watching the channel live or you're not. If someone doesn't want to watch the channel, don't watch it. It doesn't algorithmically suddenly appear in their feed. You show up; you watch a channel. If you don't want someone watching your channel, you can ban them and stop them from watching your channel. In the pandemic, a lot of people discovered Twitch, and people spent a lot more time on Twitch. Then there was a rush from YouTube, Microsoft, Facebook to build their own version of Twitch. They offered huge contracts to some of the biggest Twitch streamers. Now they basically have all sort of retreated from that business. Their hope was, "I'll lose money on this creator. But all these users will come." But when that creator left Twitch, there was another creator ready to step up and become the next big thing on Twitch. They filled that void. And so [rival platforms] said, "No, this doesn't work. We're not really pulling [audience] from Twitch. So why do we want to keep losing money on these deals?" So you had deep-pocketed competitors that walked away. Does that mean they concluded they could never compete? Or did they decide this business is not worth it for them and they can get a better return doing something else? It's absolutely the case that the VOD business, like TikTok and YouTube, is a great business. You watch that when you have five minutes here, five minutes there, and you add up the five minutes … it's a great business. I mean, it's bigger than our business. Their thought was, "This will be on top of our business." And they still all do live. It's not like they pulled back from live. They've pulled back from signing money-losing deals. And when you pull back from that artificial injection of capital, Twitch, because it focuses on live, [streamers say]: "No, I'd rather be on Twitch." A while back Twitch was on the radar of media companies, and people like the NBA were saying they wanted their broadcasts to look more like Twitch. They had demos where there was a basketball game going on with all Twitch stuff on the side. It doesn't look like that ever took off. Is that media companies saying, "Actually, we're not really ready for a Twitch-like experience"? Is that the audience saying, "We're not ready for that"? I think it's people misunderstanding what is so special about Twitch. Let's take music. There's a ton of musicians on Twitch. And people said, "I know — we'll put music on Twitch. We're going to film a concert." So you take one concert and you film it. But then the creator isn't interacting with the community online. It's not distinctly different than what you can watch in a VOD, right? And it happens once. So the people are not building community among themselves. The musicians that use Twitch — they often use Twitch more to engage with their audience and community and doing whatever they do in their free time. The poster child example is T-Pain, who's a big musician who streams on Twitch all the time. I'll chat with him and hang out with him on Twitch, and he games on Twitch. He does his sound recording on Twitch. The point is, it's not about taking traditional music media and sticking chat next to it. That doesn't create community. That is just traditional premium media with people chatting alongside, which they already do on Twitter. Two years ago, you became the Twitch CEO. Then you had layoffs. Then you said Twitch wasn't profitable, which is why you made the cuts. It's kind of shocking to hear that between Amazon's resources and Twitch's cultural cachet that Twitch wasn't making money. Is it making money now? So I don't talk about where we're at now. But when you say it's shocking — it's not that shocking. Uber didn't make money until last year. Yes, but they were in a different business. And YouTube was making money — not right away, but … I was at YouTube from 2010 to 2012. For a long time, YouTube was not profitable. So I don't think it's that strange. I think this is an issue in the tech space, where there is this mindset of, "Build your organization for where you're going to be in three or four years." That came out of Google, in part because Google was lucky enough to have a money machine in the back of the house. So everyone else — it was like grow, grow, grow. Get a big team. Get a big team. And to be honest, part of what happened to Twitch, they kind of fell into that at Amazon. The Twitch team, when they first got there, they were very scrappy. And then people would come and say, "No, no, no, that's not the game here. You have to argue for more resources." And having been in Big Tech, that is the game: How do you argue for more resources? As opposed to: How do you figure out what is the number you need to serve your audience in your community? And so we were just like many other folks in tech. We were just not running the business as well as we could have. Jump to

Title: Ryan Breslow Settles Lawsuits After Returning As Bolt CEO: ‘I Made A Ton Of Mistakes’

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin , Forbes Staff. Bolt's Ryan Breslow is back as the CEO of the payment startup he cofounded after a string of legal disputes with investors were settled. Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Mark Cuban wants to 'out-Elon' Elon Musk and plug a hole created by DOGE

“Shark Tank” star and entrepreneur Mark Cuban knows a thing or two about getting a new business up and running. His next venture may be hiring the workers laid off by Tesla (TSLA+3.19%) CEO Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Cuban has been reviewing pitches for a new business from former and current employees at the General Services Administration (GSA) and the White House, he told Politico. His eventual goal is to back some of those potential companies and help their workers leverage the skills they developed while working at the federal government as a contractor. “I think it’s possible to out-Elon, Elon, because the people he will bring in don’t know what they don’t know,” Cuban told Politico. The new venture would take former employees of the U.S. Digital Service, who served as an in-house consultant for federal agencies on information technology. The group was rebranded as DOGE by President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing Musk’s group. In February, 21 staffers said they would resign instead of helping DOGE slash federal spending, including through mass layoffs. Those employees, all of whom previously had senior jobs at tech giants like Amazon (AMZN+1.95%) or Alphabet’s (GOOGL+1.35%) Google, warned that the people Musk hired were political ideologues who lacked the necessary skills to carry out Musk’s vision, The Associated Press reported. Cuban would also enlist former workers at the 18F unit housed within GSA, which was charged with modernizing and building critical tech services for the government, including public-facing services like Login.gov and guides for federal and state agencies. The unit was dissolved on March 1. “A couple have a real chance to turn into small companies that can leverage their expertise,” Cuban told Politico, referring to some of the workers. Cuban envisions his tech company as profitable, although it’s unclear how that would be achieved. Federal agencies determine how much can be outsourced to the private sector and at what cost, and the Trump administration hasn’t shown an interest in remaking either 18F or USDS, according to Politico. 18F has also had a rocky history with finances. The unit fell millions of dollars short of its own revenue projections over its first three fiscal years and took home no revenue during its first year of operation, according to a 2016 report from the inspector general of the GSA. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now leading Technology Transformation Services, told staff that 18F “was not and has not been fully cost coverable,” according to FedScoop. In fiscal year 2024, the program was $18 million short and lost $5 million in fiscal 2025. “Despite the losses the team was incurring, 18F with their recent hourly prices were on the very high end of the technology consulting market,” Shedd said. Cuban told Politico that the new company would have to generate private sector revenue in addition to federal dollars. It would also likely have to rely on state and local deals until a friendlier federal government is in place, a former 18F staffer told Politico.

Title: FTC seeks delay in Amazon Prime lawsuit, blames Musk's federal layoffs
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107127-ftc-seeks-delay-amazon-prime-lawsuit-blames-musk.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:16:00Z
Full Content:
In a nutshell: The FTC wants a judge to delay the agency's trial against Amazon over allegations it used deceptive marketing practices for its Prime subscription program. The reason for the request is that Elon Musk and the Trump administration's layoffs of federal workers has left the FTC short on employees and funds. The FTC said in its 2023 complaint against Amazon that the company knowingly tricks people into signing up for Prime through the use of "Dark Patterns," a reference to the number of options at the checkout suggesting people sign up for automatically renewing Prime subscriptions. It also alleged that canceling the subscription is a task involving multiple unnecessary steps, which could cause some people to give up before the end. A trial was due to begin in September, but FTC lawyer Jonathan Cohen has asked US District Judge John Chun to postpone it by two months. "Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment," Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday, via Associated Press. "We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team." Cohen confirmed to the judge that the FTC's resource challenges stemmed from the recent cuts made to federal government employees. Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has laid off over 62,500 federal workers since its inception. Cohen said some FTC employees had chosen to leave in January after DOGE's "Fork in the Road" email, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed employees to announce their resignation effective September 30, 2025. In return, participants would retain full pay and benefits until that date. Adding to the staffing problems has been the government hiring freeze, which Cohen said has prevented the FTC from replacing staff members who resigned for other reasons. Cohen said the FTC doesn't want to push the trial date back by more than a couple of months, but he still couldn't guarantee it would be enough time for the agency to address its issues. He couldn't even guarantee that things won't be worse by November. The FTC's legal team is "racing at considerable cost" to meet a late April deadline for discovery, Cohen said. It is also dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel. Amazon doesn't want the delay. One of its attorneys said most of the FTC's legal team assigned to the case were still employed by the agency, and that the FTC lacks grounds for a delay. Amazon denies it engaged in deceptive practices related to its Prime subscription service. If the FTC wins the suit, Amazon could potentially refund affected Prime customers.

Title: FTC: Staffing Cuts Could Delay Amazon Trial

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says staffing cuts could delay its case against Amazon. As CNBC reported Wednesday (March 12), attorneys for the regulator have asked a judge to hold off on the start of a trial into whether Amazon had tricked customers into signing up for the company’s Prime program. The reason? Staging and budget shortfalls, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, told Judge John Chun during a status hearing in federal court in Seattle ahead of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin Sept. 22. “We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on our case team,” Cohen said, asking the judge for a two-month continuance. As the CNBC report noted, the agency’s request is happening as the White House’s new Department of Government Efficiency is pushing to reduce spending, an effort that has included layoffs of tens of thousands of federal employees. The judge asked Cohen how the FTC’s situation “will be different in two months” if the regulator is “in crisis now, as far as resources.” Cohen replied by saying that he “cannot guarantee if things won’t be even worse.” He even said it’s possible that the FTC may have to move to another office “unexpectedly,” which could hinder its ability to prepare for the trial. “But there’s a lot of reason to believe … we may have been through the brunt of it, at least for a little while,” Cohen said. As PYMNTS reported last month, the FTC has of late made moves that suggest that the business world’s hopes that the Trump administration would take a more relaxed approach to regulation may be unfounded. For example, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said last month the agency would continue to use the merger guidelines established by the commission and Department of Justice in 2023. The same day, Ferguson named David Shaw as the FTC’s principal deputy director, describing him as “an experienced antitrust lawyer with expertise in high-stakes litigation and contentious merger review.” The FTC sued Amazon in June of 2023, alleging that the tech giant had employed practices that “tricked and trapped” customers into signing up for Prime recurring subscriptions. The suit argued that Amazon has used “dark patterns” to dupe consumers into enrolling into the program, while also making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. The regulator also alleged that while Amazon had revamped its cancellation process for at least some subscribers, “the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.” Amazon has said the FTC’s case has no merit, and — per the CNBC report — also opposed the agency’s request to delay the trial.

Title: Resident Evil and Witcher 3 mocap director says video game industry layoffs have made it so "nothing is guaranteed," but AI won’t be replacing real actors "anytime soon"

As the SAG-AFTRA strike continues, union negotiators warn that the latest proposal from the industry is "still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SAG-AFTRA video game actor strike continues, and one of the key points of the dispute remains protection against AI. Today, the union has sent out a message denouncing the potential of "AI abuse" in the latest contract negotiations, but in a recent interview at least one prominent figure in the performance capture world is confident that AI can't truly replace human performances "anytime soon." "There's no doubt that the industry is going through a challenging time," Steve Kniebihly, a performance capture director who worked on the likes of Heavy Rain, The Witcher 3's DLC packs, and Resident Evil Village, tells Entertainment Weekly. "Layoffs, budget cuts, and uncertainty have made it clear that nothing is guaranteed – even for successful studios. To me, what makes this job interesting in the first place is that weird, intangible chemistry between an actor and a director. It's the trust at the core of that relationship that pushes everyone to give the best of themselves and creates more than the sum of its parts. And I'm not going to get that from A.I. anytime soon." While Kniebihly is confident AI can't replace the quality performance you get from a real actor, the gaming industry seems keen to protect its ability to build AI simulacrums of human performers. SAG-AFTRA's negotiations with the game industry have been ongoing since the strike began in 2024, and the union is unhappy with what ground big publishers are willing to give here. "Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse," SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told members in a message also shared with Eurogamer. "The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers." For their part, negotiators representing the game industry say they've offered "industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor's performance in other games." Some SAG-AFTRA actors work with at least some non-union contracts, but many have elected to suspend that work until the strike against the wider industry is resolved. Such is the case with the voice of Zenless Zone Zero's Soldier 11, Emeri Chase, who was recently replaced in the role, saying "I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you." As game actors strike for AI protections, Amazon Games boss says we need more AI and it's not "taking work away" because "for games, we don't really have acting."

Title: Roomba-Maker Warns Investors It Could Die, Stock Craters
URL: https://gizmodo.com/roomba-maker-warns-investors-it-could-die-stock-craters-2000574985

Your Roomba could soon be a worthless brick. iRobot’s stock fell as much as 40% early Wednesday after the maker of robot vacuums told investors that it has “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue.” Sales were down 44% in the last three months of 2024 at $172 million versus $307 million the year prior, though the company hopes a slew of new Roombas introduced this week will help stem the decline. Even there, iRobot could be impacted by President Trump’s trade war. Roomba is synonymous with robot vacuums, having first introduced the product back in 2002. But today, the market is saturated with comparable products from companies like Roborock, Shark, and Xiaomi, which make similar robot vacuums at prices often undercutting iRobot. The company was slow to release a combination mop and vacuum robot, and customers often complain that the Roomba’s vSLAM mapping and detection technology is not as good as laser-based alternatives. Newer models do have some nice features, like an option to program them to sweep only specific areas of the home, like the kitchen. Of course, however, Roombas still cannot ascend stairs. Robot vacuums are more of a want, not a need—and, frankly, vacuuming yourself can be therapeutic. 23 years after its introduction, the Roomba still gets stuck, or runs over poop and smears it across the floor. The dream of combining robotics with useful AI in the household has always been just off in the distance, almost perfect but not quite. According to CNN, iRobot has launched a “strategic review of alternatives for the business” that could ultimately result to a sale or refinancing of its debts. Perhaps Amazon can step up and try to acquire the company again after its previous attempt was scuttled by European regulators over concerns that Amazon would prioritize iRobot in its marketplace. President Trump has shown himself willing to go to bat for leaders of industry that have supported him, yesterday running an advertising campaign for Tesla at the White House. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who quickly fell in line with the president, could call in a favor. Amazon probably does not want iRobot anymore, however. The robotics company’s stock is down 90% from its highs only a few years ago, and the acquisition offer was made in 2022 before the downturn that led to mass layoffs and austerity measures. Amazon has invested heavily in robotics in warehouses to drive down costs, however, where there could be some synergies in shared mapping technology. And it is renewing its push in the home by upgrading Alexa with generative AI. The hope has always been that owners of Echo speakers would use them for everything, including ordering home goods from Amazon. That never panned out, but maybe the new Alexa will turn things around. There is some angle where it could make sense to try and acquire iRobot again as part of some broader strategy. iRobotRoborockRobots Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Amazon is merging its convenience and grocery store corporate teams

Let C-Store Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Combining the teams comes as Amazon Go has struggled to grow while Amazon Fresh has sharply increased its store count recently. The latest changes at Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh reflect broader shifts happening across the company. In a public letter sent to Amazon’s employees last September, CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company would be cutting some middle managers as a means to improve efficiency. Jassy reiterated this message a few weeks ago during an interview with Bloomberg. That initiative seems to have made its way to Amazon’s retail teams. According to two people familiar with the matter, Amazon’s vice president of retail, Claire Peters, hosted a video call in late February informing impacted employees that their roles would be eliminated. Amazon confirmed on Tuesday that impacted employees in the U.S. will receive their pay and benefits for at least the next 60 days, as well as job search support and access to transitional health benefits. They’ll also be eligible for severance. These changes come after a bumpy few years for Amazon’s physical retail arm. Amazon Go has shuttered over half of its locations across the U.S. over the past few years as a cost cutting measure, dropping from as many as 30 stores in early 2023 to about 15 today. And although Amazon Fresh eclipsed the 60-store mark last year, the grocery chain had to pause the rollout of all new stores in 2023 due to economic difficulties. Amazon’s spokesperson emphasized that despite these setbacks, the company will continue to invest in its grocery and c-store business. The merging of these corporate teams also comes about six weeks after Amazon appointed Whole Foods Market CEO Jason Buechel head of its Worldwide Grocery Stores division, which includes Amazon Go, Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. Amazon’s spokesperson said on Tuesday that the latest structural changes are unrelated to Buechel’s promotion. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Jason Buechel’s surname.

Look, I get it—learning new skills while juggling life, work and maybe a rogue houseplant that just won’t stay alive can feel like a lot. But in 2025, upskilling isn’t just a “nice-to-have”—it could be key to professional survival. Between AI reshaping jobs, the cost of living making your bank account cry and companies demanding more and more (but somehow still paying the same), staying stagnant isn’t an option. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or fresh in the game, investing in yourself is some of the best career insurance you can get. Here’s why upskilling isn’t just smart—it’s a power move. Companies are scrambling for skilled workers, yet somehow, too many talented people are getting ghosted by hiring managers. Why? In my opinion, it's because they’re looking for specific skills that many professionals were never given a chance to learn. In fact, 2021 McKinsey data showed that 87% of companies knew they had a skills gap problem or would in the next few years. Upskilling—whether it’s diving into AI, sharpening leadership skills or mastering digital marketing—is how you make yourself invaluable. When you show employers you’re adaptable and always learning, you’re no longer just another résumé in the pile. Let’s be blunt: Inflation is affecting many of us, and “exposure” doesn’t pay rent. Upskilling gives you leverage. Learning high-demand skills can increase your earning potential by thousands—one Amazon study found for average workers surveyed, upskilling could "result in a raise of $8,000 per year." So whether you’re gunning for a raise or looking to switch to a better-paying job, the right skills can be your ticket there. The job market in 2024 was a roller coaster—and not the fun kind. With Canada experiencing its highest unemployment rate since 2017 (outside of the pandemic), landing a job is tougher than ever for many. Employers are likely to be looking for candidates who bring something extra to the table. Upskilling helps you do just that. When you take the initiative to level up your skills, it signals to hiring managers that you’re proactive, adaptable and ready to add value from day one. It’s the difference between blending in and standing out. Mass layoffs seemed to become the norm in 2024, and spoiler: Companies will likely continue to “restructure” in 2025. The best way to protect yourself is to become the person they can’t afford to lose. AI is shaking up industries, and knowing how to work with it (instead of being replaced by it) is crucial. Employers aren’t just looking for warm bodies—they typically want problem-solvers who can think critically and leverage new tools effectively. Upskilling in areas like AI, automation and leadership helps make you the person they want to keep when budget cuts hit. Upskilling isn’t just about landing a new job—it’s also about making your current job easier. Take AI, for example. Learning how to use it properly can automate the tasks that suck up your time, making you more efficient without working longer hours. More skills equals more confidence, more control over your work and fewer late-night panic sessions over a project that could have been automated. Upskilling isn’t a “maybe someday” thing—it’s a valuable investment in your career, your earning potential and your peace of mind. The old rules of success (work hard, wait for a promotion and hope for the best) are broken. The new rules? Learn, adapt and take control of your career. So how do you actually get started? First, get clear on what you want—like a raise, a career pivot or just to feel less like an imposter at work. Then work backward. Check job postings for roles you want. What skills keep showing up? Find a course that teaches practical skills (not just theory) and has real success stories. And don’t underestimate the power of community. The right network can unlock opportunities faster than a perfect résumé. Pick one high-impact skill, commit to learning it and go all in. Your future self (and your paycheck) will thank you.

Title: How Musk, Trump, and Your Boss Learned to Hate Democracy

Mother Jones illustration; Evan Vucci/AP, Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/AP You sit in a cubicle. You stand behind a cash register. You press your knees into the ground, straining to fix a burst pipe. It is a Thursday at 11 a.m., and you are at work. Are you free? Professor Elizabeth Anderson in her book Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (And Why We Don’t Talk About It) says, in a way, no. You are not in a democracy in your workplace; you’re under a private government run by a dictator: your boss. The rules are set. And you—especially if you’re not in a union—have almost no say. As the New Yorker noted, Anderson’s idea hits on a “striking American contradiction.” Private Government shows how, “on the one hand, we are a freedom-obsessed society, wary of government intrusion into our private lives; on the other, we allow ourselves to be tyrannized by our bosses, who enjoy broad powers of micromanagement and coercion.” Since Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, two CEOs, took the reins of the United States government, I have been thinking a lot about Anderson’s theory of bosses as dictators. Musk and Trump have framed a series of blatantly anti-democratic and disruptive executive branch actions as the efficient maneuverings of “high-IQ” businessmen. The president has signed a series of executive orders that are likely illegal, as he stretches the law in the name of his “mandate.” Musk and his legion of engineers have been dismantling the government under the righteous banner of fighting “fraud.” If the violent January 6 riot was a seditionist insurrection, how should one describe the 2025 version of a MAGA takeover? The moves by DOGE, Musk, and Trump—running roughshod over norms and republican democracy—seem more familiar to me than armed revolt. It’s downsizing; it’s layoffs; it’s control by one annoying guy who for some reason is richer than you and is convinced that “working the weekend is a superpower.” It’s government run like a business. (Specifically a start-up.) The president not as democratic leader within a system of checks and balances, but as an imperious CEO with the power to do what’s needed. It’s dictator as boss, and boss as dictator. I think when you consider that businesses are run by dictators—that a firm is not a democracy—it makes sense why a series of rich guys at the top of the capitalist world think government can be run without following any laws. I called up Anderson to discuss all this. We talked about DOGE, Musk, capitalism, and much else. This interview was edited for length and clarity. How do you think understanding your boss as a dictator helps us make sense of what’s happening right now in the Trump administration? Once we grasp that the default constitution of the capitalist workplace is a dictatorship—that the business class feels that it’s infinitely superior to government workers; that they think they could clean things up and make things way more efficient by running government as a “business”—we realize what they’re essentially saying is: We gotta run government like a dictatorship, a place where the boss rules. That’s the picture. And so, they think these bosses can ignore all the regulations and constraints on the internal operation of the agencies; they can fire people at will without cause; they can just go through smashing and disrupting stuff—and, somehow, innovation will come out of it. It’s this Ayn Rand-ian element of glorifying the megalomaniacal CEO. Musk can say: Let me do my thing, because I am the brilliant, disruptive innovator who’s going to transform everything. But I can only do that if I can fire people en masse and destroy all industries—so that I can emerge as the hero. Rand’s idea of freedom was that the smart people, like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, were screwed by rules and restrictions on the talented. And so we need to free people like him and other brilliant CEOs to do whatever they want. The key is not empathy but empowering the right people. And whatever happens to other people, so be it. Exactly, because Rand thinks those other people don’t matter—deep down. That’s why under capitalism now there’s a selection effect. It is the megalomaniacs—the narcissists—who rise to the top, given the incentive structure of the system. But, you know, these narcissists…they’re very thin-skinned. In their inner psychic lives they feel wounded every time somebody doesn’t worship them. Which sounds a lot like anyone’s annoying boss—powerful and thin-skinned. It also helps me understand why so many on the right are obsessed with IQ. It can’t be that bosses got lucky. It has to be that they are naturally destined to rule. Musk is a classic example of this. He has had genuine entrepreneurial success. I’ll grant him that. But he thinks that it’s because he has general intelligence. IQ is actually only measuring like a tiny part of intelligence. Musk is a total idiot when it comes to public policy. He believes any kind of crap that some idiot posts on X. He has no sense of reality outside of his business. He just goes smashing through, thinking that he’s a great innovator; in fact, he’s wrecking everything. The capitalist firm, as it is set up right now, rewards that kind of person. Right, and it rewards the kind of people who think that the rest of us are nobodies and it doesn’t matter what happens to us. Right now, there’s the abstract boss behavior: I am the ruler, god of government, I don’t have to follow the rules for executive orders. And also the literal ways in which they’re acting like a boss: Elon Musk telling employees to send me an email of five things you did this week or you will be fired. How do you connect those two things? The history of all right-wing parties is their base is business owners—small, medium, and large. And the capitalist firm is a dictatorship, that’s its constitution. The boss, whatever he says, goes. Most American workers who are not unionized have false ideas about their entitlement to a job. Most American workers are not aware that the default status of employment is at will. You can be fired at any time, for any reason (except for like a handful of anti-discrimination rules). That power changes how bosses think. They don’t think they have to follow rules. They can do what they want to you. Then you look wider. What are the objectives of so many policies over the last 50 years of neoliberalism? It’s plutocracy: To make capitalists rule, not just within the firm. That’s happening now. They get to be the bosses of everything. That makes me think of the radicalization of the supposedly “normal” Silicon Valley types. I listened to a podcast with Marc Andreessen. He’s among many rich tech people who talked about being radicalized to vote for Trump. And he didn’t say it started with President Joe Biden’s attack on tech or Black Lives Matter protests. He said: I was radicalized around 2012 by all the annoying “kids” working for me. His experience as a boss is a big part of what moved him further right. That’s exactly right. The problem that the tech bros got into is that in order to attract talented engineers for their start-ups they had to give them a lot of power within the firm. You attract a lot of talent if the workers feel like they’re empowered and they’re being listened to and treated with respect. But then that turned in the 2010s. At some point, the tech bros become billionaires. Then, they feel miffed. The money goes to their heads! They feel like they’re Superman. Why aren’t people respecting them? And this is where respect means following orders, keeping your silence—it’s not your place to talk back to them, because look at how much richer they are than you. And they started getting pissed off. That merges with the ideology of the tech world, where there is a cult of the founder. And it can turn into dictatorial ideology. Now, we have nutcases like Curtis Yarvin whispering about the benefits of monarchism. Now it’s not just rulers of their company. They think they ought to be rulers of the world. The philosophy changes as it appeals to what they need. Monarchism becomes appealing when you’ve been a monarch in a company. Another point here is that often the tech bros have been cast as libertarian-right. They just want freedom. But, no, what they want is freedom for themselves. They want impunity for themselves to do whatever they like. That is to be free of government regulation, but also to be free of criticism. They always billed themselves as libertarians, but in reality there’s always been a symbiotic relationship between libertarianism and authoritarianism within the capitalist firm. And once you’re a billionaire, you have a much bigger footprint than just your firm. You can affect whole states just by threatening to leave, like Amazon. When you talk about Amazon like that, it reminds me of what you mentioned earlier, when you talked about the goal of neoliberalism. That term can be confusing. But really—and I think I am getting this right from Quinn Slobodian’s book—it’s that many people in the 20th century and during decolonization wanted money and capital to float freely above the constraints of a specific country. This gave businesspeople supreme power, and it gave companies power to act like nation-states themselves. You’re totally right about that. It was in the 70s, somebody wrote a book called The Sovereign State of ITT. ITT was this big, sprawling, global company of its day. And basically it said: Look, this is not, you know, just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill corporation. It really is acting like a sovereign state. That’s what we have today in spades, with these much bigger, more powerful companies than ITT ever was. What do you think being in charge of one of those companies, like Musk and Trump have been, makes you think of democracy? Well, what good is it? I mean, that’s what they think. That was there for a long time in Silicon Valley culture: disruption. What was disruption? I’m going to walk in there and start breaking a lot of laws and establish my business model. And that’s essentially how Uber got launched—ignore, just completely disregard, laws. The thing is, many people want this. They want to see government “run the government like a business.” Like a dictatorship, is what they’re saying. There is a grain of truth in some of this: private for-profit corporations make decisions much quicker than the bureaucracies of democratic states do. Absolutely, that’s true. And so what happens is, when you have an encounter between what are these very successful corporate types and a civil servant, they just look at the civil servant and they think: These guys are idiots; I can run circles around them. To a certain extent, it’s due to the fact that there’s been a systematic repression and defunding for a lot decades of government, too. I was actually thinking more about the obsession with Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore. Which is to say that so often it seems totally fine to many people not to have a democracy as long as the streets are clean. It’s popular. But also, we also have to factor in the fact that people don’t know what the government does for the middle class—it’s enormous, but it’s hidden. It’s buried in the tax code, like the mortgage interest deduction, the fact that you don’t pay income taxes on employer-covered health care, these enormous tax advantages, the tax deferral of your pension plan. It’s there for the better-off middle class. That’s the neoliberalism part: It was about both freeing markets and the government working through markets—so we hid the government’s work. I mean, what’s interesting about DOGE is it will take a while for the American people to realize that this random, nihilistic destruction—just for the gleeful destruction of it all—actually comes back to bite. Because people are unaware of how much they depend on government services. Still, now you’re starting to see people show up at town halls yelling. Veterans can’t book an appointment at a Veterans Affairs hospital. They serve their country, and now they’re getting screwed over. They’re getting pissed, not to mention that almost a third of civil servants are veterans. Another example: you can look at it both from the employment perspective and the consumer perspective. The National Park Service has been gutted, so now people who would spend their vacation camping out at Yellowstone, maybe they can’t get a reservation because the systems have broken down.

Title: Billionaires At Trump's Swearing-In Have Since Lost Over $200 Billion

As Donald Trump took the oath of office on Jan. 20, he was flanked by some of the world's wealthiest people. The billionaires present that day - including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - had never been richer, flush with big gains from frothy stock markets. Seven weeks later, it's a different story. The start of Trump's second term has delivered a stunning reversal for many of those billionaires sitting behind Trump in the Capitol Rotunda, with five having lost a combined $209 billion in wealth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The period between Trump's election and his inauguration was a boon for the world's wealthiest, with the S&P 500 Index hitting several all-time highs. Investors piled into equity and crypto markets, expecting that Trump's policies would be advantageous to business. Musk's Tesla Inc. gained 98% in the weeks after the election, hitting a record high. Arnault's LVMH added 7% in the week before Inauguration Day, making the French magnate $12 billion richer. Even Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc., which banned Trump from the social-media platform in 2021, gained 9% before the beginning of the new term and an additional 20% in his first four weeks in office. But any expectations that the start of Trump's new term would continue to fuel market returns have been upended. The S&P 500 has lost 6.4% since he took office, as mass layoffs of government employees and the president's back-and-forth on tariffs have roiled equities, with the benchmark index tumbling 2.7% on Monday. The companies behind the inauguration attendees' fortunes have been some of the biggest losers, dropping a combined $1.39 trillion in market value since Jan. 17, the last trading day before the inauguration. Here's a look at some of those fortunes: Elon Musk (down $148 billion) The 53-year-old Tesla chief executive officer's net worth peaked at $486 billion on Dec. 17, the largest fortune ever recorded on Bloomberg's wealth index. Most of his gains came from Tesla, whose stock nearly doubled after the election. Since then, the electric carmaker has given up all of those gains. Consumers in Europe have soured on Musk's support for far-right politicians, with Tesla sales in Germany falling by more than 70% in the first two months of the year. Chinese shipments also fell by 49% last month to levels not seen since July 2022. Jeff Bezos (down $29 billion) Bezos, 61, who clashed with Trump over the postal service and his ownership of the Washington Post during the president's first term, congratulated Trump the day after the election on Musk's X social-media platform. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund in December, and Bezos dined with the president last month, the same day that Bezos announced that his newspaper will prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its opinion section. Amazon shares have fallen 14% since Jan. 17. Sergey Brin (down $22 billion) Brin, 51, who co-founded the company then known as Google with Larry Page and still retains a 6% stake, joined a protest against the Trump administration's immigration policy at the San Francisco airport in 2017. After Trump was re-elected in November, Brin dined with him at Mar-a-Lago the following month. Alphabet Inc.'s shares tumbled more than 7% in early February after it missed quarterly revenue estimates. Representatives from Alphabet, which is currently facing pressure from the Justice Department to break up its search engine company, last week met with the government and asked it to take a less aggressive stance. Mark Zuckerberg (down $5 billion) Meta was the standout winner among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks at the beginning of this year. Even as the group of companies that has powered much of the S&P 500's gains over the past few years were flatlining, Meta rose 19% from mid-January to mid-February. Since then, though, the stock has lost all those gains. The Magnificent Seven index is down 20% since its mid-December high. Bernard Arnault (down $5 billion) Arnault, 76, whose family owns the luxury conglomerate behind brands including Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, has been a friend of Trump's for decades, speaking with the then-candidate the day after the Pennsylvania assassination attempt in July. After declining through most of 2024, LVMH jumped more than 20% from the election through late January. It's since given up most of those gains. Morningstar analysts said last month that a 10% to 20% tariff on European luxury goods could depress sales, which have already been struggling.
