Read By Tl;dr – Oracle remains the x-axis of AI/cloud computing Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Beyond bombastically scripted earnings calls, deploying CAPEX effectively and efficiently at scale takes place in a cold, hard reality. We’ve been chronicling Oracle’s difficulties building data centers at bonsai scale, never mind at hyperscale: Oracle (company slogan: “that’s not just a rack, it’s an entire region!”) has slowly increased its CAPEX spend, but at a pace that falls further and further behind the hyperCAPEX companies. Oracle’s first decent-sized data center, the oft-touted yet somehow still under construction project in Abilene, is well on its way to becoming the picture accompanying the dictionary definition of “construction site”. Partly it earns that status because it has taken so long, but also because that data center has so many mouths to feed (Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure, Lancium, Crusoe, Oracle, and Open AI are all laying claim to those construction photos). Oracle’s primary contribution seems to consist of yelling at the contractors. Oracle is “all-in” on their data center plans, and has expended enormous energy to get themselves referred to as a “hyperscaler”. But are they really in the hyperscaler club? Let’s see how Oracle stacks up with actual hyperscalers. This is a high-stakes financial game requiring gargantuan resources and a broad array of competencies. When it comes to the metrics, Oracle always seems to play the role of the x-axis (a joke I never tire of and Oracle never manages to break away from that gravitational pull). Let’s look at some proxies for financial prowess: Oracle is the revenue runt of their aspirational litter. By a lot. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is the runt, except for Meta who don’t have a cloud business. (One of the great mysteries of the universe is where Meta sees the return coming from its rapidly escalating infrastructure investment promises — $600 billion and counting!. Unlike our other contestants, they have no cloud services business and a checkered history serving developers. As with Elon, taking a dependency on Meta is high risk. Maybe Meta alone has glimpsed some new zero-to-one geyser of revenue that will pay for all those data centers? Regardless, and reluctantly returning to today’s topic at hand, Meta still has vastly more cash to play this game than Oracle). Three-for-three on runt status. Oracle does show leadership on one metric: the debt to equity ratio. They’re already carrying a much bigger debt load than their desired peer group, while also the company that could most use some credit. For free cash flow (cash flow minus CAPEX), Oracle is yet still again the runt. Oracle’s competitors are both spending much more on CAPEX and still have significant, positive free cash flow. And when we look at the most recent quarter, Oracle’s free cash flow went negative (-$394 million) as they ramped their CAPEX spend to (merely) $9 billion in the quarter. Now let’s look at CAPEX spending, that ultimate separator of clouds and clowns. Emphatically runty. Oracle is already more stressed with their (modest) CAPEX spend relative to revenue. Cumulative CAPEX spending gives us a sense of how much infrastructure a company has deployed. Amazon, AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft all spent more on CAPEX in the last year than Oracle has in the last decade, and all but Meta spent more last year on CAPEX than Oracle has in its entire fifty year existence. All of which is to say Oracle is both way behind in deployed infrastructure and playing with the smallest stack of chips in this game. Which brings me (at long last!) to my point: Oracle has hyped big revenue growth forecasts for the next couple years. In particular, they tout a deal with Open AI to bring in as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue by FY28 (we’ll ignore the question of why Microsoft decided it didn’t want this business and discarded it to Oracle). If you’re excited about the revenue opportunity in front of Oracle, you also have to grapple with the costs of the infrastructure necessary to deliver that revenue. No infrastructure, no revenue. No CAPEX, no infrastructure. So where does the money for data center CAPEX come from and what are the implications for Oracle’s free cash flow, debt load and/or margins? They need to step up from their current (modest) levels of spending which are already stressing the company’s financials. It is pretty clear Oracle is not very efficient in its CAPEX spend. They’ve been publicly demonstrating they are early on the learning curve, struggling to forecast CAPEX spending a quarter out, much less years out. They’re also in a big hurry, and there is a YOLO infrastructure cost premium. Some hardware is scarce (GPUs, gas turbines). Costs and wait times for both interconnection and hardware delivery have widened, while the hyperCAPEX companies are both bigger buyers and got in the queues earlier. End-to-end, Oracle lacks a manufacturing machine that turns dollars into data centers efficiently and effectively at scale. Over the last three years, Oracle has spent between $1 and $2 of CAPEX per dollar of cloud infrastructure revenue. AWS CAPEX historically has been between 25 to 60% of revenue (and is ramping back up as they deploy AI infrastructure). We could also model CAPEX spend based on the incremental revenue it drives (new capacity allows new revenue), which makes that $30 billion revenue dream even more expensive (and remember those GPUs are short-lived, especially if you’re chasing the pre-training market). It looks like Oracle is going to lean more on OPM (Other People’s Money or perhaps Oracle Pleads for Money) for its CAPEX spending. The data center build team was hit in the recent Oracle layoffs. The Abilene data center is already a layer cake of financial participants. Stargate was briefly the OPM salvation, but it has “struggled to get out of the gate”. Open AI finds itself doing party rounds for both cash and electricity, raising billions of dollars instead of trillions, and scavenging for megawatts rather than gigawatts. Maybe those notoriously charitable financial actors will accept lower returns just to partner with notoriously charitable Oracle? Going the OPM route negatively impacts Oracle margins, architectural control, and time-to-market. How do Oracle’s hyperscaler hopes and dreams get bankrolled?

Title: MicroCo Wants to Be the Alpha Werewolf Billionaire That Vertical Dramas Need

Laugh at vertical dramas’ alpha werewolf pregnant billionaire storytelling all you want, but don’t let the giggling distract you. Vertical dramas are massive. For young filmmakers they offer a low-barrier entry point. For entrepreneurial producers, they’re a chance to become mini-mini moguls. In 2024 alone, over 36,000 new series launched. Already a $7 billion business in China, the market is projected to top $10 billion globally (outside China) by 2027. Last month, Cineverse — the folks who brought you “Terrifier” — and Lloyd Braun’s Banyan Ventures announced MicroCo, a new microseries studio and platform.

The ambition isn’t to be another ReelShort or DramaBox. It wants to be the Amazon Prime of vertical drama, producing originals and curating the best from thousands of existing titles. I spoke with Cineverse president and Chief Strategy Officer Erick Opeka about MicroCo’s ambitions and why he sees vertical dramas as the next inflection point. Full disclosure: I’m excited to see what happens with vertical dramas and I’m a little bit conflicted about that. This is filmmaking at its most disposable. For this format that’s a feature, not a bug. It’s storytelling that leans into the dopamine with cliffhangers every two minutes; logic and nuance are roadkill. China can’t create a $7 billion business without America taking notice, but we might be slower to respond if we weren’t living through a moment otherwise defined by layoffs, consolidation, and other forms of retreat (Neuehouse, RIP). Growth feels good. Like it or not, this is a ground floor — but not for long. My interview with Erick has been edited for brevity and clarity. In Development: When did vertical video first cross your desk? Erick Opeka: A couple of years ago. In another incarnation we were owned by a Chinese company, so we’ve always been keeping an eye on trends. It was starting to pop up around the same time TikTok started to take hold. I saw it start to be something we were interested in maybe about 18 months ago. What do you see as the potential for this? If you look at the evolution in China, it’s not just targeted toward women looking for romance. About 550 million people in China viewed vertical microdramas as of the summer of this year. It’s gotten so big that it’s stealing mindshare from the more legacy streaming services. It’s resonating with their daily use patterns and cadence and mobile-first society. The pattern we’re already seeing in the US — the very soapy stuff taking hold, becoming a billion-dollar business in the US, and the top apps beating out Netflix and Hulu and Disney in the app store in revenue generated — tells me over the next five years, you’re going to see that happen here. What’s compelling is there’s no ecosystem around this in the US today, even though it’s already a billion-dollar business. I hear anecdotal things, but there’s no PR channels, no IMDB for this stuff. And these things are like mayflies, right? They premiere, they get mined of their value in two to three weeks, and then they’re into the ether and it’s on to the next one. It kind of hearkens back to the early days of cinema and the nickelodeon, and there was no star system yet. You had the Biograph Girl. It parallels a lot of what you would see in the early development of a new medium. Our goal is to build out the Roku or Amazon Prime of the space for the US. The other opportunity is there’s a lot that are clearly not professionally produced storytelling. It’s not so much the production value, but how do you maximize the storytelling? Putting together a team like Susan, Lloyd, and Jana, they understand big, brash storytelling. We’re not coming in with any kind of hubris that we’re going to reinvent the format. The format works. It’s about going back to the basics and doing a better job with western-style storytelling for US audiences. How would you distribute this? You have to have your own app to be a credible player. We’re a tech company. I have the engineering team and staff. We operate hundreds of apps in the ecosystem, so this is not something that is unfamiliar to us. The other piece is what I’ve seen as TikTok evolved into a multi-platform media company. They have connected TV apps, they have smart TV apps. It’s growing quite fast. I didn’t think vertical video on a big TV was going to work, and it’s kind of working to some degree. It’s just weird. Maybe people want to use their phone to text and goof around, and these stories are light engagement. The other thing is if we serve as the Hulu or Amazon or whatever analogy you want to make, there is no catalog value to most of these things. [We’d be] aggregating them, providing the fan layer, providing the information so people can find them. We’d also be working with major media companies, mobile providers, and others to provide our app or create a custom version of the content. We’d also produce, much like Prime, a nice layer of premium things. A lot of people see the team we’re putting together and think this is somehow going to be some ludicrous overspending. It’s quite the opposite. It’s like a puzzle we’re all trying to solve: How do you do what is already being done, without spending much more, and just do it better than it’s being done? There’s no need to put A-list talent in a $250,000-produced micro drama. This audience isn’t going to resonate with that, anyway. I think microdramas are going to serve a two-way approach. One is IP that will graduate into bigger phenomenon, and bigger IP will make the format stay top of mind — rather than going to the movies two or three times a year for most Americans. But it’s got to graduate from Harlequin romance-style stuff. Don’t get me wrong, we’re going to play that up. If you saw the names of some of the shows we’re contemplating — we’re like, how do we one-up everybody at this game of just getting ridiculous with it? We’re going to have fun with it. Are you looking to produce, or is this going to be acquisitions of independents? What’s the plan there? It’s going to be a mix. We’re starting to see some companies and producers that are getting really good at this. Most are kind of outside the system [or] recent film school grads from top programs that have been trying to break in. They’ve gotten good at scaling and figuring out how to do it. Very entrepreneurial. Some of the top producers in the space have very little to no Hollywood background. These are all indies. Right? I interviewed one of the vertical filmmakers, Yun Xie. She was fascinating. She made a feature that won Slamdance. Really? Yeah. And she was awesome. She’s a powerhouse. I was so impressed by her energy. So many directors come off as brash. That’s not her, but she’s very clearly focused. You hit the nail on the head, right? If you look back to the ‘90s indie film world vibe of just how excited people were and they were excited to get up every day and try to figure out how to get their movie and just crack the space. There was a palpable excitement around it. I feel that same kind of energy. I agree. People feel like, not only do I have a shot to get things made and do things and move forward with something that’s fun, compelling and new, but there’s real money to be made. I mean, you got to make a lot more of them to make money, but the money that’s being spent in this space is not immaterial anymore. What kinds of budgets are you looking at? The numbers have been all over the board and a lot of it reflects the indie film world. Cheaper it is, the more sweat equity and favors are being called — they’re doing these for below six figures. The price point is settling anywhere between $150,000 and $400,000. There’s people who are starting to become known and those cost a little more. And just because it’s a white-hot space, there’s not a ton of experienced producers. Demand is outstripping the supply, driving up prices a little bit right now. How many do you think you’ll produce or release in a year? We’re still working on that number. We’re going for a little higher quality as opposed to quantity. I don’t think we’re going to be at the cadence of the top players that drop one microdrama a day. But maybe one a week. Maybe two a week, toward the back half of our first year. How are you going to handle payment? There’s this whole system of coins and you lose track of what you’re actually spending. “It’s just one more coin.” You add it up all up at the end and holy crap, I just spent $40. Yeah. This business was spawned out of gaming companies who use a lot of these techniques to unlock levels. Every two minutes, beginning, middle, end, cliffhanger. It’s designed to hook you in. It drives high levels of engagement. Early adopters have a willingness to pay a lot more money. [But] look at what happened in streaming to expand and get the last corners of everybody. You’ve had to launch a lot of ad-supported, subsidized, lower-price things because most people can’t afford to pay 40 bucks to watch a soapy microdrama. Apps have already started to develop subscription levels, which are equally expensive. $20 a week or $200 a year, which is insane when you think about it. Over time, this business starts to look more like traditional media, but I think the coin piece will always kind of be hanging around. They’ll probably just get cheaper. In China there’s a lot of pressure for this to be far more ad supported. You’ll see the same dynamics here. If someone produced a vertical independently, what is the price point that you’d be looking at to buy it? If it’s great it’s going to get the market rates, which are in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. If it’s experimental or they’re a new producer, it might be less than that. But this is [only] one opportunity. Normally filmmakers complain a lot about the rev share model. That’s feast-or-famine, [but] even moderately successful microdramas can make a lot of money. There’s a real opportunity for rev share on these. It’s like making a Netflix movie. You make it, you sell it, you bake in your profit margin and on to the next one. But if people get really good at it, if they build their own franchises, if they have their own characters, You’re going to see exactly what’s evolved in traditional entertainment economics: They’re going to demand [rev share] and they’re going to get it. A detailed statistical analysis of one of the biggest questions looming over every young cinephile’s mind: Do I need to go to film school? Whatever you think of the term “NonDē” as a replacement for “independent” — I see the logic, but find it aesthetically hideous and overcomplicated — this is an insightful article about the evolving role of film festivals for filmmakers who accept that the game has changed. Another data-driven story that serves as a nuanced counterpoint to the adage that Hollywood is completely run by sequels. That’s still largely true, of course, but Thomson offers a deep dive into the level of performance required for a film to receive a larger investment for a sequel. It’s a pessimistic take on the larger state of the traditional film industry, but those seem to be the only honest ones. A nuts-and-bolts roundup of high quality advice for anyone wrestling with the question “how do I become a director?” Horton offers a healthy mix of old advice that has maintained its relevance in a changing world and newer tips that feel fresh today, but anyone looking to launch a filmmaking career could do a lot worse than using this as a primer. Writing for the Business of TV Substack, Topping offers another potential explanation for the surge in vertical drama popularity: the medium is becoming the only place to enjoy the kind of romantic melodrama that used to be readily available on bigger screens. It’s a thoughtful analysis of an age-old phenomenon: when the larger entertainment industry stops serving a popular product, somebody else will inevitably emerge to fill the void.

Title: The Cost Of Living The American Dream For A Lifetime Has Reached A Whopping 5 Million Dollars

Time Published: 2025-09-08T20:48:51Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world has happened to us? When I was growing up, it was assumed that pretty much everyone in my generation would be able to achieve the American Dream. But today most of the U.S. population is not living the American Dream, and more people are falling out of the middle class every day. As I have detailed in previous articles, this is particularly true for Millennials and those in Generation Z. The collective prosperity of the middle class has been declining for an extended period of time, and now that long-term decline threatens to become a full-blown avalanche. Borrowing money always creates pain, and since 2009 our leaders in Washington have borrowed and spent 27 trillion dollars that we did not have. Pumping all of that extra money into the system has had very serious consequences, because now the purchasing power of our dollars has been greatly diminished. In fact, Newsweek is reporting that the cost of living the American Dream for a lifetime has now reached 5 million dollars… The American Dream has long symbolized the promise of opportunity, prosperity, and upward mobility. Coined in 1931 by writer James Truslow Adams in The Epic of America, the term described “that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.” But nearly a century later, achieving that vision is more expensive than ever. According to new research published by Investopedia, the lifetime cost of attaining the traditional American Dream—including homeownership, retirement, raising children, a wedding, new cars, healthcare, pets, and annual vacations—now totals roughly $5 million. These calculations assume a college-educated, dual-income household capable of sustaining these ambitions over a lifetime. Is your household going to bring in 5 million dollars over the course of your lifetime? Sadly, most U.S. households don’t have a prayer of getting anywhere even close to that. But if you want to live the American Dream for an entire lifetime, that is what it is going to take. We live at a time when virtually everything is steadily becoming more expensive. In a previous article, I explained that each month an average family of four spends $996 on groceries, $1,437 on health insurance, $745 on a vehicle payment and $2,259 on a mortgage payment. Once upon a time, it was quite common for Americans to have large families. But in our time raising children has become so expensive. In fact, it is being estimated that the cost of raising two children all the way through college will cost you $876,092… Raising two children from infancy through college remains one of the costliest undertakings. Using Economic Policy Institute data, Investopedia calculates $650,000 to cover childcare, transportation, meals, and other expenses, with college costs exceeding $230,000 for two children. “College is more expensive than ever, and many students take on a lot of debt, only to find that their paychecks don’t grow fast enough to pay it off quickly,” Battin said. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average cost of college is $38,270 per student per year, including books, supplies, and daily living expenses. This is one of the reasons why our society values money so much at this stage. The truth is that it takes a giant pile of money each month just to live a normal life. Older Americans are far more likely to be living a middle class lifestyle right now because they control most of the wealth… As young buyers scrape together down payments, boomers are sitting on $82 trillion in wealth—more than twice what Gen X has and four times as much as millennials. New research shows the wealth gap has only widened since the 1980s, as older generations saw bigger gains in homeownership and stocks while younger people took on faster-growing mortgage debt. With boomers holding on to large homes and aging in place, younger buyers are struggling to break into a shrinking market. I know lots of Americans that are over the age of 50 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. But I know of very few Americans that are under the age of 40 that are successfully living middle class lifestyles in 2025. Over the past several decades, homeownership among young adults has absolutely collapsed. I shared the following chart that was posted by Nathan Halberstadt on Twitter in a previous article, but I felt that I should share it again in order to illustrate this point… Just look at that chart. That is what a long-term economic collapse looks like. And I don’t think that anybody is even going to attempt to argue that I am wrong about that. The middle class is being systematically eviscerated. As older middle class Americans die off, they are not being replaced in sufficient numbers by young adults that are entering the middle class. In 2025, most of the population is just barely scraping by from month to month. Debt levels have risen to extremely alarming levels, and so have delinquency rates. This week, I was deeply saddened to learn that the delinquency rate on subprime auto loans has soared to the highest level ever recorded… The auto loan landscape is teetering on the edge of chaos as delinquency rates climb to unprecedented heights. Data from the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs reveal that subprime auto loan delinquencies have rocketed past 5%, a stark milestone that surpasses the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis. According to Experian, 30-day-plus delinquencies over the past year have risen 40% among consumers with the lowest credit scores, signaling growing distress among high-risk borrowers. Skyrocketing car prices, coupled with elevated interest rates and mounting economic pressures, are stretching household finances to the breaking point, leading to a surge in missed payments. Prime auto loan delinquencies, while reaching a 15-year high, but short of the crisis-era peak, suggest a more limited ripple effect among borrowers with better credit. It is starting to look a lot like 2008 all over again. And that includes mass layoffs. Large employers have been eliminating good paying jobs all over the nation, and in many cases these layoffs are being driven by the AI revolution… The list of companies laying off companies is growing following two years of significant job cuts in tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. According to Business Insider, a World Economic Forum survey found that some 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Big companies such as Oracle, CNN, Dropbox, and Block have all previously announced layoffs linked to AI. While Amazon has not reported any job cuts this year, CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June that the company will likely require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” in the coming years as it increases its adoption of generative AI and AI agents. If things are this bad now, what will happen once AI can do almost all of our jobs less expensively and more efficiently than humans can? Of course AI is not the only reason why so many Americans are losing their jobs right now. As I discussed yesterday, this is the toughest job market that we have seen in ages. But don’t just take my word for it. According to the New York Fed, “confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low”… In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday. Respondents to the central bank’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The reading tumbled 5.8 percentage points from the prior month and is the lowest in the survey’s history dating back to June 2013. The economy is a mess. That is very clear. And it is also very clear that we are moving into an extremely challenging future. But that doesn’t mean that you should curl up into a fetal position and cry about it. You were born for such a time as this. It is when times are the darkest that the greatest lights are needed. Living the American Dream does not determine whether you are a “success” or not. You are living at one of the most important moments in all of human history, and you have been given a purpose that only you can fulfill. Yes, all of the crazy stuff that is happening all around us can be frightening at times, but don’t let all of that noise prevent you from becoming everything that you were created to be.

Title: Amazon has lots of software bugs with Kindle Updates

The latest Amazon Kindle software update, which includes all the new accessibility features, has been a resounding success. However, there are always a few bugs that need to be addressed. The 15.8.4 update causes the screen to flicker constantly, but this issue can be resolved with a reboot. Multiple popups appear, blank and without any text. Sideloaded books had invalid ASIN numbers, but this issue has been resolved with a new Calibre update issued on September 5th. The update also has errors with borrowing e-books from the Kindle Unlimited program. Many of the books that users want to download are not downloading properly. The only way to fix this issue is to factory reset the Kindle, which will obviously delete all your content, including sideloaded books. Obviously, users should not have to go to these great lengths to use their Kindle as they normally would. Software updates have been causing more problems for the past couple of years, causing more problems than they solve. This started in 2022 when Amazon switched its programming language from JavaScript to React Native. This happened right after the new home screen experience was rolled out. Instead of your library being on the home screen, it now features page after page of recommendations and Amazon trying to sell you more Kindle Books. Firmware updates have been steadily deteriorating after the programming change. Still, they reached a breaking point every year since Amazon conducted layoffs of Kindle executives, engineers, programmers, and the book recommendations team. Hundreds of people left during those years, and dozens more did so due to the increased workload, but their pay remained the same. A few people in the Kindle division told me last month that morale is at an all-time low and Amazon simply doesn’t really care about Fire Tablets, Kindles, and Fire TV boxes anymore.

Title: Perfect Competition Will Crush AI Profits
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/perfect-competition-will-crush-ai-profits/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T14:30:01Z
Full Content:
By Dan Amoss PostedSeptember 6, 2025 Today’s AI investment craze suffers from the same flawed assumptions that sparked past bubbles. Without a course correction, the U.S. economy faces a self-inflicted bust. In the mid-2000s, Wall Street’s best and brightest were packaging subprime loans into complex securities and assuring the world they were safe. Regulators nodded. Rating agencies blessed them. Investors snapped them up. Few asked the obvious question: What if the assumptions behind these instruments are wrong? Today, a similar blind spot is spreading through the economy – not through mortgages, but through artificial intelligence (AI). Everyone from Big Tech giants to startup founders, institutional investors, and Washington policymakers is convinced that artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, and that big capital expenditures (capex) today will lead to countless industrywide profits in the future. But there’s a problem: Demand in value-added, real-world applications is unlikely to be large enough to justify all this investment. The demand that AI promoters constantly highlight is drawn from Large language model (LLM) training sessions and queries – neither of which is associated with much sustainable, real-world revenue. Much of the revenue being booked in this ecosystem ultimately comes from a limited pool of venture capital (VC) funds. A recent story from The Information estimated that these LLM companies generate roughly $18.5 billion in annualized revenue. Ironically, The Information was trying to rebut the claims from an MIT Media Lab report that concluded 95% of businesses are seeing no return on AI pilot projects. It’s ironic because $18.5 billion in annualized revenue is peanuts relative to the astonishingly large amount of capital poured into these companies. The revenue streams in the chart above are also not very valuable because LLM companies are not showing positive operating leverage. Plenty of evidence indicates that costs scale alongside revenue at LLM companies. Heavy users burn lots of electricity and shorten Nvidia chips’ lives in their usage of the models. And free users will just switch to a competing LLM if ever required to pay a subscription fee. Today’s AI investment mania has two key blind spots: the fallacy of composition and adverse selection. Let’s break those down. The fallacy of composition is the mistaken belief that what’s true for one player is true for all. If one company like Microsoft makes money selling AI products, then investors assume the entire AI sector will do the same. But that’s not how competitive markets work. In fact, success in a competitive market often comes at the expense of rivals. There can be winners, but not everyone can win. This fallacy infected the telecom boom of the late 1990s. Just because one broadband provider had profitable demand didn’t mean every fiber-optic network was worth building. Billions were spent laying cables that no one would use for another decade. Then there’s adverse selection. In insurance, this happens when sick people are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people, leading to losses for the insurer that doesn’t attract enough healthy customers. In AI, something similar is unfolding: the heaviest users of AI chatbots and tools – those demanding the most computing resources – are often not paying enough in subscription fees to cover their costs to the LLM provider. The casual users, who make up the vast majority, may never convert to paying customers. This undermines the very business model these companies are betting on. What happens when the market discovers this? You get a doom loop: companies overspend on infrastructure, hoping for future demand that never materializes, while investors keep piling in – until someone finally notices the emperor is minimally clothed. There’s a popular narrative that the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) will capture most of the economic value created by AI. But history suggests otherwise. In past tech revolutions, the biggest winners weren’t always the biggest companies. The advent of the internet helped millions of small and mid-sized businesses gain customers and compete globally. Low-cost e-commerce tools like Shopify and advertising platforms like Google and Facebook gave them the reach they never had before. Similarly, it’s possible that AI’s biggest beneficiaries won’t be the firms building the models, but the dentists, restaurant owners, and local manufacturers who use those tools to accelerate mundane processes and serve customers better. The irony? While these SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) benefit, the AI platforms enabling them may struggle to get paid. If Google’s new Veo video model helps a dentist craft a great local ad, will that dentist pay Google more? One of the most dangerous assumptions in AI capex is that these platforms will enjoy pricing power – meaning they can charge enough to cover their costs and then some. But look closely, and this assumption crumbles. The AI chatbot market looks a lot like perfect competition, a textbook term for markets where many providers offer nearly identical products, and prices fall toward the cost of production. Unlike the broadband boom of the 2000s, where companies had to rip up streets to lay wires and customers had few broadband alternatives, switching from one AI model to another takes a few clicks. If you’re a free user of ChatGPT, and it suddenly costs $20 a month to use it at all, but Claude or Gemini is free and just as good, nothing is stopping you from switching. That’s the nightmare scenario for the AI providers: they’ve built massive infrastructure assuming recurring subscription revenue, but the customer base may have no loyalty and little willingness to pay. It’s like investing billions into oil wells only to find out your oil sells for $10 a barrel instead of $70. In a healthy economy, production and consumption communicate constantly. If a company builds something useful, customers respond by buying it. If they overbuild, inventories pile up and prices fall, sending a signal to slow down. AI infrastructure, by contrast, is being built largely on faith. Companies are scaling up compute power without clear signs of sustainable demand. Unlike oil and gas, where prices adjust second-by-second, AI companies operate in a fog. They release tools, collect usage stats, and hope that paid conversions will follow. But hope is not a business model. In fact, today’s AI leaders resemble 2006-era banks more than healthy, feedback-driven enterprises. They’re in an unhealthy relationship with venture capital (VC) firms that need higher and higher valuation “marks” to justify their fees. VC firms don’t want transparency about customer conversion rates, churn, or operating losses that scale with revenue. That would kill the narrative before the VCs can cash out in IPOs to the public market. Meanwhile, China is asking a much more grounded question: How can we use AI to make real-world industries more efficient? Companies like DeepSeek are building AI tools designed to solve narrow problems in energy, logistics, and manufacturing. That’s closer to how the human brain works – selectively activating regions based on the task at hand. And it’s proving to be more effective than trying to create superintelligence in a box. While U.S. Big Tech chases lofty visions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – often undefined and possibly unachievable – China is deploying AI in practical ways that produce results. To compete, the U.S. must start asking more rigorous questions: What is AI actually for? Who pays for it? And how does it improve the lives of average Americans? If there’s one place where AI hype is meeting hard reality, it’s software engineering. Veteran developer Carl Brown, in an interview with Ed Zitron, shredded the idea that large language models (LLMs) will replace human coders anytime soon. He explained how writing code is only a small part of the job. The real work is long-term thinking, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the software should do. AI tools can crank out lines of code fast. But they often do it sloppily, duplicating functions and ignoring best practices. The result is software that’s harder to maintain, easier to hack, and more prone to crashing. Brown compared AI code to “vibe coding,” which is typing something into a chatbot and hoping it works. That might be fine for a one-time prototype, but it’s a recipe for disaster in a software program that’s meant to last. Worse still, managers – who assume AI is miraculous because they hear about it so much on CNBC – don’t understand programming. These managers are using AI to justify layoffs or to demand unrealistic productivity increases from their teams. This may create a generation of junior engineers who never learn to code properly because they’re relying on tools that don’t understand the long game of software development. It’s often claimed that software is the most natural market for AI to disrupt. However, Carl Brown’s view, plus dozens of other examples, confirm that in real-world stress tests, AI misses too many things, or hallucinates too often, to be considered a revolutionary technology trend. So, in the months ahead, we’re likely to see more hints that Big Tech companies are tapping the brakes on Nvidia chip orders. They’ll do this to avoid an accelerating decline in their free cash flows – a trend that’s already looking scary. For example, see this projection from BofA Global Research. It shows capital spending as a percentage of operating cash flow at the companies building hyperscale data centers. A recession or a bust in venture capital funding for AI LLM companies (like OpenAI) could drive operating cash flow lower. That would make the BofA chart surge higher than they project in the dotted lines. And higher capex relative to cash flow means free cash flow would dive toward zero. To avoid that scenario, hyperscale data center operators would cut AI chip orders. Editor’s note: Members of Strategic Intelligence Pro can access Dan’s full report, including the stock pick, here.

Ireland and Hungary go head-to-head in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier in Dublin on Saturday evening. Both sides will be searching for a positive start to their Group F campaign, in an intriguing group that also contains Portugal and Armenia. Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has named a 23-man squad for the games against Hungary and Armenia, although there are some notable absences. Captain Seamus Coleman has been left out after being an unused substitute in Everton’s opening three Premier League matches this season. The experienced defender has not featured since withdrawing from the June friendlies through injury. Gavin Bazunu and Chiedozie Ogbene return to the squad after lengthy injury layoffs. Bazunu has recovered from knee surgery to reclaim his place at Southampton, while Ogbene is back for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in October 2024. Celtic defender Liam Scales is available to play after rolling his ankle against Rangers at the weekend, while Johnny Kenny has come in as attacking cover after Troy Parrott pulled out of the squad. Nathan Collins will captain the side in Coleman’s absence, with Caoimhín Kelleher providing experience in goal after his move from Liverpool to Brentford. However, Robbie Brady, Callum O’Dowda and Festy Ebosele all miss out through injury. Read – The mind-blowing numbers behind record-breaking transfer window Hungary manager Marco Rossi has named a larger-than-usual 27-man squad, including four potential debutants. The Italian coach has emphasised selecting players in good form, with Barna Tóth, Rajmund Molnár, Dániel Lukács and Bence Ötvös all earning their first call-ups. Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai will captain the side, with the 24-year-old having been Hungary’s talisman since taking over the armband in November 2022. However, there are concerns over Hungary’s over-reliance on their skipper, with the team struggling when he is marked out of games. Milos Kerkez, Willi Orbán and András Schäfer provide experience in the squad, while striker Barnabás Varga remains a key attacking threat. Rossi has stressed the importance of starting the campaign well against a physical Irish side.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp says U.S. labor workers won’t lose their jobs to AI—‘it’s not true’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-ai-wont-replace-labor-jobs/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T21:52:00Z
Full Content:
Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. As fears swirl that American manufacturing workers and skilled laborers may soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and robots, Alex Karp, CEO of the AI and data analytics software company Palantir Technologies, hopes to change the narrative. “It’s not true, and in fact, it’s kind of the opposite,” Karp said in an interview with Fortune Thursday at the company’s commercial customer conference, AIPCon, where Palantir customers showcased how they were using the company’s software platform and generative AI within their own businesses. The primary danger of AI in this country, says Karp, is that workers don’t understand that AI will actually help them in their roles—and it will hardly replace them. “Silicon Valley’s done an immensely crappy job of explaining that,” he said. “If you’re in manufacturing, in any capacity: You’re on the assembly line, you maintain a complicated machine—you have any kind of skilled labor job—the way we do AI will actually make your job more valuable and make you more valuable. But currently you would think—just roaming around the country, and if you listen to the AI narratives coming out of Silicon Valley—that all these people are going to lose their jobs tomorrow.” Karp made these comments the day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August jobs report, which showcased a climbing unemployment rate and stagnating hiring figures, reigniting fears of whether AI is at all responsible for the broader slowdown. There has been limited data thus far suggesting that generative AI is to blame for the slowing jobs market—or even job cuts for that matter—though a recent ADP hiring report offered a rare suggestion that AI may be one of several factors influencing hiring sentiment. Some executives, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, have cited the efficiency gains of AI for layoffs at their companies, and others, like Ford CEO Jim Farley and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, have made lofty predictions about how AI is on track to replace jobs in the future. Most of these projections have been centered around white collar roles, in particular, versus manufacturing or skilled labor positions. Karp, who has a PhD in neoclassical social theory and a reputation for being outspoken and contrarian on many issues, argues that fears of AI eliminating skilled labor jobs are unfounded—and he’s committed to “correcting” the public perception. Earlier this week, Palantir launched “Working Intelligence: The AI Optimism Project,” a quasi-public information and marketing campaign centered around artificial intelligence in the workplace. The project has begun with a series of short blog posts featuring Palantir’s customers and their opinions on AI, as well as a “manifesto” that takes aim at both the “doomers” and “pacifiers” of AI. “Doomers fear, and pacifiers welcome, a future of conformity: a world in which AI flattens human difference. Silicon Valley is already selling such bland, dumbed-down slop,” the manifesto declares, arguing that the true power of AI is not to standardize but to “supercharge” workers. Jordan Hirsch, who is spearheading the new project at Palantir, said that there are approximately 20 people working on it and that they plan to launch a corresponding podcast. While Palantir has an obvious commercial interest in dispelling public fears about AI, Karp framed his commitment to the project as something important for society. Fears about job replacement will “feed a kind of weird populism based on a notion that’s not true—that’s going to make the factions on the right and left much, much, much more powerful based on something that’s not true,” he said. “I think correcting that—but not just by saying platitudes, but actually showing how this works, is one of the most important things we have to get on top of.” Karp said he planned to invest “lots of energy and money” into the AI Optimism Project. When asked how much money, he said he didn’t know yet, but that “we have a lot of money, and it’s one of my biggest priorities.” Palantir has seen enormous growth within the commercial side of its business in the last two years, largely due to the artificial intelligence product it released in 2023, called “AIP.” Palantir’s revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time last quarter. And while Palantir only joined the S&P 500 last year, it now ranks as one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its soaring stock price. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Paramount’s new CEO tells employees to return to office full-time or quit ahead of layoffs
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/paramount-skydance-ceo-david-ellison-return-to-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T17:57:40Z

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Paramount CEO David Ellison, in one of his first companywide memos, demanded staff come back to the office five days a week or else find a new job. Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, became CEO of Paramount after its long-stalled $8 billion merger with Skydance was finalized last month. Since then, he has warned employees of efficiency changes, and said in an email that the new return-to-office mandate, which will be pushed out in phases starting January 2026, will “unlock Paramount’s full potential,” Fox News reported. But the mandate came with a not-so-subtle deadline: New York– or Los Angeles–based employees have until Sept. 15 to decide whether they will comply or take a buyout. The company will announce plans for employees based outside New York or L.A. in 2026, Ellison said in the email. “As I said during our town hall, some of the most formative moments of my life happened in rooms where I was a fly on the wall, listening and learning. I’ve never seen that happen on Zoom,” he wrote, according to Fox News. Paramount is the latest company to end COVID-era remote work policies as power shifts back to employers in the context of an increasingly worrying economic environment. Over the past year, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart have all told employees to get back to the office. At times these mandates have been slow to stick or have led to important losses, including for Walmart, which saw its Sam’s Club chief technology officer resign rather than move to the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. The return-to-office mandate comes as Paramount is reportedly preparing to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees in November now that the merger is approved and resolved. As of December 2024, the company had 18,600 employees, Variety reported. Paramount did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Paramount’s revenues for the first half of the year fell 3% year over year to $14 billion from $14.5 billion. The company reported a slight uptick in overall revenue for the second quarter, but saw a 6% decline in its cash cow TV media segment, which includes broadcast operations like CBS and cable networks, including Showtime and Nickelodeon. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Paramount+, increased 15% year over year thanks to a subscription boost and price increases. Post-merger, Paramount has sought deals to spur growth, especially for its streaming services. The company in July signed a $1.5 billion landmark deal to host the animated comedy South Park on Comedy Central and Paramount+ for five years. The company also signed a three-year deal with Legendary Entertainment to market and distribute its theatrical films globally, starting with the new Street Fighter film set to release next year. At the same time, executives previously said $2 billion in potential cost cuts could be realized under the combined company. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Not your father's Amazon

I'm always shocked when I remember Amazon got started way back in 1994. For more than a quarter century, this company was run by itsthe same founder, Jeff Bezos, who built it into America's second-largest employer. He pursued a dizzying array of products, services, businesses, moonshots, and side projects. Then, in the midst of a global pandemic, he stepped aside and Andy Jassy took over as CEO. Jassy was suddenly responsible for more than 1.5 million employees located all over the globe while COVID-19 spread. And he was taking the reins from a boss who'd stamped his unique approach on almost everything at Amazon. Daunting stuff. It's been over four years since then, and Jassy has finally made Amazon his own. That's according to an exclusive inside look at how this new CEO is changing the world's largest e-commerce and cloud company. Superstar reporter Eugene Kim spent many weeks on this project. If you're an Amazon employee, or you're thinking of working there, this is a must-read. Here are some highlights, but go read the whole thing: Costs Before Culture: When Jassy stepped into the top job in 2021, Amazon was ballooning from pandemic-era growth while suffering massive losses. The new CEO couldn't tackle cultural challenges until he first stabilized Amazon's cost structure. That meant big layoffs, project cuts, and tightening the belt at every level. "Arena" Leadership: Some leaders aren't mincing words. One high-level email obtained by Kim bluntly told managers to "step into the arena" and meet higher standards or leave. It's a tone that underscores a harder-edged, performance-first culture. From Spreading Bets to Big Bets: Jassy is rethinking how Amazon innovates. Unlike Bezos, who encouraged wide bets across hundreds of projects, Jassy is concentrating resources on a smaller number of "big bets" with clearer paths to profitability. The Petty Edge of Frugality: The company's legendary frugality now extends to the fine print. Some employees must track how much of a $50 phone allowance is actually work-related, with reimbursements adjusted accordingly. Owners, not employees: Jassy wants staff to think like owners. Would they spend their own money on this project, or that work trip? He sees Amazon as "the world's biggest startup," with a sharper, leaner culture. That's testing how far today's workforce is willing to go along for the ride. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com. Jump to
