Our expert games writer predicts the gaming trends for 2025, including Nintendo Switch 2, the rise of indie gaming, the impact of generative AI and how Unreal Engine 5 will shake things up . When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Predicting the gaming trends for 2025 starts with reflecting on what's happened in 2024. After another tumultuous year of layoffs and studio closures, many folks in the games industry will be staggering into 2025 with an understandable sense of anxiety. As while Epic Games has had a good year with Unreal Engine 5 and Nintendo continues to buck the trends, many studios have suffered. But there are some potential bright spots ahead. The launch of Nintendo Switch 2 (read our Switch 2 rumours feature for the latest info), the follow-up to the almighty Switch handheld, is sure to buoy the industry, as will the juggernaut that is GTA 6, even if it swallows attention from other titles like a black hole sucking in light. Yet there’s still that lingering sense of unease. Can new live-service games succeed in the market, given the disaster of Concord? Will generative AI improve games, or make things worse? Will Microsoft's Game Pass succeed, or are subscription services on the way out? In the midst of all this uncertainty, it’s perhaps comforting that games with relatively simple, old-school design are cutting through, like the excellent Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 and Still Wakes The Deep, indicating that bigger, more beautiful and more complicated worlds aren’t necessarily better, or even what players particularly want. The rise of 'AAA-lite' games, advances in AI for indie development, more cross-platform and cross-media games, as well perhaps a relaunch of classic IP as publishers play on nostalgia in the wake of Silent Hill 2: Remake's success, could all point to a better, more balanced year for games and indies. In light of all that, here are ten gaming trends and predictions to look out for in 2025. These include new launches, advances in tech, new ways of working and more. Anticipation is mounting for the follow-up to Nintendo’s mega-hit Switch console, which has sold more than 146 million units since its release in March 2017. Nintendo has said that an announcement on Switch 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will be made by the end of March 2025 at the latest, and we already know it will be backwards compatible with the Switch. Will Nintendo play it safe by essentially making another Switch with beefier specs and a better screen? Or will Nintendo follow past precedent by introducing some kind of new hardware gimmick? My money’s on some kind of dual-screen setup, toying with our love and nostalgia for Nintendo DS, but Nintendo does like to surprise us. Remember that alarm clock?

What seems almost certain is that we’ll get a new 3D Mario, probably as a launch title, since it’s been seven whole years since the last one, Super Mario Odyssey. And if we’re lucky, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond might make its long-awaited debut alongside the new console, ever since being teased at a Nintendo Direct earlier this year. Sony's live service shooter Concord was the biggest video-game flop of 2024, shut down just two weeks after its launch in August as a result of catastrophically low player counts. Sony later shuttered the game’s creator, Firewalk Studios, having only bought the studio in 2023. Earlier in the year, Warner Bros.’ Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made a similarly disappointing debut, showing that even licensed properties can struggle in vain to attract players away from well-established live-service titles such as Fortnite and GTAV. These high-profile failures are likely to make big publishers think twice about launching new live-service titles in 2025. At Sony, as reported in sister site Games Radar, The Last of Us Online has already been cancelled, but reportedly there’s still a Horizon MMO in the works: it remains to be seen whether it will live to see the light of day, given the Concord debacle. Sony also has at least two other live-service games lined up, currently without a firm release date: Marathon from Bungie, developer of Destiny 2 (read our deep dive into making the The Final Shape expansion), and Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios. Will they release in 2025? And can they fare any better? Concord has shown how difficult it is to launch new IP in the live-service space, but one game could potentially buck the trend: early feedback on Valve’s Deadlock has been positive from sister games site PCGamer, and there’s every chance it could burst out of beta in 2025. Microsoft reportedly had some lengthy internal debates (according to The Verge) about whether to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. Since the purchase of Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty has become Microsoft’s jewel in the crown, but shoving the new CoD game onto Microsoft’s subscription service would naturally mean sacrificing some hefty day-one sales on Xbox. The fact that it happened shows Microsoft is committed to making Game Pass succeed. Circana reported that Game Pass subscriptions surged on the release of Black Ops 6, but the big question is whether these new subscribers will stick around for the long haul. Expect to see older Call of Duty games being drip fed onto Game Pass over the next 12 months to keep these new subscribers interested. Microsoft has a lot coming to, and on, Game Pass, including the new Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle blockbuster, Stalker 2 and in 2025 Avowed from respected RPG team Obsidian Entertainment is come to the service, alongside Fable, DOOM: The Dark Ages and Gears of War E-Day. At the same time, Microsoft is pushing Game Pass onto as many devices as possible, including Samsung TVs and Amazon Fire Stick, backed by the confusing ‘This is an Xbox’ ad campaign. There's a clear strategy to move beyond hardware and release games across platforms, something other publishers are also looking into, including Sony with its PlayStation Plus subscription. But if subscriber numbers falter in 2025, this could signal the end of the Game Pass experiment: if Call of Duty can’t make subscribers stick around, then surely nothing can. The past two years have seen the release of a plethora of big-hitter VR and AR devices, including PSVR2, Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 (all featured in our best VR headsets roundup). But 2025 seems to be a bit quieter on the new hardware front. "We're unlikely to see Apple's next headset this year, though reports on the specific timeline are conflicted," says Henry Stockdale, staff writer at UploadVR. "Samsung's upcoming Android XR headset is also on the way, but that's reportedly been delayed,” he adds, meaning we’re increasingly unlikely to see it in 2025. But there’s an outside chance that Valve might spring a surprise. “We've recently seen controller models emerge on SteamVR for the rumoured Valve Deckard,” Henry says, referring to Valve’s long-in-gestation follow up to its Index VR headset from 2019. “Knowing Valve though, whether that's actually coming soon is anyone's guess.” Although Apple Vision Pro 2 might be a long way off, there’s a chance we could see a cheaper version of the Apple Vision headset by the end of the year, which could give Meta a headache, unless Quest 4 is incoming. The idea of creating generative-AI powered non-player characters (NPCs) has captivated some, who see it as a way to generate realistic, expansive conversations in place of characters that default to the same repeating phrases. Others, meanwhile, like Inkle’s Jon Ingold, merely regard it as a way of “creating an unworkable design purely to employ AI”. Whatever your viewpoint, we will start to see generative-AI powered NPCs emerge in 2025, such as the antagonist of Meaning Machine’s Dead Meat, a game that sees you posing questions to a large language model-powered suspect in an attempt to extract a murder confession. We might also start to see the first NPCs made using Nvidia ACE, which is now available as a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. We've already got to test Nvidia's character AI for games and it's actually remarkable, but also fallible and has revealed good writers will be in demand even with gen AI characters. Other major developers are experimenting with gen AI for game design and NPCs, ahead of them all seems to be Ubisoft, that could have a game out in 2025 which makes use of Nvidia Audio2Face AI, to create its own NEO NPC, as well as other AI apps. Read 'How Ubisoft’s New generative AI prototype changes the narrative for NPCs' for an insight. Since its release in 2013, GTA V has sold well over 200 million copies, and the launch of GTA 6 is set to upend all sales records, such is the demand for a sequel. Indeed, the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in 2025 was so momentous that it broke through the navel-gazing world of video games and into the world at large, making headlines on the BBC and other mainstream news channels. Accordingly, although GTA 6 is likely to lift the overall revenue of the games industry, its debut will be devastating for any games released in its wake. "No one will play anything else for six months after it," says Mike Rose, head of indie publisher No More Robots. "In the weeks, months after GTA 6 comes out, some people will never buy a game ever again. They'll play this game, and that will be it: it will become their Roblox." Sam Barlow, founder of Immortality maker Half Mermaid Productions, has noted the trend for more ambitious, open-world indie games like Sable and Tchia over the past few years, with “people stepping out of the assumptions around pixel art and two-dimensional things into more full-bodied 3D experiences”. He thinks this trend will continue in 2025, with indie developers using engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 6 to streamline many processes and create bigger worlds rather than making the prettiest games possible. "The cool thing with indies is, if you have more powerful machines and engines, it's not about maxing them out, it's just you can make things quicker". Indie auteur Sam Barlow isn't the first developer to say this, when we spoke with Anna Hollinrake about making her first game as an indie dev, the colourful open-world narrative game Crescent County, she revealed the move to Unreal Engine 5 made the larger world design, for a small team, possible. "We actually ended up making it too big," she told us. The EU Digital Markets Act has paved the way for rival app stores to come to iOS, and the Epic Game Store has already launched on Apple devices. “Unfortunately very few people seem to have noticed,” says Neil Long, founder of MobileGamer.biz, “and I’m not all that confident that even the promise of regular free games, like Epic offers through its PC store, will help.” Neil thinks that the monster hit Fortnite isn’t enough to tempt most people away from Apple’s own App Store, or Google’s equivalent. “Epic needs more killer content to get people to use its stores and make it clear why people should bother when the default iOS and Android stores do a solid job,” he says. Microsoft is also likely to launch its own app store in 2025. But Neil points out that the Redmond giant’s mobile strategy has been “all over the place”, so he isn’t confident that either Epic or Microsoft can attract sufficient customer numbers, “even though the market desperately needs new contenders to rein in Apple and Google, who are utterly dominant.” We've seen Apple itself push new mobile hardware to gamers, including seeing more Triple-A game releases on iPad, such Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 for iPhone. The mobile space is set to grow and become more important in 2025, and we've already seen both Unity and Unreal Engine 5.5 promote new tools for development on mobile platforms. There's a convergence happening with technology, as Unreal Engine and Unity become as useful outside of game development as within. We've seen in the past how Unreal us used to create immersive live experiences, such as Frameless in London that puts you into classic works of art and its use in filmmaking to drive LED Volume stages, the kind used by ILM for Star Wars. Just this month Felix & Paul Studios has announced a new 20,000-Square-Foot 'Interstellar Arc' mixed reality experience that will launch in Las Vegas in 2025 to rival the Las Vegas Sphere for tech and spectacle. This could lead to more virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality events launching in 2025, particularly as publishers look to leverage brands in new ways. Already an early contender to take your money, at least in the UK, is the upcoming Pac-Man Live experience that uses similar immersive tech as an Unreal Volume to out players into the Pac-Man maze as they're chased by augmented reality ghosts. Expect more immersive events in 2025 as gaming and game design evolves from the screen and into real life in new ways, especially with advances in AI like the Move AI's mocap 'Live' system that can capture movement and put it into scenes on a screen in real time. Sam Barlow notes that some of the biggest hits of the past year have relied on tried and tested design elements. “I mean, Metaphor: ReFantazio is pretty much literally a PS2 game in the way it’s set up,” he says, calling it “an extremely archaic RPG design” that is “extremely confident and polished in what it's doing”. He gives Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl as another example. “They're not even necessarily embracing a lot of the technical progress that's been made,” he says of the game that has dominated his recent playing time. “Stalker 2 is a 2000s PC game: it doesn't have cool, emergent physics, all the stuff that Zelda: Breath of the Wild did to innovate open world. It's not doing any of that. It's them going, ‘What if we made a 2000s PC game, but we can do 100 times as many trees?’.” Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which shot past 4.5 million sales in a month is an old-fashioned Xbox 360-style shooter that simply refines classic ideas and reworks them for new players. Its success, and that of other old-school new releases, shows that players seem happy to embrace simpler game design, perhaps even as a form of nostalgia. It’s likely other studios will take note and follow suit in 2025. The wake of team downsizing and studio closures, and soaring development costs, combined with 'smaller' games performing well in 2024, a big game design trend for 2025 will see the return of well-made, polished, smaller-scale games made on sustainable budgets with a blend of AAA ambition and indie sensibilities. Likewise, publishers will look at the buzz around brand revivals like Silent Hill 2, Dragon Quest III HD-2D and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and want to replicate those successes. We already have Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and The Thing Remastered from remaster specials Nightdive Studios, so expect something special from Sony in particular. While it's clear Nintendo Switch 2, generative AI, new tools for Unreal Engine 5, the rise of indies and more will happen in 2025, there are some outside chances of other things happening in video games.

Title: Godot Isn't Making it

Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment. Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling. It's unclear how much further this farce continues, if only because it isn't obvious what it is that anybody gets by investing in future rounds in OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other generative AI company. At some point they must make money, and the entire dream has been built around the idea that all of these GPUs and all of this money would eventually spit out something revolutionary. Yet what we have is clunky, ugly, messy, larcenous, environmentally-destructive and mediocre. Generative AI was a reckless pursuit, one that shows a total lack of creativity and sense in the minds of big tech and venture capital, one where there was never anything really impressive other than the amount of money it could burn and the amount of times Sam Altman could say something stupid and get quoted for it. I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what happens here. The future was always one that demanded that big tech spent more to make even bigger models that would at some point become useful, and that isn't happening. In pursuit of doing so, big tech invested hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure specifically to follow one goal, and put AI front and center at their businesses, claiming it was the future without ever considering what they'd do if it wasn't. The revenue isn't coming. The products aren't coming. "Orion," OpenAI's next model, will underwhelm, as will its competitors' models, and at some point somebody is going to blink in one of the hyperscalers, and the AI era will be over. Almost every single generative AI company that you’ve heard of is deeply unprofitable, and there are few innovations coming to save them from the atrophy of the foundation models. I feel sad and exhausted as I write this, drained as I look at the many times I’ve tried to warn people, frustrated at the many members of the media that failed to push back against the overpromises and outright lies of people like Sam Altman, and full of dread as I consider the economic ramifications of this industry collapsing. Once the AI bubble pops, there are no other hyper-growth markets left, which will in turn lead to a bloodbath in big tech stocks as they realize that they’re out of big ideas to convince the street that they’re going to grow forever. There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.

Title: The Scoop: Edelman cuts 5% of workforce

Also: UnitedHealthcare responds after CEO fatally shot during meeting; American adults view media as being as biased as ever. Edelman is laying off 330 staff members, or over 5% of its workforce, as part of a global restructuring effort. The global PR agency also plans to sunset several of its subsidiary boutique agencies. [RELATED: Craft compelling cross-platform content at the Social Media Strategy Certificate Course on Jan. 21, 28, & Feb. 4] As part of its company announcement, CEO Richard Edelman issued a statement to the company (and the broader industry) providing context about the “simplification of our firm’s structure.” “Clients now require integration of specialist services into the larger firm for speedy access to our geographic reach, deep industry knowledge and creative ability,” the statement reads. “We are best when we bring the full force of Edelman to the complex problems facing our clients. Corporate affairs, marketing and government affairs are now all closely aligned on the client side. We are skating to where the puck will be — everything is interconnected now.” As part of a restructuring, Edelman will shutter Edible, Revere, Salutem, Mustache, EGA and Delta brands. However, it plans to keep open three of its specialty arms: Edelman Smithfield (financial communications), DXI (research) and UEG (experiential marketing). Those boutique firms will serve as the “connective tissue” between Edelman and the related Zeno Group and RUTH. The agency will also maintain two client-specific entities — Assembly for Microsoft and Kinisi for J&J. Edelman plans to keep open its 60 global offices. Why it matters: Edelman is one of the biggest players in the PR game, and if it’s making a move, it’s important for the entire industry to take note. In this context, that appears to be moving – or “skating,” as Richard Edelman described it – toward a more integrated model. As Axios reported, Edelman is working “to take money away from classic marketing agencies and compete for budgets that [they] couldn’t have before.” But the changes are also about becoming more “nimble and agile.” While still a $1 billion revenue business, Edelman saw its revenue drop by about 8% last year – and further efficiency would likely help change that trend. It’s not clear if the growth of artificial intelligence is part of that changing model or the cuts in staff. But Edelman has emphasized its commitment to investing in its own AI technology. “We are investing in our own large language model premised on 25 years of Trust data that enables AI as a predictive tool, both communications and action, enabling better decisions by business related to trust,” Richard Edelman said. Following the downsizing, he told Axios positions affected by the downsizing “about evenly split” between “vice president and up” and “account executive to account supervisor.” But he also stressed in his company statement to deliver on client needs “with senior people leading every engagement.” That suggests the Edelman team really wants to use in-house staff time on strategy when and where possible. To that end, Edelman has hired over 200 creative employees in Colombia and plans to staff up in India and South Africa, per Axios. Keep an eye on next steps for Edelman, as it could be a strong sign of what’s in store for the industry. Editor’s Top News A newly released survey from the Pew Research Center suggests the overwhelming majority of American adults believe mainstream news coverage has a bias when discussing political or social issues. The September survey, which published Monday, found that 77% of U.S. adults believe news organizations tend to go either left or right when presenting on those topics. That number represents about nine-in-ten Republicans (88%), compared with 67% of Democrats. Far fewer (22%) believe news organizations deal fairly with all sides. The poll is near the highest share of Americans who say so since it started in 1985. In an era where people are increasingly turning to social media influencers and podcasts over traditional news, this poses a challenge for traditional earned media. Trust is key, and if a team can’t trust the reporter or their perspective on a particular subject, it won’t resonate with target audiences as it should. This doesn’t mean you should give up on your earned media strategy entirely. But now, as much as ever, PR teams must thoroughly vet the reporters and publications and closely examine sentiment scores. Casey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn. Topics: Daily Scoop Topics: Daily Scoop As someone familiar with Edelman, I can confirm the number is closer to 500 employees. Considering the company’s reported financial challenges, there’s been speculation among staff about the necessity and timing of Nikki Haley’s hire three months ago, given that her compensation is likely significant.

Title: Cushman & Wakefield’s Joanne Podell Explains Retail’s Dramatic Changes
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/12/cushman-wakefield-joanne-podell-retail-real-estate/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T11:00:44Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With 25 years of experience and retail deals the scale of which would make an office broker’s eyes pop, there are few better to ask about the state of today’s brick-and-mortar leasing environment than Joanne Podell. The executive vice chair for retail services at Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) sat down with Commercial Observer shortly before Thanksgiving to talk about all the travails the industry has been through in the last several years, putting into perspective the ups and downs that have taken place and pointing out that it’s a good time to be a retail broker. Some of Podell’s biggest clients include TD Bank, which she assisted in its expansion in the New York City market by adding over 50 new locations, as well as Nike when in 2016 Podell negotiated a 70,000-square-foot lease for its flagship at 650 Fifth Avenue. Most recently, Podell (pronounced “Poh-DELL”) helped Chinese retailer Miniso in its New York City expansion with a 5,000-square-foot deal at 150 Broadway in June. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Is the retail apocalypse officially over? Joanne Podell: I think there never was one. What a terrible word, and there’s so many circumstances around it that we have to consider. I mean, the world fell apart, so retail is just a part of everything else that was happening — theater, tourism. It was a terrible confluence of lots of different things. Thrown in there was everybody shopping online, and how is that going to affect everything? From the beginning, the National Retail Federation and people like me were saying, “Yeah, e-commerce will definitely take some of the retail business, but also enhance the retail business.” Because people go online, they look at what they like, and some of them want to just go into a store and take a look at it, right? Then there’s what they call the halo effect of retail that goes online, where people walk into a store, they shop around, they go home, and they order something online. So, you know, it’s amorphous. It’s very hard to just define it the way that “apocalypse” was used. That was silly. Who were the retailers who survived it and why? The ones that struggled the most and still do are because of the office. Most affected were those in food and beverage, obviously, because people are in the office three or four days instead of five. But if a woman wants a coat, she’s an office worker, she’s in New York, then she’s going to shop Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday for the coat, right? It’s not like she’s never going to buy it. So I think F&B was hurt. But every restaurant is packed all the time, and the bars are packed all the time. So F&B is back. It seems like when it comes to F&B, when one restaurant closes, another opens quickly in its place? It’s usually the second or third generation of the restaurant that ends up making it, and that’s unfortunate. And the reason is the costs to build out, and get the licensing and permitting, are just prohibitive. So the guy that gets the space the next, he’s got all of that in place. That’s why second-generation restaurants lease very quickly, because oftentimes the equipment is there. If it’s not, all the fittings are there. And so it’s an easy transition for the second or third restaurant. That’s too bad, because some of these poor guys, they put their heart and soul, their savings, into building something, and then the next guy gets the benefit. Tell us about some of your more interesting recent deals. My business has changed a little bit. We were doing a lot of flagships, and so that’s a great business, but now it seems like we have a steady flow of a variety of deals. We represent Miniso out of China, and we’re building a portfolio for them slowly. They had considered doing a flagship, and they said, “You know what? That’s not the direction we want to go.” We represent Citizens Bank. We’re very carefully looking at their portfolio and where they need to move if their leases are up or if they need to stay where they are. Luxottica, we represented them, it was filling in where they were missing stores. So it continues to be the steady flow of the retailers that we work with. We also represent landlords, and I actually love the balance of representing a landlord and a tenant. You get a much better perspective of the market. You see what landlords are willing to do, how they feel that they can create deals and get them done. It’s a good part of the business, so we do that as well. A lot of the recent buyers of New York retail properties are foreign buyers. Why is that? You stabilize what your rent is going to be from a retailer’s point of view. Here’s a negative and why people never bought: It’s because your program changes. For the first couple of years, you’re an apparel store, you include shoes and handbags, right? Then you figure out, “I’m not getting an ROI on that as much as I should. What do I need that big of a store for? I’ll streamline my store 20 percent, I’ll pay less rent. I’m going to do fine.” So they don’t buy, they lease, so they have that flexibility. Not the same when you buy, but when you buy — and you’re a conglomerate, you can buy a building — you could break it up for multiple tenants. Kering’s purchase of 715-717 Fifth Avenue, right? They have 13 brands, so they’re in a position where if one brand doesn’t work, they’ll put another brand in. But single-brand ownership doesn’t make any sense at all. So it’s very unique that they buy. Are foreign buyers leasing space too, or are they just buying? There’s tremendous interest, but they’re not just buying, they’re coming again to lease. The foreign companies are coming back — particularly the Chinese companies. We have another company that’s coming in, too. They’re here already and they’re going to expand in a more significant way. I can’t tell you the name yet. China is becoming an interesting place to look for retail. One of the things that hurt retail after the pandemic was that the Chinese investors and tourists did not come back quickly. Are tenant-owners expanding outside of New York? They have to grow their business. That’s their job. If they don’t, it tanks their stock. So they’re out there making, hopefully, very good decisions on expansion, and that’s a great thing, because all of that leads to more jobs, more manufacturing, hopefully some of it in the U.S. The malls, very competitive. We are working on getting space for Miniso in some of the local malls, and there is tremendous competition for space. Look at the investment from American companies in retail. Look at Acadia. They’re a great company. They’re buying a lot of retail. Empire State Realty Trust — for years, you never heard about them buying retail, it was really about maintaining and redoing the Empire State Building and maintaining a very strong office portfolio. They just bought a bunch of retail property in Williamsburg. Are there any neighborhoods that haven’t bounced back? The city is so strong, I would give you an answer if I knew one. I don’t know what’s not bouncing back. It seems like it’s hard to find good space in most residential markets, and certainly you look at Flatiron, SoHo — very strong. Financial District, Downtown — good activity there as well. Can we finally stop talking about experiential retail? Many years ago, department stores had makeup departments, right? And we’re talking about 25 years ago. You would go in there, and a woman behind the counter would say, “Try this lipstick.” What is that? That is and always was experiential retail. If you want to take it all the way to the other side, Nike with a basketball court, sure, very nice. But is it critical, or that important? No. I think a good product, good inventory, good service — those are the things that make retail successful, and understanding who your customer is, which probably is the No. 1 thing to mention. There’s been a big culling of retail brokers in the last few years. What are the effects of that on the market? I don’t know that there were layoffs, as this is a very hard business. It takes a long time to be good at it, and this is not about ego, because you don’t have to be a genius to be in this business. But it takes perseverance. It takes a willingness to work very hard to be successful. I think the layoffs come from people who recognize that this is not the business for them. It literally can take five years before someone can make a decent living. And you ask any broker, they’re going to tell you the same thing: It takes years to learn this business. And not to disparage other kinds of brokerage, but retail is so unique, the nuances in retail require a different knowledge base. You need to know this market and, as the market changes, you have to recognize the changes in the market. You have to be aware of all the different kinds of tenants that are coming into the market, and then you need to work hard and build relationships. When I started, I worked seven days a week. I walked the streets, I met lots of other brokers like myself. That’s a very different thing than other kinds of businesses. How can a young broker get their foot in the door? It really depends on the mindset of the broker. Do they want to work by themselves and maybe represent a few people? For me, I could never do the job well if I didn’t have a big team — we do a lot of work in terms of providing information. You know, information is king. It’s not acceptable or viable for a tenant or a landlord to make a decision without knowing what’s going on in the market, what else is available, and the types of companies that are out there. How am I going to know all that? Every senior broker has a different perspective, so I can only speak for myself. I don’t want anybody coming to work knowing they’re not going to walk away with $1 at the end of the day. So, for me, I’d rather make sure that my guys have a salary of some kind or a draw. I think it’s important. I’m not talking about getting them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but you’ve got to do that. It’s also your obligation as a senior broker, someone who’s been in the business a long time, you got to train these people. You got to teach them. They have to learn. They have to be part of your life, they have to be in your office, listening to conversations, learning about negotiation. All those things take time. What does it mean for the brokers who survived the last eight years or so? I think that if you’re hardworking and you like what you do, you can be great at it. It’s just your commitment. What role does data play for you? I love information. I love data. I think 20-something years ago, I think I was one of the first people to hire someone with a clicker to count how many people walked in front of a store. I desperately believe that without data, you can’t do a good job. You can’t provide enough information to your client. At the end of the day, I always tell people the same thing: It’s intuition and information. You need the historical information of that neighborhood. You can get specific information, but the nuances of the neighborhood — that street is always too dark or that one tenant that’s been there forever is really never leaving. The things that don’t show up in Placer.ai data come from you being on the street and understanding it. As for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the market there still going to continue in the direction it’s been heading for the last 10 years or so? ESRT just invested a lot of money there. Acadia owns property there, right? It’s a good trading area. And I think as long as the rents stay realistic, you’ve got a good demographic. What are rents like compared to before the pandemic? In some cases, we’re almost back. In some cases, it is over. Certain neighborhoods are stable. Because there’s no particular new growth, tenants can only pay so much. There’s no new development that would cause everybody to say, “Oh my god, there’s going to be additional traffic coming there, right?” So they stay pretty much the same. Flatiron, those rents came back so quickly, but they are all stable because of the same thing. One of the problems that we had historically, which we certainly had a number of years ago, was places like Flatiron got just too expensive. You need tenants to stay in business. It’s not a good look for people to go out of business because they can’t afford the rent. That’s probably my biggest concern. I know it’s counterintuitive, because brokers get paid on bigger deals, but I want people to stay in business. Now people need security, that’s tough. Theft is at a higher number than it was before. So those are the challenges that we have. Organized retail theft has been a problem for several years now. Do you think the situation is improving? I think 34th Street looks much better. There was a good amount of time after the pandemic when it was just awful. I think the business improvement district, they’ve done an amazing job. Look, I don’t want to be political, but I can tell you that it appears to me that it looks better. Fifth Avenue — recently I saw some poor families there, but I’m not seeing what I used to see. What do you think of some of the chains like Foot Locker, Red Lobster and Blink Fitness filing for bankruptcy? There’s always bankruptcy. That’s normal. Some people make good decisions and commit the right amount of money to growth and to development, and they can outlive their competition. Jeff Bezos said this and I totally believe it: Everybody will go bankrupt at some point, including Amazon. Now to the casino in Times Square — what do you think of that? Is it good or is it bad? I think if there is going to be a casino, it should be there. I think it’s the right place and I understand the challenges to the office market, and I recognize that we have to increase security for it. There’s a lot that has to be done to make it work. But the amount of revenue that would come from it would be just crazy. And the city could use it. It’d be a lot better than charging $9 for people to drive into Manhattan below 60th Street. People are afraid. There are beautiful office buildings there, and I guess the folks in the office buildings are a little concerned, but I don’t think they should be. With the right amount of police and sanitation, I think it could be a boon for New York. I’ve been going to ICSC Las Vegas every year for about 30 years, and I’ve never put a quarter in a machine. Some people are gamblers, and they enjoy it, and that’s fine, and some people just don’t find it interesting. I don’t think the whole world is going to turn to gambling just because they open a casino. Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

Advancements to AI could play a key role in the gaming industry's future, Hermen Hulst says. By Eddie Makuch on December 3, 2024 at 8:45AM PST According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans. "Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the BBC. He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content." There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason why video game voice actors are now on strike and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize. Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook. The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard! Log in to comment

Title: It's a really bad time to be a middle manager

America is undergoing a rapid corporate restructuring — and middle managers are in big trouble Over the past two years, American businesses have been engaged in a rapid-fire restructuring of their corporate hierarchies. In the name of "flattening," they've been waging war on middle managers — trimming an entire tier of supervisory jobs that Mark Zuckerberg derided as nothing more than "managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work." Following Meta's lead, Citi reduced its 13 layers of management to eight. UPS axed 12,000 of its 85,000 managers. And in September, Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. "I hate bureaucracy," CEO Andy Jassy declared, echoing the zeal for "efficiency" that Elon Musk, one of the pioneers of the current corporate flattening, is now seeking to unleash on the halls of government. But here's the thing: It's not just that tens of thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. It's that the jobs themselves have been eliminated — and they may not be coming back. To test that theory, I asked Revelio Labs, a workforce analytics provider, to crunch the numbers for me, using its database of job postings aggregated from across the internet. It divided employees into two buckets of managers (senior leadership and middle management) and two buckets of lower-level employees (experienced associates and junior workers). Then it looked at how many job openings employers are posting today, compared with the hiring heyday of 2022. What the data reveals is stark. Earlier this year, when white-collar hiring was at its lowest point, openings for junior roles — entry-level positions requiring little to no prior experience — were down by 14%. But hiring had plunged by 43% for middle managers and 57% for senior leaders. If you had any sort of management experience, your job prospects were bleak. Since then, though, we've seen a significant rebound in job postings for almost everyone — except middle managers. In October, employers were still advertising 42% fewer middle-management positions than they did in April 2022. Which means that those who lost their jobs in the Great Flattening are now facing a whole new horror: There aren't any positions left for them to take. The assault on middle managers dates back to the 1980s, when globalization gave rise to a new philosophy of management that prioritized cost cutting over everything else. Supervisors — earning big salaries for rubber-stamping the work of their subordinates — became an easy target. Trim the fat, the thinking went, and the efficiencies will follow. From 1986 to 1998, one study found, the number of managers reporting to division heads dropped by 25%. At the same time, the number of managers reporting directly to a CEO nearly doubled. Executives got the flattening that they wanted. But it's unclear whether getting rid of middle managers actually made companies run more efficiently. As I wrote last year, one study found that businesses with fewer layers of management were able to deliver their products faster. But study after study found that when middle managers do their jobs right, they bolster performance more than either top executives or ground-level employees. Supervisors do real work. They motivate. They mentor. They communicate critical information to and from different parts of the company. They smooth out glitches and spot opportunities. They're the ones who keep the trains running. But now is an especially bad time to be an experienced supervisor. According to an analysis by Live Data Technologies, another workforce analytics provider, middle managers made up 32% of layoffs last year, compared with 20% in 2019. And as the data from Revelio Labs shows, companies appear to have no intention of refilling those supervisory roles, even as they resume hiring for lower-level jobs. That has created a double whammy for middle managers: There's a sharp spike in job seekers, and they're competing for an increasingly small universe of open roles. Over the past year I've heard from hundreds of managers mired in this double whammy. What's struck me is how eerily similar their stories are. They all come across as smart and articulate. They're all in their late 40s to 50s. When they got laid off from their supervisory jobs, they didn't expect their job search to be too difficult. After all, they'd spent decades honing their skills and climbing the corporate ladder, often at leading companies. Surely, all that experience had to count for something. But despite sending out hundreds of applications, they can't get anyone to return their calls. They're utterly baffled, and they all have the same question: What is going on here? It's the question I've been asking, too — combing through government data, talking to employers and economists, studying applicant-tracking systems. Because so many of the frustrated job seekers are older, I thought maybe we were seeing some new form of age discrimination: Call it the Curse of the Gen X Professional. But it's only after seeing the data from Revelio Labs that I finally understand what's going on: There just aren't enough supervisory jobs to go around anymore. In response, many displaced managers have swallowed their pride and started applying to jobs lower on the corporate food chain. As Revelio Labs' data shows, nonmanagerial jobs are faring much better these days — and you'd think companies would be thrilled to get the experience and know-how of seasoned professionals on the cheap. But take the example of a former middle manager I'll call Rick, who is 54. After getting rejected for all the supervisory jobs he could find, he widened his search to include entry-level positions — only to be rejected for being overqualified. At this point, all Rick wants is a chance to prove himself. "Forget the titles, forget all that other stuff," he told me. "I just need a job. My unemployment runs out in about 30 days. I'll come in and do a great job for you." This is the paradox that lies at the heart of the Great Flattening: The very experience that should be a selling point for senior leaders has become a liability. Some have tried deleting former jobs from their resumes, to hide their supervisory experience. Others, like Rick, omit the year they graduated from college. One former chief operating officer, whose search has gone so poorly that she's now applying to be an executive assistant, told me she addresses her overqualified-ness in her cover letters. "I understand that my résumé has some big titles on it, but let me tell you who I am at heart," she writes. "I really want to be doing this, and I'm not wedded to the title." What all the out-of-work managers want to know is: When is the hiring freeze for supervisors going to thaw? That depends, in large part, on whether companies come to view the flattening as a success. Many CEOs insist they aren't getting rid of middle managers just to save money. They think having fewer layers of management will, as Zuckerberg put it, create a "stronger" company that can build "higher-quality products faster." That hints at a dark prospect for managers like Rick: The rung of the corporate ladder they spent their careers reaching could be gone for good. There's a chance, of course, that the current craze for corporate flattening could ease over time. Companies are already discovering that having few middle managers is placing an enormous strain on their operations. The supervisors who survived the purge have been forced to take on much larger teams, and they're burned out to a crisp. Gen Zers, deprived of their mentors, are increasingly disengaged. Departments are more siloed than ever, with no one to do the tedious and thankless and essential work of coordinating across different teams. The best hope for managers like Rick is that CEOs are getting a real-time refresher in the value of managers. "I'm not at that point in my life where I'm ready to take that step back," Rick told me. "I just want to work with good people and enjoy what I'm doing. I could go to Domino's and start delivering pizza. But I know I can do a lot more than that."
