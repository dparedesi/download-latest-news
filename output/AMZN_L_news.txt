Title: Hollywood's big boom has gone bust
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6er83ene6o
Time Published: 2024-09-28T23:18:00Z

Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood’s golden age of streaming. The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he’s on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. “We were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,” he says. “Two years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." “Now I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.” For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood’s writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they’re not eligible or they’ve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means less new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn’t sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don’t pay for cable TV funded by commercials. “The air has come out of the content bubble,” says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. “Crisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.” Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. “It caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,” Mr Belloni says. “Netflix crashed – all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered – but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.” And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. “The entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,” Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a “cornerstone” of the city’s economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. “What makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,” he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood “always thinks it’s in crisis,” he says. “It is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.” Mr Fortin’s drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he’s flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. “It was a great wave, and it crashed,” Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. “Things are coming in little by little,” he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. “Hollywood gave me everything,” he says. “But it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.” The celebrated singer-songwriter was also famous for acting roles in A Star is Born and Blade. At least 105 people have died nationwide, as officials airdrop supplies to devastated areas of the US south-east. The proposed legislation would have imposed some of the first US regulations on artificial intelligence. The fire at a BioLab facility in Conyers has forced road closures and evacuation orders.

Title: Dell says sales team must work on-site 5 days a week to drive productivity
URL: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/dell-says-sales-team-must-work-on-site-5-days-a-week-to-drive-productivity/

Most members of Dell’s sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, Reuters reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping “grow skills,” per the note. Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have posted online (The Register reported that the post “mirrors” one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren’t required to go into an office but “should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.” The policy doesn’t apply to “remote sales team members,” but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers “in the coming weeks.” Bloomberg reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell’s president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying: … our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite. Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team’s culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like “real-time feedback” and “dynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said. Notably, the letter, which was reportedly sent to workers on Thursday, doesn’t give employees much time for adjustments. The memo acknowledges that workers have built schedules around working from home regularly but doesn’t offer immediate solutions. In a statement to The Register, a Dell spokesperson confirmed the policy change. “We continually evolve our business so we’re set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," they said. "That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership." After permitting full-time remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February, Dell started requiring workers to go into the office 39 days per quarter (or about three days per week) or be totally remote. The latter, however, seemed discouraged, as Dell reportedly told remote workers they were ineligible for promotions in March. Still, nearly 50 percent of Dell workers chose to stay remote, Business Insider reported in June, citing internal Dell Data. Dell’s return-to-office (RTO) mandates have reportedly been enforced with VPN and badge tracking. Some employees have accused Dell of trying to reduce headcount with RTO policies. Other companies pushing workers back into offices have also been accused of this; there’s research showing that at least some companies have used RTO policies to lower headcount while avoiding layoffs. Dell laid off 13,000 people in 2023 and plans more layoffs. In August, it announced plans to lay off an undisclosed additional number of people. The company is expected to have 120,000 employees. Dell’s RTO change follows an announcement this week requiring Amazon employees to work on-site five days a week starting next year. Following the announcement, a survey of 2,585 US Amazon employees found that 73 percent of Amazon workers are “considering looking for an another job” in response. The memo, according to Reddit, acknowledges to workers, “Yes, this is a shift from current expectations.” Dell’s RTO push represents an about-face from previously stated positions on remote work from the company. In 2022, for example, CEO and founder Michael Dell wrote a blog that said Dell “found no meaningful differences” between remote and on-site workers, including before the pandemic. Dell COO Jeff Clarke made similar arguments in 2020. The idea that remote work hinders productivity has been a hot topic of debate, especially as companies grapple with their remote work policies following pandemic restrictions. Dell says that its decision to force sales workers back into offices is backed by data, and its claims of boosted productivity could potentially be true when it comes to this specific Dell division. However, there have also been studies suggesting that return-to-office mandates hurt productivity. For example, a Great Place to Work survey conducted in July 2023 of 4,400 employees concluded that “productivity was lower for both on-site and remote employees when their employer mandated where they work.” Workers with companies allowing employees to choose between remote and on-site work were more likely to give “extra effort," the survey found.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin’ As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse

(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra “Stay Alive Until 2025” is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney’s Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit’s films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn’t enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of at least $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven’t spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney’s ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent exits by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN’s President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a recent memo will make the company “more strategic, collaborative and nimble” while resulting in “new positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.” Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men’s basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure’s University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry’s many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely won’t close until well into 2025. Nonetheless, Paramount’s three-headed Office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney’s. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company’s main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service’s eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating on a stand-alone basis after the merger finally closes. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially given the many overlapping operations with Skydance in film, TV and animation production. But it’s all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T’s spotty previous stewardship). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal’s new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, a burgeoning wireless carrier, and theme parks. It’s useful to view the imminent (and entirely self-driven) retirement of beloved Today Show Hoda Kotb this week, with her $20-million-a-year contract, as just one example of what’ll be happening with NBC News salaries for on-air personalities as contracts come up for negotiation. More big names are likely to move on, or eat a pay cut or minimal pay hike in the new era. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs “more effectively” to “fuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.” Hollywood’s biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive — even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn’t include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. The mediacos are feeling Wall Street pressure to turn streaming services into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the accelerating swoon in customers watching the companies’ legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. Now it’s reportedly reconsidering the cost-plus approach to its talent deals, going back to a modified version of a flat fee with an actual back-end for successful projects (only). But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company’s most-watched shows of 2024’s first half, according to Netflix’s recent release of viewership statistics. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That’ll likely be huge for Netflix viewership, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games’ rights won’t be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that’s good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that’s also money that won’t be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios. Keeping a job in film and television seemingly has never been more difficult.

Hi, what are you looking for? From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media has been hit with blow. By Published From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media landscape has been hit with blow after blow. World News Day, taking place on Saturday with the support of hundreds of organisations including AFP, aims to raise awareness about the challenges endangering the hard-pressed industry. – ‘Broken business model’ – In 2022, UNESCO warned that “the business model of the news media is broken”. Advertising revenue — the lifeline of news publications — has dried up in recent years, with Internet giants such as Google and Facebook owner Meta soaking up half of that spending, the report said. Meta, Amazon and Google’s parent company Alphabet alone account for 44 percent of global ad spend, while only 25 percent goes to traditional media organisations, according to a study by the World Advertising Research Center. Platforms like Facebook “are now explicitly deprioritising news and political content”, the Reuters Institute’s 2024 Digital News Report pointed out. Traffic from social to news sites has sharply declined as a result, causing a drop in revenue. Few are keen to pay for news. Only 17 percent of people polled across 20 wealthy countries said they had online news subscriptions in 2023. Such trends, leading to rising costs, have resulted in “layoffs, closures, and other cuts” in media organisations around the world, the study found. – Eroding trust – Public trust in the media has increasingly eroded in recent years. Only four in 10 respondents said they trusted news most of the time, the Reuters Institute reported. Meanwhile, young people are relying more on influencers and content creators than newspapers to stay informed. For them, video is king, with the study citing the influence of TikTok and YouTube stars such as American Vitus Spehar and Frenchman Hugo Travers, known for his channel HugoDecrypte. – Growing disinformation – The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed concerns about disinformation — rife on social platforms — as the tool can generate convincing text and images. In the United States, partisan websites masquerading as media outlets now outnumber American newspaper sites, the research group NewsGuard, which tracks misinformation, said in June. “Pink slime” outlets — politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets — are largely powered by AI. This appears to be an effort to sway political beliefs ahead of the US election. As part of a national crackdown on disinformation, Brazil’s Supreme Court suspended access to Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. The court accused the social media platform of refusing to remove accounts charged with spreading fake news, and flouting other judicial rulings. “Eradicating disinformation seems impossible, but things can be implemented,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) editorial director Anne Bocande told AFP. Platforms can bolster regulation and create news reliability indicators, like RSF’s Journalism Trust Initiative, Bocande said. – Alarming new player – AI has pushed news media into unchartered territory. US streaming platform Peacock introduced AI-generated custom match reports during the Paris Olympics this year, read with the voice of sports commentator Al Michaels — fuelling fears AI could replace journalists. Despite these concerns, German media giant Axel Springer has decided to bet on AI while refocusing on its core news activities. At its roster, which includes Politico, the Bild tabloid, Business Insider and Die Welt daily, AI will focus on menial production tasks so journalists can dedicate their time to reporting and securing scoops. In a bid to profit from the technology’s rise, the German publisher as well as The Associated Press and The Financial Times signed content partnerships with start-up OpenAI. But the Microsoft-backed firm is also caught in a major lawsuit with The New York Times over copyright violations. – ‘Quiet repression’ – With journalists frequently jailed, killed and attacked worldwide, “repression is a major issue,” said RSF’s Bocande. A total of 584 journalists are languishing behind bars because of their work — with China, Belarus and Myanmar the world’s most prolific jailers of reporters. The war in Gaza sparked by Palestinian militant group Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel has already left a “terrible” mark on press freedom, Bocande added. More than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since October 7, 2023, including 32 while “in the exercise of their duties”. She said a “quiet repression” campaign is underway in countries around the world, including in democracies — with investigative journalism hampered by fresh laws on national security.

Cameron Moseley hopes never to return to jail thanks to a pioneering scheme in London that aims to cut reoffending by training former prisoners.

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, “Working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,” as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, “Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,” Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year. In response to these financial headwinds, Dell signalled its intention to implement strategic cost-cutting measures in a regulatory filing submitted on September 11. “We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs."

Editions: En/basketball/nba ESPN cuts ties with Zach Lowe Zach Lowe is a well-known figure in the basketball world, celebrated for his sharp analysis and insightful commentary on the NBA. As a senior writer for ESPN, he built a reputation over his more than ten years with the network, having first joined Bill Simmons' Grantland in 2012. Lowe's journey through the world of sports journalism has been marked by his keen understanding of the game, as well as his ability to break down complex strategies in a way that fans can appreciate. He also hosted the popular Lowe Post podcast and frequently appeared on NBA Today, making him a familiar face to basketball enthusiasts everywhere. Unfortunately, the latest buzz in sports media reveals that Lowe is no longer with ESPN. According to Andrew Marchand from The Athletic, Lowe's dismissal was part of a wave of layoffs that has recently hit the network, which also saw notable departures like Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder just before the football season kicked off. Reports suggest that Lowe's salary-over a million dollars a year-was a significant factor in the decision to let him go. As one insider noted, "His salary was the biggest factor in his dismissal from ESPN," highlighting the tough choices networks face in today's changing media landscape. Despite this setback, there might be a silver lining for Lowe. With NBC and Amazon ramping up their NBA coverage in anticipation of new rights agreements in 2025, opportunities could be on the horizon. Both networks are keen to bring in top-notch talent, and Lowe's experience and credibility in the field make him a prime candidate for their future plans. Interestingly, this shake-up in the sports media world comes on the heels of a surprising announcement from another basketball luminary, Adrian Wojnarowski. Woj, ESPN's lead NBA reporter, revealed his departure to become the general manager of St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team. In a heartfelt message posted on X, he shared, "This craft transformed my life," expressing his appreciation for the journey that sports journalism has taken him on. As for Lowe, while the road ahead may seem uncertain, his contributions to the NBA discourse have been invaluable, and his passion for the game will surely lead him to new and exciting ventures. The basketball community will be watching closely to see where this talented writer lands next. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us

Title: Amazon Employees Are Overwhelmingly ‘Dissatisfied’ With CEO Andy Jassy’s RTO Mandate

The majority of Amazon (AMZN) employees are overwhelmingly unhappy with CEO Andy Jassy’s new return-to-office (RTO) mandate and are considering looking for new jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by Team Blind, an anonymous social platform for verified tech workers. A poll of more than 2,500 Amazon employees found that 91 percent are “dissatisfied” with the new five-day in-office policy, which will come into effect in January 2025. “My morale for this job is gone,” one said in a post. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Like most other tech companies, Amazon embraced remote work during the pandemic and has since reverted to a three-day in-office policy. Now, in an effort to rebuild the company’s culture and boost collaboration, Jassy’s RTO measure will only allow employees to work from home under extenuating circumstances like illnesses. The change will help ensure Amazon operates “like the world’s largest startup,” according to the CEO. Amazon employees don’t appear to share Jassy’s sentiments. Blind’s survey was conducted between Sept. 17 (a day after Jassy announced the RTO mandate) to Sept. 19 and found that three quarters of polled workers are considering looking for another job because of the new policy, while 32 percent said they know someone who has quit recently in response to Jassy’s mandate. Amazon’s HR is scrambling to fill the void. “I just had an Amazon recruiter blow up my phone and inbox five times in the last 24 hours to get me to provide my availability for an onsite interview,” said a Microsoft (MSFT) employee on Blind, adding that the recruiter said hiring managers are frustrated by the amount of Amazon candidates who have dropped out of interview processes in response to the news. For Amazon employees who were hired remotely, some are viewing the mandate as a thinly veiled strategy to cut headcount. The company’s workforce reportedly surged by nearly 75 percent between March 2020 and September 2021 alone. “Many of those folks are concerned that they don’t live anywhere close to an office, and they were hired with the expectation of being remote,” Rick Chen, Blind’s head of public relations, told Observer. Only a small percentage of employees are okay with RTO, with 9 percent saying they are “satisfied” with Jassy’s mandate. “There were some defenders of the policy, folks that prefer to work in the office and disliked remote work,” said Chen, who noted that a few Amazon employees also suggested that the end of remote work was caused by a few “bad apples'” who “ruined it for everyone by taking quiet vacations or slacking off.” Another trending response to Amazon’s RTO policy is concern amongst other Big Tech workers that their company is next. In addition to worried employees from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL), all of which also currently have a three-day in-office policy, Microsoft professionals—who are allowed to work remotely 50 percent of the time—have overwhelmingly voiced concerns that Microsoft will follow Amazon’s lead, according to Chen. This could be due to a geographic connection, as both Amazon and Microsoft are based near Seattle, Wash., he said. Such comments echo those made in 2022 and 2023 when large tech companies announced layoffs one after the other, said Chen. “The was a feeling among professionals then, and it’s resurfacing now, that these companies are moving in lockstep with one another.” Blind has noticed an unusual uptick in search volume for the term “RTO” since Jassy’s announcement. While the phrase was previously searched by 500 employees on a daily basis at the beginning of 2024, that figure has since doubled this month to 1,000, Chen said. Other keywords like “remote work” and “flexible work” have also gained popularity in lieu of previously common search terms like “layoffs,” “manager” and “promotion.” “It’s a very extreme shift in terms of what is capturing Amazon professionals’ mind space right now,” said Chen.

Title: ESPN Laid Off Zach Lowe In Latest Shakeup To Their NBA Coverage

In the past year-plus, ESPN has made some massive changes to their NBA coverage team. A year ago, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson were all let go as part of company-wide layoffs. Doc Rivers stepped in to the lead booth along with Doris Burke but left for the Bucks head coaching job midseason. JJ Redick was elevated into Rivers’ spot, but promptly took the Lakers job at the end of the season. Most recently, the league’s top newsbreaker, Adrian Wojnarowski, announced his shocking retirement to go work for his beloved alma mater, St. Bonaventure. With Woj already gone, another bomb dropped on Thursday when The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand brought word that ESPN was also laying off its top NBA writer and podcaster, Zach Lowe. Per Marchand, Lowe being let go falls in line with the Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder departures earlier this year, as Lowe made north of seven figures annually and was fired for budget reasons. Lowe was the most prominent NBA writer not only on ESPN’s staff, but arguably in the entire league. Beyond his written work, Lowe’s podcast, The Lowe Post, has been extremely popular and he has been a regular contributor on TV with NBA Today and other studio shows. Lowe had been at ESPN for more than a decade, starting his career at Grantland and then moving over to the dot com after they shuttered the Bill Simmons-led site. As such, many would expect the Ringer to be a potential landing spot for Lowe, who immediately becomes the most sought after free agent in the NBA writing and podcasting space. He also could be in play for NBC and Amazon, as they both get set to be new national broadcast partners of the NBA in 2025-26. As for ESPN, they are now tasked with not only reshaping their NBA coverage on the TV side, still needing to figure out their lead booth and the potential domino effect that will have on their other game broadcasts, but also their written coverage with Lowe and Woj both gone.

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge — and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Title: Why moves by Amazon and comments by Jamie Dimon don’t threaten an end to remote work benefits | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn’t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Or that Dell in a memo asked its global sales team employees who are able to work from a company office to do so five days a week, up from three previously, and noting that “working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine.” Or when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week — which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit. Or even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren’t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as “empty,” according to various news reports. Whenever big players publicly change direction and require employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit. But for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don’t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits. In the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy’s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture. But, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more “layers,” including “a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,” he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” Related article How can you prevent being laid off? You can’t. Here’s why Normally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is “not the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,” the company told CNN, noting that it has “no plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.” But by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, “middle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say ‘I’m leaving,’” said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives. That saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily. Jassy’s risk is that too many managers could quit. “He will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,” Williams said. If so, that may require Amazon to eventually — and quietly — back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested. While an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that’s not happening widely. Workplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022. As of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that’s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director. Related article Deciding what to do when your employer changes the rules on remote work A Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent. So it’s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.” Many CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time. Williams noted: “I have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.” Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

Title: Things are looking up for the economy. So why are consumers still unhappy?

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Gen Z are ‘conscious unbossing’—they’re avoiding stressful middle management roles

Tech giants have spent the last two years culling their middle managers. Amazon was the latest to send theirs to the chopping block just last week. Now, Gen Zers don’t even want to climb the greasy pole. In fact, 72% of the youngest generation of workers say they’d rather progress in an individual contributor role than become middle managers, according to the recruitment firm Robert Walters. Although just 16% of the 3,600 Gen Zers surveyed said that they will avoid middle management at all cost, it’s clear that the majority of young people today aren’t keen on the idea of managing others. Over half of Gen Zers expressed that they don’t want to be middle managers, as part of a trend that has been dubbed ‘conscious unbossing.’ Even the 36% of respondents who said they do anticipate stepping into a managerial position at some point in their careers, admitted they don’t actually want to. It’s not that Gen Z workers don’t want success—they’d just rather it didn’t come with the responsibility of managing others. Lucy Bisset, a director at Robert Walters, said that Gen Z prefers to bring their “whole self to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.” A clear example of this is the rise in young people ditching the corporate rat race to become their own boss—or an influencer. According to LinkedIn, the second fastest-growing job title among Gen Z grads right now is “founder.” Read more from Fortune –Sam Altman says it’s relentless and all-consuming to run OpenAI teams after shock CTO departure –YouTube’s MrBeast looks for ‘obsessed’ employees to help run his $700 million company, per leaked handbook –Here’s what actually makes employees happy and more likely to stay at their jobs –Laurene Powell Jobs is one of Kamala Harris’s biggest bankrollers—and closest friends –‘As painful as disruption is, it’s not negotiable’ says CarMax’s CEO Meanwhile, separate data shows that more than half of Gen Z say they would become full-time influencers if they had the opportunity, and the percentage has only gone up in surveys dating back to 2019. “My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore,” Steven Schwartz, the Gen Z founder and CEO of the multimillion-dollar marketplace Whop previously told Fortune. “They want to make content online, they want to find customers online… Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?” Really, it’s hard to know whether Gen Zers would actually turn down management roles. With the oldest of the generation turning 27 this year, many won’t have been offered the opportunity to step up yet—but it’s hardly surprising they’ve been put off. Having joined the world of work during tech company’s quest for “efficiency,” Gen Z has repeatedly been sent the message that middle managers are disposable. At Google, where 12,000 managers lost their jobs last year, workers have been told it will be harder to get promoted into management roles going forward. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said that “flattening” its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure last year. He credited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having “fewer layers of management.” In fact, middle-management positions accounted for almost one-third of layoffs in 2023, Bloomberg found, up from 20% in 2018—and the “great unbossing” trend hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15%” (by cutting the number of managers at the tech giant). What’s more, even middle managers who haven’t been laid off are opting to walk out of the role. Earlier this year, a global study found that 75% of millennial managers feel overwhelmed, stressed, and burnt out. As a result, many are eyeing the exit and looking for non-management gigs. Is it any wonder that when Robert Waters asked young people why they’re turning their noses up at middle management jobs, nearly 70% responded: “Too high stress, low reward.” “Those new to middle management experience a steep step-up in workload, further expectations to be ‘always available’ to those they manage, as well continuing pressure to hit their own targets,” Bisset explained. “It’s clear how these roles can prove overwhelming and deter many from taking on the extra responsibility.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

We are now in the -ber months, which means Christmas is right around the corner.

The Razer wireless charger uses a magnetic contact system that lets you easily mount the controller without worrying about interrupting the charge, as the magnets keep it securely in place. Once you've connected your controller, it should fully charge in under three hours. The stand features overcharge protection to prevent overheating or short-circuiting. Regarding compatibility, Razer says that its charger works with all Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Elite Series 1 Wireless Controllers, so it should work with whatever controllers you have at home. If for whatever reason it doesn't work, then know that it comes with a 30-day refund/replacement guarantee from Amazon if you want to send it back.

Title: Future of TV Briefing: How publishers are turning podcasts into video talk shows

More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at how Overtime and Vox Media are adapting their podcasts into long-form videos. Honestly, I thought video podcasts were just a fad. And obviously, I was wrong. Way wrong. More than 170 million people have watched a video podcast on Spotify, per the company, and YouTube has become the “most used” platform for consuming podcasts, according to a study by Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights. All of which is to say: Podcasts are becoming largely video productions. As a result, podcast publishers are having to sort out how to adapt podcasts into videos. Sure, they can just hook up a show’s RSS feed to YouTube and have the audio play over a static image of the podcast’s thumbnail image. But then that’s not really a video podcast. “There is a version of a video show that you could do, say, on YouTube that is a static image and just a long-form audio bed underneath it. That doesn’t feel as native to the platform, even though people do consume that way. And so as we think about podcasts as like a modern talk show – our chat podcasts at least – we are thinking about what’s native to the different platforms where they appear,” said Nishat Kurwa, svp and executive producer for podcasts at Vox Media, which has been producing video podcasts since The Verge’s Vergecast debuted in November 2011. Making video podcasts native to platforms like YouTube means making sure a video podcast is as much a video as a podcast. There are some basic elements, like filming the hosts and guests. But simply recording a Zoom session or setting up a single camera in a podcast studio doesn’t necessarily suffice. “It’s important for us to be cutting and changing the layout of the screen, just to keep the user engaged. That’s one thing that you never need to think about for audio, vs. on video, it’s like, ‘How is there some type of change every once in a while so that people are not just looking at the same type of image for too long?’” said Sam Gordon, editor-in-chief of Overtime, which started producing long-form video podcasts roughly six months ago and has accumulated 55 million views on YouTube for those podcasts in the past two months. Much of the answer to that question depends on how the podcast is recorded. If done entirely in person, then a best practice is to set up three cameras on set: one focused on the host, one focused on the guest(s) or cohost and one set at a wide angle to show all parties. “That way we always have two angles that we can pull from for any given person,” said Gordon. In-person recordings also open up production design opportunities to create visual interest on the set. For example, Sue Bird’s and Megan Rapinoe’s podcast with Vox Media, “A Touch More,” originated as an Instagram Live series recorded at home. So the video podcast is filmed in one of Vox Media’s studios on a set “that looks like a cozy room,” said Kurwa. If recorded remotely via Zoom or another video conferencing platform, creating visual interest can be trickier. Webcam-quality clips are often of lower resolution than what people are accustomed to watching on YouTube, especially as more of YouTube’s watch time takes place on TV screens. This is where graphics become the unsung workhorse of the video podcast. “You can add a lot of personality with graphics,” said Kurwa. Overtime, for example, has graphics packages for each of its shows recorded via Zoom. These graphics enable the Zoom recordings to be inset as opposed to scaled up to cover the entire screen and enlarge the lower image quality. Additionally, Overtime sometimes adds motion to the graphics that add depth and life to the shot. “We also have graphics where we can show multiple camera angles at once. If you go full screen, and it’s half one [clip] and half the other, it’s not visually engaging,” Gordon said. Vox Media similarly enlists its design team to create custom visuals and motion graphics for its video podcasts. “We map out what the segments are going to be in the show. We talk to the design team about some recurring templates that we think we’re going to use, whether that’s the segment title cards or recurring motion graphics that we think will be useful to have over time,” Kurwa said. Minding the visual as well as aural quality of podcasts is also reshaping the skillsets of those working on podcasts. Case in point: Production assistants on the Vox Media Podcast Network’s production team have historically been responsible for pulling archival audio clips and now are being asked to also pull b-roll video clips. “We are seeing the future of podcasts as multi-platform shows. I think that is a skillset that’s really beneficial for podcast producers to have, so that they can be more versatile in the jobs of now, the jobs of the future, and be more of an asset to more kinds of productions,” Kurwa said. “It’s: Speak out, but don’t speak out if you want to pay your rent, but speak out if you want to be a morally accepted creator, but don’t speak out if you want to be able to pay your bills.” Thanks to the Summer Olympics airing across traditional TV and streaming, people spent more time watching NBCUniversal properties on their TV screens in August than any other media company’s, according to Nielsen’s latest Media Distributor Gauge viewership report. NBCUniversal’s upswing didn’t necessarily come at a cost to all other companies’ watch time shares. YouTube and Roku’s The Roku Channel gained share in the month. 90%: Percentage share of Paramount Global’s planned layoffs that the company expects to have been completed after Tuesday. $100: Price of Roku’s new Ultra connected TV device.

Lionsgate’s AI deal: The movie and TV studio has signed a deal with generative AI company Runway that gives the latter access to its content library and the former access to an AI model trained on that content, seemingly without any money changing hands between the two, according to The Wall Street Journal. YouTube’s AI tools: A year after unveiling generative AI tools for creators, YouTube is adding to its lineup by formally rolling out products to let creators have generative AI come up with video concepts and even create actual videos (albeit only up to 6-second-long clips), according to The Verge. Amazon’s AI ads: Like Google and Meta before it, Amazon has created a tool for advertisers to have AI create their video ads by converting static images into video, according to TechCrunch.
