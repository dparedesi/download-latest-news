Shaffan Mustafa was laid off for the first time in 2020. Four years later, in January 2024, the software engineer in Ohio was laid off again. Then, in September, he was let go from a contract job. "I wish I could say I didn't have experience with layoffs, but unfortunately, I have a bit too much," he tells me. The first time, he found it depressing. It took him 10 months of scouring job boards and hundreds of unanswered applications before he landed his next role at a local consulting company. The second time, says the 29-year-old, "I was still sad about it, but at that point it wasn't as unexpected." His third layoff in five years has been different. In the middle of yet another job search a few months ago, he came across a Substack called Laid Off. "I probably typed something like 'being laid off sucks' and found it that way," he says. After reading several people's layoff stories on the Substack, he felt less alone. He became a paid subscriber and joined the dedicated Discord group where members went into more detail about their layoffs, shared job updates, and ranted about the state of the economy. Mustafa checks the group daily, sometimes every few hours. The Substack is the brainchild of Melanie Ehrenkranz. After being laid off herself from her role as a newsletter editor at a financial technology startup in 2023, she wanted a way to process the experience. "I felt like there wasn't really a lot of spotlight on the individual experience of a layoff outside of a LinkedIn post or a tweet or a group chat with a couple of your friends," she says. Ehrenkranz, 35, found a job nine months after being laid off, but she decided to launch the newsletter anyway. In August 2024, she shared her first post, an interview with a social media producer laid off from Condé Nast, asking her questions such as, "Where were you when you found out?" and "What was your greatest financial concern with the sudden loss of income?" and "Has being laid off changed how you view your relationship to work?" She has since been inundated with people willing to share their stories. Within two months, Laid Off grew to 5,000 subscribers. Recently, it surpassed 10,000. The number of Americans facing long-term unemployment has crept up from 1.05 million in February 2023 to over 1.67 million as of last month. Since 2022, more than half a million tech workers have been laid off — one analysis found there had been about 90,000 tech layoffs in the first five months of 2025. Amid the job losses, a new culture around layoffs has sprung up. Workers are livestreaming their layoffs to audiences of millions on TikTok. The post-layoff note on LinkedIn has become so ubiquitous that it's now a social media cliché. Many of the newly laid-off have no qualms declaring themselves #OpenToWork. There's even layoff merch now. To welcome the legions of freshly unemployed, a network of layoff support groups has emerged. On Reddit, r/Layoffs is in the top 2% of subreddits by size, with more than 120,000 members. On LinkedIn, there are more than 100 groups for those affected by layoffs, including company-specific groups for Meta, X, and Amazon. Across social platforms, layoff influencers are attracting thousands of followers by sharing advice and commiserating with those in the same boat. While workers can't change the fact of being laid off, they are no longer taking it lying down. In the 1990s, layoffs had become more or less standard business practice, but there was still a major taboo around them. "We've all heard those stories about a dad who was laid off," says Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. "Every day, instead of going to work, he goes to the mall and spends eight hours there before coming home. He's embarrassed to not be working." Then the pandemic changed layoff culture. More than a fifth of the American workforce was laid off during the first few months of COVID-19, a decline in employment not seen since the end of World War II. Layoffs stopped being seen as an individual failing but as an unfortunate byproduct of economic instability. People stuck at home on their laptops all day began broadcasting their unemployed status. LinkedIn introduced its green #OpenToWork banner in June 2020. The post-layoff note, with its cheery tone and calls to "reach out if you're hiring," quickly became standard practice. As more layoffs have hit in the past year, the stigma has vanished even more. "It used to be if you got laid off, it's because you're a screwup — you're just a bad employee," Mustafa says. "Now it's just par for the course." For some, being laid off became not just a LinkedIn update but lucrative content. Giovanna Ventola, a commercial real estate worker, first went viral for sharing advice to other job seekers after being laid off three times in three years, Bloomberg reported. She has gained nearly 30,000 followers sharing her perspective on coping with unemployment and has launched a professional networking platform, Rhize. Others have documented their days-in-the-life navigating being newly unemployed. In her newsletter, Ehrenkranz has spotlighted stories from everyone from a design intern for the National Park Service to a creative director at Google. "I definitely think it's opening up people's eyes to the fact that a layoff is not this thing that happens to a certain type of person in a certain industry," Ehrenkranz says. "It's something that can happen to anyone." The new visibility of layoffs doesn't make it any easier when a call with HR gets added to your calendar. Research published in the International Journal of Mental Health found that losing a job increased the risk of depression, risky substance use, and suicide. For Mustafa, being laid off meant involuntarily grinding his teeth at night and having debilitating stress headaches. Christine Reichenbach was laid off from her chief of staff role at the cloud computing company VMware in January 2024 while she was 34 weeks pregnant. It quickly sent her into a downward spiral. She ended up on postpartum anxiety medication and, despite having ample savings, put her baby in day care at seven weeks to frantically hunt for a new job. "It was very illogical," she says. "It's just what it did to my brain." At the time, Reichenbach was introduced to a Discord group called The Labor Club, a referral-only application-based group of 500 women who have experienced being laid off while pregnant or postpartum. "It's a specific niche that was just awful to experience," Reichenbach says. Her husband, though supportive, couldn't relate to what she was going through. "He has no idea what it's like to be laid off pregnant." Instead, she had a pool of women to turn to for both practical resources and, importantly, emotional support. After some soul-searching, Reichenbach decided to leave Big Tech altogether and founded her own company, The Phoenix Formula, at the start of this year with the goal of empowering other job seekers. She is also building her own support group, Beyond the Layoffs, on LinkedIn and Slack. "People need a space for this to actually be constructive," she says. If members need a space to yell in all caps, there's a channel for that. "I hope it's a place people can vent on a bad day and it's not on social media for hiring managers to see," she says. As the stigma around layoffs disappears, the boundaries of professionalism on social media have become increasingly blurred. Ask any recruiter, and they'll say bad-mouthing a previous employer on social media is tantamount to career cyanide. "It gives me alarm bells," says Brad Thomas, a business manager at Orange Quarter, a tech recruitment company in New York. "It's the same as when a candidate interviews somewhere — talking bad in an unprofessional manner about a previous employer is just not a good look." His advice when it comes to posting on social media is to keep it professional. In the new culture of layoffs, however, there is an important caveat. "The size of the company makes a difference," Thomas explains. "If someone has a pop at Meta or Google, it's less personal and less damaging to the brand versus a startup of 30 people." Earlier this year, when Meta let go of some 4,000 workers, branding them as "low performers" on the way out, the departing employees refused to leave quietly, pushing back on the label on LinkedIn. As Business Insider's Aki Ito wrote, "This is something we haven't seen before in the professional world: Employees sticking up for themselves in public, and calling out their former employer for misrepresenting their work." Both the social media posts and the private communities offer a kind of testimony that shifts blame from the employee back onto the employer. Ehrenkranz has had many people tell her that being interviewed for Laid Off or filling out her surveys is a cathartic experience. "A layoff these days is a 10-minute Zoom call, shut your computer, and then you're thrown into this new chapter," she says. Having a dedicated space to talk about being laid off with those who get it is a relief for Mustafa. "I don't really feel like I'm being pushy or shoving my layoff experiences down someone's throat," he says. While there is power in numbers, for some, those numbers can be overwhelming. A friend of Mustafa's left the Discord group shortly after joining. "She was getting emotionally burned out from hearing about layoffs," he explains. "She's fortunately a freelance writer, so she's making some money. She can just tune out that stuff if she wants to. For me, I'm still desperately tuned in." Ehrenkranz focuses on making sure the Laid Off community is a toxic-positivity-free zone. "I would say the vibe is just real," she says. "There's no 'Everything happens for a reason' or 'You'll get the next one.' People don't want to hear that." Rather than just a place to wallow, many of these support groups are designed as both a safety net and a springboard for when members are ready to begin the hunt for their next role. Fana Yohannes, a social media consultant and former Meta employee, founded the group Here2Help to give job seekers a leg up. In the wake of the 2020 layoffs, she posted on Instagram that she was open to reviewing and providing feedback on five people's résumés. "One person replied and was like, actually, I'd be down to help too," she says. From there, Yohannes says, Here2Help grew to 200 mentors who helped about 2,000 people find new opportunities during COVID. "We've come to an era where layoffs are part of the job," Yohannes says. "We have to kind of be strategic." After four months of sending out applications, Mustafa has a second interview lined up for another tech role. Even if he gets the job, he plans on staying in the Laid Off community for a while — just in case. "I can't trust these people anymore," he says about employers.

Title: AI Is Taking Thousands Of Jobs; Is Yours At Risk?

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/08/2025 7:48:31 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Just as the internet radically changed how America conducts business, artificial intelligence (AI) is also making waves in the workplace by taking thousands of jobs. It’s an outcome that industry experts have warned would happen, and professionals across multiple employment sectors have already been affected.Beyond artists and content creators, AI is also impacting professionals in marketing, technology, translation, various levels of administration, and management. It has been a silent and ongoing trend for two years, but tech insiders say this is just the beginning.A senior software engineer at Microsoft, Nandita Giri, shared her thoughts with The Epoch Times on what kind of near-term changes Americans can expect as a result of ramped-up workplace AI integration.“AI is particularly effective at replacing routine, predictable tasks ... jobs in data entry, customer support, transcription, and logistics are the most vulnerable,” Giri said. “In software engineering, even some junior [developer] testing roles are being replaced or reshaped with AI-driven tooling. Back-office operations across health care, finance, and legal are also at high risk.”Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Beyond artists and content creators, AI is also impacting professionals in marketing, technology, translation, various levels of administration, and management. It has been a silent and ongoing trend for two years, but tech insiders say this is just the beginning.A senior software engineer at Microsoft, Nandita Giri, shared her thoughts with The Epoch Times on what kind of near-term changes Americans can expect as a result of ramped-up workplace AI integration.“AI is particularly effective at replacing routine, predictable tasks ... jobs in data entry, customer support, transcription, and logistics are the most vulnerable,” Giri said. “In software engineering, even some junior [developer] testing roles are being replaced or reshaped with AI-driven tooling. Back-office operations across health care, finance, and legal are also at high risk.”Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem.

The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Giri has observed a shift away from human workers in favor of AI in enterprise software development, where she said companies are quietly removing what they call “coordination overhead.” She said this is happening as AI tools become more reliable for things like task triage, scheduling, and summarization.“AI agents have enabled a single engineer to manage what used to be a multi-person workflow, especially in automation pipelines and internal support tasks,” she said.Restructuring WorkflowCahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Cahyo Subroto, founder of the AI-powered data extraction platform MrScraper, agrees with this perspective.“I’ve spent the last few years building systems that automate work, so I’ve seen firsthand where AI adds value and where it quietly pushes people out of the picture,” Subroto told The Epoch Times.Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Like Giri, Subroto said that the jobs most in danger of AI replacement are those that rely heavily on structured, repetitive digital labor.“That includes early-stage analysts, junior QA [quality assurance] testers, data entry staff, and even support roles in HR and customer service,” he said.Subroto explained that when AI can learn workflow patterns, it can perform them faster and without the payroll cost. “At my last company, I watched a client eliminate three QA positions after switching to a tool that could auto-generate test cases and report bugs in real time.”These decisions are based strictly on efficiency, he added. “That’s what makes this shift so difficult to stop.”In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a report that estimated 92 million jobs would be displaced by AI by 2030. The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

The think tank surveyed more than 1,000 of the world’s largest employers, accounting for 22 industry groups and more than 14 million workers.There is a silver lining, however. The WEF—and many others—predict that AI will also create new jobs and reshape existing positions, allowing current employees in various sectors to focus on more high-value tasks instead of routine work.A robot sprinkles cheese over a pizza at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, Germany, on March 8, 2017. Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Ingo Wagner/dpa/AFP via Getty ImagesJobs with declining demand include customer service representatives, claims adjusters, bank tellers, graphic designers, accountants, and auditors, the WEF report said.Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Subroto believes much of the shift toward AI will be subtle. “Instead of replacing people, we’re restructuring the workflow to rely on AI for the mechanical parts, while humans take on broader accountability.”“That’s a harder conversation because it’s not about job loss. It’s about job transformation, and not everyone will be equipped and ready to make that jump,” he said.Big Changes AheadIn May, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 3 percent of its employees across the board, affecting roughly 6,000 people. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the tech giant said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts weren’t related to worker performance.It’s reportedly the largest series of layoffs at Microsoft since 2023.This arrives on the heels of reported cuts at Amazon, which in January said it would lay off what it called a “small number” of its communications and sustainability employees. It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

It followed that by announcing in March plans to eliminate 14,000 managerial positions by early next year.Among those who lost their job at Microsoft is former senior data scientist Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem. She told The Epoch Times that increased tech layoffs alongside the rise of AI integration is an industry red flag.“This has sparked genuine concerns over the future need for human programmers and signals a real, accelerating shift in how companies evaluate which human roles are essential,” Teppoeva said.Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Like Giri and Subroto, Teppoeva identified industries that have a lot of unchanging, rules-based tasks like back-end software development, data entry, finance, and logistics as areas with a high probability of AI job replacement.“The most realistic near-term disruption is task-level automation, not full job replacement,” she said. “For example, in sales, AI tools can draft outreach emails or analyze deal data, but they cannot replicate the human-to-human trust, nonverbal signals, and presence that close high-ticket deals.”Teppoeva said the human-AI gap is now a point of focus for her business. “Helping sales teams, executives, and companies align their human communication, body language, voice, [and] nonverbal presence [is] what advanced AI tools still can’t do,” she said, then added, “At least not yet.”On June 2, a Midwest-based web content manager for a major U.S. company—who asked to be identified only as “Tom”—was laid off with the rest of his department and most of the company’s marketing staff. Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Tom requested the company not be identified out of fear it could affect his severance.Having worked in web development for more than 15 years, Tom said he saw the “AI blitz” coming and had a gut hunch it would only be a matter of time before he was made redundant.“The worst part is the lack of honesty,” Tom said. “Companies aren’t being straight with people, they’re just saying things like ’sales are down‘ or ’we need to improve efficiency,' but the reality is it’s about increasing profit by any means.”Tom said he has a friend who spent nearly two decades working in marketing and kept up with changing industry trends before being laid off a year ago because of AI integration.“There are entire careers with university degrees behind them that are ending now,” Tom said.“It’s not necessarily a one-to-one ratio,” he added. “Maybe an AI tool automates half of a department’s workload. That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

That means you can redistribute the remaining work amongst a smaller team.”Since the Hollywood writers’ strike in 2023, the potential for AI to disrupt careers has been under a microscope, and it’s easy to see why. Out of more than 80,000 jobs cut in May 2023, nearly 4,000 were due to AI, according to a layoffs report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.The trend continued last year. In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

In 2024, the Society of Authors surveyed 12,500 workers in different creative industries, revealing many had already lost work to AI. According to the survey, 26 percent of illustrators and 36 percent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI.Tesla co-founder Elon Musk also shared his views on AI job replacement during the Viva Technology conference in Paris in 2024, following news that Tesla planned to lay off 10 percent of its workforce.A 3D-printed miniature model of Elon Musk and the Tesla logo are seen in this image from Jan. 23, 2025. Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters“If the computer and robot can do everything better than you, what meaning does your life have? ... In a negative scenario ... we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.Other tech insiders share this point of view. During an episode of “The Artificial Intelligence” show, Marketing AI Institute founder Paul Roetzer said AI is fundamentally reshaping the human workforce.“It’s not like we’re drawing some difficult-to-find conclusion here,” Roetzer said when discussing Microsoft’s most recent layoffs. “If the CTO [chief technology officer] of the company is saying that within five years we expect 95 percent of all code to be written by AI, then what do you need a bunch of engineers for?”Subroto used an example from his work, describing the use of AI for “task sequencing and code generation,” which allowed his company to launch features faster and fix bugs before users even saw them. However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

However, he said the improved work efficiency came at the cost of no longer needing manual testers checking outputs line by line.“These were smart, capable people, and yet the structure of the work changed so much that their role no longer made sense,” he said.The current phase-out of human work roles due to increased AI efficiency is nuanced, but some don’t think it will stay that way for much longer.A McKinsey Global Institute analysis from July 2023 predicted that 30 percent of total hours worked could be absorbed by generative AI by 2030. Researchers estimated that 11.8 million employees working in sectors with shrinking demand may need to shift into other departments, while roughly 9 million may need to change careers entirely.

Title: FIR against HDFC Bank MD-CEO by loan defaulter

TikTok’s parent company, has been replacing US-hired staff near Seattle with managers connected to China, aiming to replicate its e-commerce success in Asia after sales fell short in America. TikTok Shop initially set a goal to increase its US e-commerce business tenfold last year to $17.5 billion in transaction volume, but had to drastically lower that objective, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. TikTok established its Shop business in the Seattle area near Amazon.com Inc., the online retail giant it was aiming to displace. Meetings that used to be held in English are now often conducted in Mandarin and managers increasingly write in Chinese when communicating on Feishu, ByteDance’s internal Slack-like app, with English-speaking staff forced to rely on the built-in translation function. “We continually assess our business needs and have made recent team adjustments to strengthen our organization, remaining confident in the future ahead,” a TikTok Shop spokesperson said. The company previously called the reported e-commerce transaction target “inaccurate.” More than 100 TikTok Shop employees in the US have been fired or have left amid confusion between leaders that has worsened the work environment, according to people familiar with the company. The cultural transition taking place in the firm coincides with its fight for survival in the US — due mainly to the app’s Chinese ties. A national security law passed by Congress last year requires TikTok’s US business to be spun off from its Chinese parent company or it will face a ban. Lawmakers warned that TikTok’s ties to China pose a threat to the safety and security of American users. President Donald Trump has twice delayed the ban — with legal assurances from his attorney general — and another deadline for divestiture looms later this month, though that might also be extended, the Wall Street Journal reported. ByteDance said during the Biden administration that it had no plan to sell TikTok, but in April the Beijing-based company confirmed that it had been in discussions with the Trump government regarding a potential solution for TikTok US. It said any agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law. The TikTok Shop near Seattle in February began requiring workers to be in the office five days a week for eight hours a day, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg. The change is in contrast to some other major tech companies that still offer flexible work schedules, and has been particularly burdensome for employees who often join late-night calls with colleagues in Asia after they leave the office, according to former employees. US-based staff require human resources and manager pre-approval to work from home. The changes were introduced after Bob Kang, China-based global head of TikTok’s e-commerce division, visited the office in Bellevue, Washington, earlier this year and found there weren’t enough staff present on a work day, according to multiple people who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Assigning Chinese executives to run TikTok’s fastest-growing business may raise questions about its previous corporate promise to distance the US operation from China. After Trump initially tried to ban the app during his first term, the company announced a security plan dubbed “Project Texas” and vowed to wall off the app’s US data and operations from any Chinese oversight. TikTok Shop is the biggest source of revenue for the video-sharing app besides advertising, and it has become a major investment area for ByteDance. Adding full-scale commerce to its eye-catching content and popular influencers sets it apart from rivals like Instagram and YouTube. The company still aims to challenge Amazon in major markets. Recruited Aggressively To better compete, TikTok Shop recruited aggressively near Seattle over the past three years, targeting people with experience at Amazon, according to a review of Linkedin profiles and people who worked at both companies. In some corners of TikTok’s Bellevue office of about 1,000 employees, the workflow felt like a remix of previous Amazon teams, the people said. But since January, growing tension in the teams below Kang and Nico Le Bourgeois, who oversaw TikTok’s e-commerce operations in the US, became a distraction for staff who were often unsure about whose orders to follow, the people said. TikTok’s uncertain fate in the US also weighed on morale. The company carried out a round of layoffs in April. A second batch followed in May. In the first round, Le Bourgeois was demoted when Mu Qing, a Chinese executive from ByteDance’s e-commerce platform Douyin moved to the Seattle area to run TikTok Shop in the US. After the second bout, Mu sent an internal message saying Le Bourgeois was leaving to pursue other opportunities, according to a copy of the message seen by Bloomberg. Those cuts were intended to improve TikTok’s “efficiency,” according to former employees, though it wasn’t clear to staff what factors contributed to a worker’s efficiency rating. With these changes, ByteDance leaders are bringing in people who are familiar with what worked for the company in China, where Douyin, its TikTok clone for the Chinese market, has evolved into a $490 billion shopping phenomenon. In addition to Mu, who was the head of Douyin’s e-commerce, six other leaders with Chinese backgrounds were appointed in April, according to a different internal memo from Kang viewed by Bloomberg. Possible Ban One challenge is that habits of many American users trend toward passive TikTok scrolling as opposed to making purchases in the app. Some US sellers told Bloomberg that they have also been reluctant to invest in the platform, given the possible ban. The final tally for the US e-commerce business’s 2024 sales came in at around $9 billion, according to an estimate by Singapore-based consultancy Momentum Works. TikTok Shop’s US struggles haven’t halted the company’s global shopping ambitions. ByteDance in 2021 rolled out e-commerce services in countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and the UK. In Southeast Asia, it’s already the region’s biggest shopping platform after Shopee, according to Momentum Works. Last year, TikTok Shop opened in five countries in Europe, including Germany and Spain. The Europe expansion was delayed because the company first prioritized US growth, Bloomberg reported. This is a crucial month for TikTok in the US. The company will host merchants and creators in Los Angeles next week for a summit featuring some of the new leaders of the e-commerce unit. The current deadline for ByteDance to sell the TikTok’s US operation is June 19 and there have been several interested suitors. The company came close to a possible spin-off in April to a consortium of investors that included Oracle Corp., but the deal was scuttled in part because of Trump’s trade war with China. Meanwhile, the churn of e-commerce employment continues in the Seattle area. Current and former TikTok Shop employees told Bloomberg that they get hounded by recruiting messages from Temu, another Chinese e-commerce competitor.

Title: Top researchers leave Intel to build startup with 'the biggest, baddest CPU'

AheadComputing CEO and co-founder Debbie Marr spent more than three decades at Intel, helping lead development of several generations of microprocessor. But she said her latest ideas required her to start fresh: "What we want to do has to be done outside of Intel. We want to move fast, we want to take a run at RISC-V."Mike Rogoway/The Oregonian Together, the four founders of Beaverton startup AheadComputing spent nearly a century at Intel. They were among Intel’s top chip architects, working years in advance to develop new generations of microprocessors to power the computers of the future. Now they’re on their own, flying without a net, building a new class of microprocessor on an entirely different architecture from Intel’s. Founded a year ago, AheadComputing is trying to prove there’s a better way to design computer chips. “AheadComputing is doing the biggest, baddest CPU in the world,” said Debbie Marr, the company’s CEO. A CPU is a central processing unit, the brain inside a computer. Intel has dominated the CPU market for decades, selling processors based on an architecture the chipmaker owns, called x86. Today, the computing ecosystem is fragmenting as new standards emerge. That’s one of the reasons Intel is struggling, as computing mainstays like Apple and Google use rival architectures to design their own chips for PCs, smartphones and data centers. AheadComputing is betting on an open architecture called RISC-V — RISC stands for “reduced instruction set computer.” The idea is to craft a streamlined microprocessor that works more efficiently by doing fewer things, and doing them better than conventional processors. For AheadComputing’s founders and 80 employees, many of them also Intel alumni, it’s a major break from the kind of work they’ve been doing all their careers. They’ve left a company with more than 100,000 workers to start a business with fewer than 100. “Every person in this room,” Marr said, looking across a conference table at her colleagues, “we could have stayed at Intel. We could have continued to do very exciting things at Intel.” They decided they had a better chance at leading a revolution in semiconductor technology at a startup than at a big, established company like Intel. And AheadComputing could be at the forefront of renewal in Oregon’s semiconductor ecosystem. “We see this opportunity, this light,” Marr said. “We took our chances.” Big players lose clout Intel has been operating in Oregon since the 1970s and has long been Oregon’s largest corporate employer. It has more than 20,000 employees in Washington County, including some of the world’s top semiconductor researchers. Very rarely, though, have any of those thousands of workers left to start their own chip business. That’s partly because it’s prohibitively expensive for a new company to build a semiconductor factory, and partly because Intel and other tech giants controlled the essential pieces around the CPU. It was hard for newcomers to break in. Today’s chip startups, however, don’t need their own factories. So-called fabless semiconductor designers like AheadComputing can outsource manufacturing to contractors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The graphics and AI chip designer Nvidia has become a $3 trillion company — the world’s most valuable business — doing exactly that. And AheadComputing cofounder Jonathan Pearce says the reign of the chip titans is fading as the systems that run computers break up into a series of “chiplets” from various companies, optimized for specific tasks. “You get the opportunity for a company like AheadComputing to provide that piece of the overall system,” Pearce said. “As opposed to the past 20 years where it was just one tech giant.” RISC-V, pronounced “Risk-five,” is especially inviting to startups because it’s an open technology, overseen by a consortium of tech firms. Unlike processors based on x86 or ARM designs, there’s no licensing fee to use RISC-V. AheadComputing maintains that open standards are the future for microprocessors, giving technology companies more opportunity to customize chip designs to suit their specific needs. It will be years before AheadComputing’s designs are on the market, but it envisions its chips will someday power PCs, laptops and data centers. Possible clients could include Google, Amazon, Samsung or other large computing companies. Members of AheadComputing's executive team. From left to right: Mark Dechene (co-founder), Alon Mahl (vice president), Jonathan Pearce (co-founder), Srikanth Srinivasan (co-founder), Debbie Marr (co-founder, CEO)Mike Rogoway/The Oregonian That vision, and the pedigree of the Intel alumni leading the Beaverton startup, has attracted a lot of attention within the industry. AheadComputing raised $22 million in venture capital in February. Prominent semiconductor engineer Jim Keller — a superstar in the rarified field of chip architecture, with stints at Intel, AMD and Apple — turned heads when he joined AheadComputing’s board a month later. The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation as new chips emerge for artificial intelligence and chipmakers test the laws of physics with radical innovations like quantum computing. “This is where the future is. It’s not about x86. It’s not traditional computer architecture. That’s pretty much a dead field,” said Christof Teuscher, a Portland State University professor who teaches microprocessor design and computer architecture. AheadComputing is arriving at the right moment, Teuscher said, positioning itself to capitalize on upheaval in the industry — and the ongoing exodus of Intel employees. At this point, though, he said no one can know which new chip architectures will prevail. Traditionally, Teuscher said RISC-V has been used for embedded systems and academic research. He said he’s skeptical that it can prevail as the industry moves toward high-performance designs for artificial intelligence and supercomputing. “There’s high risk, but potentially high payoff,” Teuscher said. “And that’s definitely what I would describe their approach.” Silicon Forest’s new growth At Intel, AheadComputing’s founders were accustomed to working with cutting-edge manufacturing tools and enormous research labs. Now they’re doing everything themselves — setting up their Wi-Fi network, adding memory to desktop computers and ordering snacks and coffee for the break room. Alon Mahl left Intel to be AheadComputing’s vice president of design verification, a key role ensuring the company’s chips work as expected. But one of his first tasks was to find and lease an office. He picked a spot on the top floor of The Round development near downtown Beaverton. “That’s what’s exciting, is that you’re not doing only one thing. You’re doing everything,” Mahl said. “And each one is doing whatever he can to make this company a success. So that’s why I feel energized.” Intel provided the energy and innovation that fueled several generations of new chip technologies. It spent tens of billions to stay ahead of rivals, growing into Oregon’s largest corporate employer with more than 20,000 workers in Washington County. The cutting edge became increasingly tenuous, though, as the features on computer chips approached the atomic scale. Intel suffered a series of manufacturing setbacks, the result of bad bets on production technology and an utter failure to break into new sectors, like smartphones and artificial intelligence. Intel’s stumbles risk destabilizing Oregon’s semiconductor industry, one of the state’s economic pillars. The company shed 3,000 jobs last year, and more layoffs are expected in the coming weeks. There’s no replacing the outsized impact of Intel’s factories. But new players could help keep Oregon in the game as the semiconductor industry evolves. Ampere Computing, founded by former Intel President Renée James, sold to Japanese investment bank SoftBank in March for $6.5 billion. It’s retaining its offices in Portland’s Pearl District, where it designs chips used in data centers. Other Intel alumni have started a handful of other Oregon chip businesses in recent months. AheadComputing says it has already outgrown its offices at The Round and is looking for more space somewhere in Washington County. Big companies are designed to meet many corporate needs, in the same way conventional CPUs are built to handle all computing workloads. AheadComputing wants to be more like its processors, moving faster because it’s dedicated to specific tasks. “It’s very hard to disrupt an industry from inside,” said Mark Dechene, who spent 16 years as an Intel CPU architect before co-founding AheadComputing. At Intel, he said, researchers would consistently underestimate how long a project would take. He said AheadComputing’s engineers guess wrong about the timeframe, too, but now it’s because they’re moving much more quickly than they anticipated. “With a small, focused team of very capable people,” Dechene said, “you can get stuff done incredibly fast.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Dozens of Amazon employees working on the retailer's book divisions have been laid off. As reported by Reuters, Amazon confirmed that it's cutting jobs across the Goodreads review site and Kindle units, which impacts fewer than 100 workers. Amazon says the recent layoffs across Goodreads and Kindle divisions are meant to improve efficiency and streamline operations. The giant retailer has constantly reduced staff across various divisions over the past few years. According to CEO Andy Jassy, reducing headcounts helps the company to eliminate bureaucracy. "As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently and to better align with our business roadmap, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles within the Books organization," an Amazon spokesperson said. Layoffs recently impacted employees in Amazon's Wondery podcast division, devices and services units, communications, and in-store staff. However, Amazon's Q1 results show the retailer has added about 4,000 jobs compared to Q4 2024. After the Covid pandemic settled down, many companies began laying off thousands of staff they hired during the pandemic to respond to growing demands. The layoff trend among tech firms still exists today, and AI has amplified it. The latest data shows that in 2025, about 62,832 tech employees were laid off across 141 tech companies. Also, 152,922 tech employees across 551 companies were laid off in 2024. More layoffs are expected to occur due to declining economic growth, tariffs, and the expansion of AI across companies. Amazon is also gearing up to double down in AI investments and robotics. The company has recently announced the forming of a new agentic AI team to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics. Also, a new report by The Information indicates that Amazon has begun testing humanoid robots for package delivery.

Title: PR Roundup: CEO Popularity, Wilson from Cast Away is Back, Mattel Studios

Remember Me By Nicole Schuman This week's PR Roundup looks at a new study from Morning Consult about CEO popularity and company reputation; Mattel going all in on entertainment with a new TV and film studio; and Wilson, the iconic volleyball, teaching the public about ecology and ocean waste. What happened: The American public’s relationship with CEOs is more complicated than ever. According to new data from Morning Consult, public sentiment toward top executives is sharply divided, with nearly equal numbers of U.S. adults saying they view CEOs favorably and unfavorably. The same split applies to trust: about half of respondents believe CEOs will do the right thing, while the other half aren't buying it. The findings come at a time when business leaders are increasingly stepping into the political spotlight. Consumers and employees alike are feeling the pressure and fatigue of ongoing economic uncertainty. The report also highlights how opinions about CEOs vary widely across age, income and political ideology lines, reinforcing the polarization seen in nearly every corner of public life. Key findings include: Communication takeaways: For comms pros, the message is clear: CEOs and the brands they lead must work even harder to build and keep trust. Ellyn Briggs, Brands Analyst at Morning Consult, says that the lists “underscore another important dimension of CEO public perception … oftentimes, opinions of an executive are closely tied to (or even interchangeable with) that of the company they work for.” “Case in point: Unlike Bezos or Elon Musk, Costco’s Vachris isn’t a household name or frequently making news,” she says. “And yet, because Costco is such a widely known and loved brand, he appeared as a favorite business leader for all U.S. adults and several other groups.” However, the study also notes that potential CEO-related risk increases with an increase in publicity. Briggs cites Tesla co-founder Musk in this case. “Since … Musk began inserting himself into divisive political and cultural conversations, several of the electric vehicle maker’s brand metrics, including favorability, purchase consideration and sales, have steeply declined,” she says. And if a CEO screws up once—take Martha Stewart, for example, and the insider trading debacle—companies can still recover. But when a CEO is constantly in the news for crises, that’s tough for any PR pro to overcome when it comes to consumer sentiment. What happened: The world’s most iconic volleyball, that you may remember from the movie “Cast Away,” is helping to tell the story of climate change. Ahead of the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference comes The Odyssey of Wilson, a powerful sustainability campaign that turns real UNESCO oceanographic data into an immersive, 450-year journey that sheds light on the devastating impact of plastic pollution on our oceans. Viewers of the campaign can follow Wilson’s imagined path through the world’s oceans as a metaphor for the long-term deterioration caused by plastics. The experience traces currents, tides and climate events to visualize the volleyball’s transformation into microplastics—witnessing acidification, ice shelf collapse and rising sea levels along the way. According to UNESCO, between 1.1 and 4.9 million tons of plastic are already present in the ocean. Communication Takeaways: Led by the Onda Azul Institute, with technological support from telecom giant Vivo, the campaign transforms complex, sobering data into a story that resonates emotionally and urges action. It’s a prime example of how to make difficult concepts—in this case, high level scientific data—accessible to the regular consumer. “This project is about making science human,” says André Luis Esteves, Executive Director at the Onda Azul Institute. “By following the journey of a simple object, we illustrate decades of invisible damage caused by plastic waste—and why it urgently needs global attention. We’ve transformed data into a story people can feel.” Africa Creative, known for bold storytelling and purpose-driven campaigns, led creative development for the campaign. The integrated effort includes an immersive digital platform to explore the journey, a short film, public installations in coastal cities and live activations during major sports broadcasts. “Science alone doesn’t move people—stories do,” says Raphael Vandystadt, VP of Sustainability at Africa Creative. “By turning complex data into a powerful visual journey, we help make the invisible visible. Communication plays a strategic role in mobilizing collective action for our oceans.” What happened: While the entertainment industry seems to be on a downswing as several companies, including Disney and NBCUniversal, announced layoffs this week, some brands are going all-in on entertainment content. Toymaker Mattel, the home of Barbie, announced it would combine its TV and film divisions this week to form a complete studio. As you may recall, the “Barbie” movie became a summer 2023 blockbuster smash, grossing more than $1.4 billion in worldwide box office sales. It also received nine Oscar nominations. According to Reuters, Mattel also plans future releases to include "Masters of the Universe," “a live-action film inspired by the He-Man action figures, and "Matchbox," based on its miniature cars,” as well as a possible Polly Pocket movie. Communication takeaways: Mattel’s announcement yesterday showcases a clear turn for brands. They are no longer just advertisers—they’re becoming their own entertainment companies. James DeJulio, CEO of Tongal, a longtime Mattel partner and award-winning creator platform, believes that in-house comms must operate like content studios to stay culturally relevant. “Mattel’s move … is just the latest signal that brands are no longer content to sit on the sidelines of storytelling,” DeJulio says. “It’s about owning the narrative. For communications teams, this marks a critical turning point. To stay competitive and culturally relevant, in-house comms functions must evolve into modern content engines—developing and distributing original content that extends brand messaging far beyond press releases and earned media. Podcasts, newsletters, social video and fan-first storytelling are no longer “nice-to-haves”—they’re the new baseline.” Nicole Schuman is Managing Editor at PRNEWS. Find a Job | Post a Job

Title: Why Microsoft has created its own print magazine

Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. Of all the many ways Microsoft could mark its 50th anniversary, I wasn’t expecting the software maker to launch a magazine. “It’s our answer to a timely question: How do we earn trust and hold attention in an age of scroll and skim? How do we create Signal in a world of noise?” asks Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer. Microsoft’s response to a world of people doomscrolling on X and TikTok is a print magazine that you can thumb through in peace and quiet. The first issue of Signal is 120 pages with a focus on AI, both as a topic and, to a small degree, a means of production. Microsoft hopes the magazine will bypass the digital world and reach business leaders directly every few months. “People are overloaded with information, and a lot of the information is pretty ephemeral,” says Steve Clayton, the executive editor of Signal, in an interview for Notepad. “[Signal is] partly a reaction to that, which is: how do we create something that’s more thoughtful and has some more permanence, and is a bit longer-lasting than a five-second TikTok video?” Signal looks like any high-quality magazine you’d find at a newsstand, complete with deep dives on Microsoft technologies, interviews with Microsoft executives, and some lighthearted quiz and trivia sections to round off the magazine format. It’s a magazine from Microsoft’s comms team, so don’t expect to read anything about Amazon or Google in here, or material that strays beyond a clean and tidy image of Microsoft. Instead, you’ve got guest appearances from CEO Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates in the premiere issue I’ve read. The deeper stories on Microsoft will look very familiar to anyone who has read Microsoft’s Source work, where the company writes its own stories about how its technology is being used throughout the world. These digital stories are a good reminder of how influential Microsoft is, but they’re not yarns that the company can easily pitch to journalists like me because they’re simply too self-promotional. Signal feels like a physical manifestation of Microsoft’s strategy with its Source stories. “Microsoft Source and Microsoft stories has been our opportunity to go direct,” says Clayton. Microsoft has printed 1,500 copies of Signal that it’s distributing at its own business-focused events. “Fifteen hundred is a good place to start, and the uptake has been really good. There’s been a lot of demand for it,” says Clayton. “If we get through those and see more demand that we can’t fulfill, then we’ll go and do another print run.” The publication schedule is still in flux as Microsoft gauges interest. “We’re starting to think about what the next few editions will be, and based on the reaction to this one, that will determine the size of the next print run,” says Clayton. Microsoft didn’t want to print 15,000 and have them sitting on shelves at its events, so it’s treading carefully for now with plans to publish every quarter or so. A big inspiration for Signal was the Costco magazine that’s distributed to millions of members every month, a reach that makes it one of the largest magazines in the country and a steady way for the retailer to reach its customers. “The facility, the team, and production that they’d set up, we have a lot of that capability already, so it was an opportunity for us to turn our attention to a new thing,” says Clayton. Costco mails out more than 15 million copies of its magazine with each issue, but Microsoft isn’t expecting to scale Signal to those heights yet. “I don’t think we’re going to go and compete with Costco’s magazine anytime soon, put it that way,” says Clayton. Signal, as you might expect, is very focused on how Microsoft’s technology is being used by businesses. That means it’s also very much focused on AI. I counted mentions on more than 50 of its 120 pages. There’s a story about a women’s soccer team in Spain that was recently promoted and grappled with the use of AI, a deep dive into how Vodafone is deploying AI, and another piece on how Microsoft’s research labs are using AI for science. There are also parts of Signal that look more clearly like promotional material for companies using Microsoft technology, or the types of customer stories that wouldn’t interest readers of The Verge. But there are also interesting, meatier stories. The Vodafone piece might sound like pure marketing, but I could see how it might be useful as a less technical guide for other CTOs thinking about rolling out AI. Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant helped build small parts of the first issue of Signal, but it’s unclear how deep that’ll go in story creation in future issues. “We certainly didn’t go in intentionally and say that we’re going to have an AI-generated story,” says Clayton. “At the back of the magazine there’s a small quiz that’s generated by Copilot, so you could argue that piece is generated by AI.” Clayton also says he used the deep research functionality of Copilot to help develop Microsoft’s periodic table. “I definitely see us using AI to help us do some of the research and production, and I think we’re open to what we can do with AI in the magazine, but it’s not something that’s front and center,” he says. Microsoft has been working with the Slow Journalism Company in the UK to help produce Signal. “I’ve long been a fan of their work and they were a big help in writing some of the pieces as well, and we’ll continue to work with them,” says Clayton. “They have great writing and editorial talent, and also they just know how to produce a magazine.” Learning how to create a magazine has been a big part of Microsoft’s experiment with Signal. A magazine has to have lighter pieces of content, and it all needs to be arranged in a compelling way to keep readers engaged. There’s a fine art to keep people turning a page in a magazine that’s different from getting someone to click on an online piece. I’ve enjoyed reading Signal, especially the soccer piece and the 50-year anniversary stories. Like any magazine there are parts I could happily skip over, but the design, attention to detail, and stories here are surprising for Microsoft’s first issue. I’m very curious to see whether a trend back to print emerges across other tech companies, and how many hands Signal actually ends up in. I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

Title: American workers in peril: How 1 foreign government is engineering largest U.S. job loss ever

By Amanda Bartolotta June 5, 2025 It’s no secret that massive layoffs are currently devastating American workers. While industries across the spectrum are affected, from retail to manufacturing, the hardest-hit area is America’s tech sector, with companies from Amazon to Microsoft to Meta cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs – over 23,400 tech jobs cut in April alone. While automation and AI are conveniently blamed, hardcore reality comes into view when companies routinely cite “cost-cutting” and “corporate restructuring” – phrases that are often euphemisms for laying off American workers while hiring more foreign workers at lower wages. At the same time, the government of India is openly celebrating the launch of its latest scheme to supercharge the export of Indian workers to the U.S. and other “high-income economies.” Its goal is to facilitate the global mobility and employment of millions of migrant Indian workers directly at the expense of jobs for Americans. Not just immigration, but a global labor-export campaign Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! India’s “Global Access to Talent from India” initiative, or GATI, launched May 6, was personally championed by India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other officials who essentially describe it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redirect jobs, wages and even long-term industry trends away from Americans and into the pockets of India’s government, its outsourcing giants and their international partners. Calling this a “now or never” moment, India warns that the window of demographic advantage could close as competition mounts from African nations, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and Brazil, all vying for their own share of the global labor market. Referring to a November 2024 think-tank report by two India-based entities, which projects a “global labor gap” of 45-50 million jobs in high-income countries by 2030, GATI sees a huge opportunity to flood foreign markets with its mass population to enter the global workforce. The document outlines a goal of doubling or even tripling the annual outflow of Indian workers, aiming for a “potential stock” of millions of Indian migrant workers overseas. But the ambition doesn’t end there. India is positioning itself as a “geostrategic partner” for major economies, hoping to be recognized as the world’s “trusted migration partner” and rebranding its citizens as a global “talent brand.” GATI predicts this “talent gap” could expand dramatically over the next two decades. Behind this bold new push, India has developed a structured and aggressive multi-horizon strategy to unlock its overseas labor potential. Through a combination of diaspora influence, bilateral negotiations, demand-side positioning, skill alignment and financing mechanisms, India calls for a “whole-of-nation” effort to coordinate the mass movement of workers abroad, treating its citizens as a strategic export. At the same time, Jaishankar demands that destination countries eliminate their own protections and reshape their laws to accommodate this outflow. This is not about mutual benefit, but about using foreign labor markets to solve India’s unemployment and economic growth crises. Outbound movement, remittance inflow Thus, by its own admission, GATI has engineered a massive, state-backed campaign to export Indian labor on a scale never before seen. This isn’t just about creating new job opportunities for Indians, it’s about systematically opening foreign markets, expanding India’s labor supply and building a permanent ecosystem that channels workers – and wages – out of America and into India. According to a leader of one of the report’s contributors, the India-based Boston Consulting Group, India’s labor exports could grow to as many as 2.5 million workers per year. Reality check: This is not a workforce solution for the United States. Indian officials publicly celebrate the higher wages their workers earn overseas, calling it “transformative” for India’s economy, while U.S. companies line up to replace Americans with cheaper, more compliant foreign labor. The result is a hollowing out of America’s middle class, not a win-win for both countries. What’s unfolding in America is not an isolated series of layoffs, but rather a deliberate, top-down overhaul of the U.S. labor market, designed by Indian policymakers, embraced by corporate America and propelled by relentless lobbying for ever more visas. In fact, the GATI Foundation openly targets $300 billion in annual remittances, money siphoned from American paychecks and communities, to be spent and invested back in India. India’s leaders make no secret of their endgame to use public-private partnerships to streamline recruitment, training and job placement for Indian nationals, maximizing remittance flows and strengthening India’s economic influence abroad. These remittance inflows have become a critical pillar of India’s economic strategy, pumping billions back into the country every year. Through GATI, India now aggressively markets itself as the world’s “reliable labor supplier,” positioning outbound migration as a strategic national asset. Unfortunately, the true impact of all this is that every job handed to an Indian guest worker is one lost to an American family. Through the GATI Foundation’s deep network of corporate partners, India is lobbying for looser visa rules and making Indian worker preference the “new normal” in major U.S. industries. Meanwhile, American companies are increasingly outsourcing everything from recruitment to training directly to Indian partners, ensuring that foreign nationals fill key roles while qualified U.S. citizens are left behind. Thus, at its core, the GATI Foundation’s blueprint is not about helping Americans or remedying genuine labor shortages, but about exploiting loopholes in U.S. immigration policy and leveraging global labor narratives to cement India’s rise, at the direct expense of the American workforce. The real agenda behind ‘Global Talent Shortage’ The GATI Foundation was created to exploit what India calls a “demand-supply mismatch” in global labor markets. Citing projections that labor shortages in high-income countries could reach 250 million in 25 years, India pitches itself as the answer, if only Western nations open their doors to millions of Indian workers. The GATI Report frames this supposed crisis as an economic certainty, pushing the narrative that countries like the U.S. and Europe must ramp up labor migration or face disaster. But this narrative falls apart on closer inspection. These “shortage” projections ignore millions of Americans and Westerners who have been forced out of the workforce by layoffs, offshoring and corporate cost-cutting. The “labor gap” is little more than an accounting trick, counting open positions that employers refuse to fill at fair wages and normal working conditions. Instead of investing in local workers, companies push for visas to import cheaper labor. And India stands ready to supply it. The contradiction is glaring: GATI and its supporters claim automation and “Gen AI” are both eliminating jobs and creating labor shortages at the same time. It’s a manufactured crisis, a narrative designed to benefit global corporations and foreign governments, but not American families. In truth, India’s campaign isn’t about filling genuine labor gaps, but about lobbying for new visa categories, higher caps and direct government-to-government deals to force open “mature” markets like the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. The GATI Report itself concedes that in these countries, mass inflows are possible only if their governments change laws and visa policies – not because the market demands it, but because India’s lobby demands it. After all, if there truly were a dire worker shortage, existing visa programs would be flooded with qualified applicants and positions would fill quickly. Instead, India is manufacturing demand by lobbying for new pathways and is using its diplomatic muscle to export its unemployment crisis and the “remittance gold rush” that comes with it, into Western economies. As detailed in India’s own 2024 Employment Report, India’s job creation is not keeping pace with its exploding youth population. Far from being a demographic advantage, this so-called dividend is a growing liability, with millions of educated young Indians unable to find work at home. But Jaishankar and the rest of India’s leadership are not merely describing labor trends; they’re demanding permanent, government-backed pipelines to move Indian workers into foreign markets, shifting the costs and consequences onto the United States and its citizens. The so-called “global talent shortage” is not a fact of economics, but a tool of policy – propaganda crafted to dismantle labor protections, depress American wages and entrench the power of foreign governments and multinationals, all at the expense of the American worker. The skills mirage: India’s talent shortage cover-up India promotes its vast, English-speaking workforce as the solution to the so-called global talent shortage, marketing the GATI scheme as a direct pipeline of world-class professionals. In truth, GATI is engineered to move as many people abroad as possible, papering over the persistent problems of quality, skills and employability that continue to plague India’s workforce. Leaders like Jaishankar champion “skill development” and “global mobility,” but India’s own data reveals the reality: Fewer than half of Indian postgraduates are employable by international standards, according to India’s Skill Reports. This isn’t about quality; it’s about numbers. Thus, billions are funneled into crash courses, language bootcamps and certifications, not to build genuine expertise, but to create a façade of qualification, often after jobs have already been promised overseas. Even in crucial sectors like healthcare, where Jaishankar boasts India can “solve” Western shortages, the fact remains: India struggles to meet its own domestic needs. Skill reports and experts like Dr. Lekha Chakraborty confirm that Indian training programs consistently fail to prepare graduates for real-world demands, leaving millions underserved and resources misallocated. Yet, rather than closing the skill gaps at home, the focus is on exporting as many workers as possible, regardless of whether they actually meet international standards. The reality is, India isn’t overflowing with world-class professionals; it’s overflowing with people. Thus, the Indian government’s real objective is to wedge as many Indian nationals as possible into good-paying American jobs, often regardless of true qualification or the local impact. Meanwhile, capable American workers are left behind, not due to a lack of ability, but because U.S. policymakers and corporations have bought into India’s narrative and abandoned investment in the American workforce. The hidden cost of investing in India’s labor-supply strategy India has built a vast financial infrastructure to facilitate outbound migration, offering bridging loans, insurance and rotating funds, all subsidized by public and private grants. For employers, it’s cheaper to bring in Indian nationals than to invest in their own workforce. But the GATI strategy doesn’t stop at financing. India is demanding that host countries overhaul their own labor systems to accommodate and protect incoming foreign workers. Grievance mechanisms, legal mandates and resource centers lock in rights for migrants, while incentives including low-interest business loans and reskilling support are used to tilt hiring toward foreign workers. The hidden costs are staggering. American workers are not only undercut by lower-paid foreign labor, but are forced to compete with a workforce backed by another nation’s government and a web of corporate allies. Meanwhile, U.S. training standards and credential requirements are undermined, eroding the value of American education and experience. This isn’t a temporary fix. It is a permanent, self-reinforcing system, channeling billions of dollars in remittances to India and institutionalizing foreign-worker preference in advanced economies. The outcome is inevitable: falling wages, lost jobs and a steady erosion of America’s sovereignty over its own workforce. Every dollar invested in this supply strategy is a dollar stolen from the American economy. It’s time to demand a course correction, one that puts American skills, livelihoods and interests first. Hiring from India is like signing a contract riddled with hidden clauses; by the time the consequences are clear, the damage is done. The American workforce deserves better. Those jobs belong to American workers, not a foreign government’s export strategy. A blueprint for displacement: India’s cold, calculated framework India’s own analysis admits Indian certifications often aren’t recognized overseas due to mismatched skill requirements and quality standards – a clear sign that many of the workers being pushed abroad are not actually qualified for the jobs at hand. To get around these constraints, India’s plan is to “harmonize demand-centric skilling,” lobbying for international recognition of Indian credentials and pushing for government-backed loans to subsidize outbound migration. The goal isn’t to meet genuine needs, but to bypass local standards and flood foreign markets, regardless of the consequences for host countries. Every time a visa barrier is lowered or a new guest worker program is launched, it opens the door for India to embed even more of its surplus labor in Western economies. But the ambitions don’t stop with white-collar tech jobs. India’s leaders are playing a much longer and more aggressive game, openly targeting blue-collar visa categories like H-2A and H-2B, sectors that have long provided stability for American families and local communities. Their policy documents make this crystal clear: India’s strategy is to steadily lobby for the removal of visa caps, to institutionalize so-called “circular migration” so Indian workers can cycle through U.S. jobs indefinitely and to push for changes in immigration law that make Indian labor the default option for both high- and low-skill roles. This is not a temporary workforce solution; it’s a step-by-step plan to permanently transform the American labor market in ways that serve India’s interests while sidelining American workers at every level. America’s future: At a crossroads Bottom line: As American companies outsource everything from recruitment to onboarding to Indian partners, foreign nationals are funneled into critical roles across tech, healthcare, engineering and more, frequently at the direct expense of U.S. citizens. Accreditation standards are diluted. Worker protections are eroded. The playing field is tilted. India’s GATI initiative does not represent an invitation for partnership; it serves as a stark warning. As Indian leaders openly coordinate, lobby and strategize to gain a foothold in U.S. job markets, too many American officials remain silent or, worse, actively complicit. Every so-called “strategic migration partnership” and each new visa pipeline laid is another brick in the wall separating American families from their own economic future. The stakes could not be higher. This is not a tale of isolated layoffs or routine workforce shifts, but a deliberate, foreign-led transformation of the U.S. labor market. It is sold as progress but experienced as loss in every community facing layoffs, stagnant wages and vanishing careers. Each time an American worker is replaced by a lower-paid Indian “guest worker,” it marks another victory for India’s national agenda and another defeat for the American middle class. Unless action is taken, this pattern will only accelerate. American laws, corporations and policymakers risk becoming tools for India’s economic ascent while the American dream is steadily outsourced and rewritten. Americans must demand that their leaders defend their interests by rejecting foreign lobbying, putting an end to corporate collusion that enables mass visa fraud and restoring a workforce system that prioritizes American citizens in their own country. The choice is clear. Either the United States reclaims its labor market, its laws and its future, or the nation will continue down a path where its greatest export is its own prosperity. History will not be kind to those who allowed this nation to be given away. Now is the time to draw the line: America first, in every job, every industry, and every decision. Otherwise, America’s children will no longer compete with the “world” for the American dream – because that dream will belong to India. Editor’s note: This story is one of the most important currently facing Americans – yet outside of WND, it is almost entirely unreported. For years, WND has warned about the dangers of unchecked immigration and global labor schemes. Now, in real time, Americans are witnessing a foreign government making its final, strategic move to overtake their nation, one visa at a time. WND cannot win this battle alone.

Title:  A taxing situation

Time Published: 2025-06-05T10:00:00Z

Good morning, Quartz readers! Calling on a hire power. The ADP private jobs report showed growth that was below expectations, leading to President Donald Trump calling for an interest rate cut. Statistically suspicious. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reportedly had to rely on educated guesses for its inflation numbers because of Trump’s DOGE-related hiring freeze. Earnings show cents and sensibility. Dollar Tree is the latest company to send a signal that, amid increasing economic uncertainty, U.S. shoppers are hunting for bargains. Still saving it for later. Fidelity data from the first quarter shows 401(k) balances are falling amid market uncertainty, but Americans are continuing to invest in increasing numbers. Uncapped potential for Wells Fargo. The Fed just lifted the asset cap it imposed on the bank in 2018, giving the bank plenty of room to grow. North Carolina: The AI of the storm. Amazon continues to pump money into the state, announcing plans to invest $10 billion in AI infrastructure spending for its AWS data centers. Prompting a revenue stream. OpenAI has increased its paid user base by 50% in just three months — as three million users now pay for the company’s ChatGPT products. Got Ives on the prize. Tech analyst Dan Ives — and Wedbush Securities, where he is the managing director — have launched an ETF that tracks AI stocks. Tesla’s overseas EViction notice? The automaker had a rough May — with sales down significantly across Europe, including a 45% year-over-year decline in the U.K. The Trump family’s coin of silence. The president’s sons have denied any involvement in a Trump-branded crypto wallet launch. In 2023, Microsoft cut 10,000 employees. Alphabet followed with 12,000. Meta launched its “Year of Efficiency.” Industry analysts blamed over-hiring and AI disruption, but buried in corporate filings was another, less visible culprit: a delayed change to Section 174 of the U.S. tax code. Until 2022, companies could fully deduct their research and development costs — from engineer salaries to internal software tools — in the year they were incurred. That incentive shaped Silicon Valley, encouraging companies to build in the U.S. and invest heavily in product development. But a provision buried in the 2017 Trump tax law quietly rewrote those rules. To make the bill appear “deficit neutral” on paper, lawmakers delayed a change to Section 174: Beginning in 2022, firms would be required to amortize R&D costs over five or 15 years, dramatically altering the economics of in-house development. The shift, described by insiders as a “niche issue with broad impact,” didn’t trigger headlines. But it did trigger layoffs — and not just in Big Tech. From direct-to-consumer startups to crypto platforms, companies that once relied on immediate R&D deductions suddenly faced real tax bills on paper profits. Entire teams vanished. And an economy built on rapid, software-driven innovation saw its growth model undermined by a single accounting change. Congress is now weighing a bipartisan rollback. But for the more than 500,000 tech workers who were already laid off — and for a sector that once generated 20% of U.S. GDP — the damage may be more than fiscal. Quartz’s Catherine Baab has more on the tax tweak that has become a layoff accelerator. White House staple (and Tesla CEO) Elon Musk has launched a public campaign against the cornerstone of Trump’s second-term policy agenda — a “big, beautiful” tax bill — calling on Republicans to scrap the party’s domestic “megabill” and start over. In a string of posts on X, Musk has denounced the legislation as “a disgusting abomination” and warned it would “bankrupt America.” He urged followers to contact their representatives, accompanied by an image from “Kill Bill” and an all-caps directive: “KILL the BILL.” Republican lawmakers appear unmoved. One senior GOP aide told Quartz that the fact that Trump is staying the course indicates that the party will hold the line. Privately, some suggest Musk’s opposition has less to do with deficit concerns and more with the bill’s scrapping of EV subsidies that directly benefit Tesla. Democrats are leaning into the political absurdity. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday referred to the proposal by a new name: the “Well, We Are All Going to Die Act,” referencing GOP Sen. Joni Ernst’s recent defense of Medicaid cuts. But whether Musk’s crusade is rooted in fiscal hawkishness or strategic self-interest, his comments add yet another complication to a bill that Trump wants on his desk by July 4. Quartz’s Joseph Zeballos-Roig has more on Musk’s high-voltage opposition. ✈️ FAA says it isn’t considering removing a production cap on 737 MAX planes 🇺🇸 These are the states with the best — and worst — economies at the moment 😰 Jensen Huang’s biographer says the CEO is motivated by “fear and guilt” 💸 How stock-based pay became the ultimate workplace perk 🍅 Tomatoes, beef, and more are among this week’s recalled foods Our best wishes on a safe start to the day.

Title: The Great Quack Revival
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-rfk-jr-maha-quacks.html
Time Published: 2025-06-05T09:00:05Z
Full Content:
Six months into the second Trump administration, it has become clear that now is the time of con men. Scams and snake oil proliferate, as do the hucksters who promote them. Before Mike Huckabee became our ambassador to Israel, he advertised Relaxium, an herbal supplement whose makers falsely pledged it would help a restless nation sleep. Other supplement-makers see a champion in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who not only opposes vaccines but has said the Food and Drug Administration should free the nation from the “aggressive suppression” of dubious vitamins and herbal substances. Kennedy has even hired David Geier to conduct a study into the debunked link between autism and vaccines, though authorities once punished Geier for experimenting on autistic children in a basement laboratory. Like his late father, Mark, Geier believes the puberty blocker Lupron can treat autism and says vaccines caused the developmental condition. Neither claim is true, but in the greater Make America Healthy Again universe, facts can be inconvenient. Dubious supplements and false cures have always been part of the quack’s tool kit, but Kennedy and his ilk aren’t limiting themselves to the mere promotion of pseudoscience. They’re attacking scientific research at the same time. Funding cuts and layoffs are weakening major institutions like the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, which were established to monitor our food supply and medicines for safety. The administration has canceled research grants to universities, slowing the pace of innovation. Scientists searching for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, various cancers, and genetic diseases say their work is in jeopardy — if it can continue at all. The MAHA war on expertise leaves Americans ever more vulnerable to predators and scams, which in turn exacerbates a much older problem: The quack has too much power and prospers in times of inequality and mistrust. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found 86 percent of Americans felt confident in the work of the country’s scientists. That figure declined during the pandemic, and though it rebounded slightly by 2024, it remains lower than its pre-COVID levels. Behind the numbers are hucksters who prospered during the pandemic thanks in part to Donald Trump himself. Although the president’s first term oversaw the rapid development of COVID vaccines, Trump also told people to inject disinfectant to fight the virus. Grifters peddled ivermectin, a horse dewormer, along with an anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine, which is not an effective COVID treatment. Trump would later tout it at a press conference, leading to fatal consequences for at least one listener. Hydroxychloroquine sounds a lot like chloroquine, a non-pharmaceutical chemical sold to clean fish tanks. An Arizona couple had purchased the substance to treat their koi pond and decided to drink it after tuning in to Trump’s performance. The wife lived; her husband did not. Meanwhile, luminaries like the disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker sold colloidal silver as a COVID remedy. There is no evidence that colloidal silver can treat any physical ailment or that ivermectin has a use beyond the elimination of parasites. Yet people still take them, often to their own detriment. Scott Adams, the right-wing creator of “Dilbert,” recently admitted he had used ivermectin to treat his prostate cancer. It didn’t work, and Adams says he expects to die from the disease this summer. Amy Carlson, the QAnon-adjacent cult leader better known as Mother God, consumed so much colloidal silver that her skin had turned blue by the time she died. Both discovered what scientists and physicians already knew: Quackery may promise good health, but it can’t make good on its pledge. At best, it does nothing; at worst, it kills. Despite this, quacks endure, and so does the risk they pose to public health. If MAHA sweeps the scientific Establishment aside, history suggests a wild and dangerous era awaits. Quackery is at least as old as the United States itself. Frontier life promised all sorts of dangers, and early settlers brought bizarre therapeutics with them to stave off fever and premature death. Unscrupulous apothecaries and makers of nostrums, as quack medicines are sometimes known, discovered a lucrative new market that alarmed professionals with medical training. In The Toadstool Millionaires, historian James Harvey Young quotes one colonial physician who suggested a “licensing system” that would “remove the ‘Shoemakers, Weavers, and Almanack-Makers, with their virtuous Consorts, who have laid aside the proper Business of their Lives, to turn Quacks.’” But profit beckoned, and quacks proliferated for many decades to come, though they achieved no results worth mentioning. In the 18th century, the Connecticut physician Elisha Perkins devised a pair of “metallic tractors,” or rods, that could allegedly cure painful ailments like rheumatism and generated a brief international mania. The Connecticut Medical Society expelled Perkins for nostrum-making, but he persisted, convinced of his own genius. When yellow fever struck New York City in 1799, he went out to treat the sick with a mixture of “marine salt, vinegar, and water” until he inevitably fell ill, died, and was buried in a potter’s field near what is now Washington Square Park. During the Gilded Age, the growth of the newspaper industry, the rise of public advertising, and the construction of railroads coincided with radical social and economic inequality — a complex situation that nostrum-makers could and did exploit. In one extreme case, Henry T. Helmbold spread word of “buchu,” a plant native to southern Africa, along the length of the Union Pacific Railroad. The bold advertising strategy worked, and Helmbold became a wealthy eccentric who enjoyed ruling-class patronage for years. In New York, his “Temple of Pharmacy” boasted “sarcophagus soda fountains, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, monogrammed gas globes, marble floors with the doctor’s initials inlaid in brass, fountains for dispensing perfume, and canary birds tweeting in their cages,” Young wrote. Temple attendants in elaborate uniforms sold buchu to Boss Tweed and John Jacob Astor. The problem? Buchu didn’t work, and Helmbold was an alcoholic. The temple closed, the birds died, and then so did Helmbold, in 1892. Helmbold courted the rich while other quacks pursued the poor. In the years before Helmbold constructed his temple, the Philadelphia nostrum-maker William Swaim sold a “panacea” for use in a city almshouse. Though Swaim said the drug had cured a patient there, the Philadelphia Medical Society eventually concluded the opposite was true: The patient had died. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. observed in the 1840s that quacks, “in trumping up ‘Dispensaries,’ ‘Colleges of Health,’ and other advertising charitable clap-traps,” had used “the poor as decoy-ducks for the rich.” A façade of respectability allowed them to prey on the unsuspecting, however, and by 1906, Congress felt pressured to act. The Pure Food and Drug Act made it illegal to sell misbranded or adulterated food and drugs, and it helped establish the FDA, though quack medicines still appeared on market shelves. The skeptic researcher Joe Nickell wrote in 1998 that patent medicines like Dr. Worden’s Female Pills and Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills were sold by mail-order companies years after the act took effect, and he noted that the later rise of “alternative medicine” could threaten modern generations if left unchecked. Today’s quacks have learned to manipulate various regulatory loopholes to sell fake cures to the masses. Homeopathy is hardly more sophisticated than Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills, but consumers can still purchase bottles of such medicines at Whole Foods. Insurance companies will often cover chiropractic treatment, though the field was founded by a spiritualist who got the idea from a ghost. My brother and I used to giggle at “horny goat weed” in our local gas stations, but the side effects aren’t that funny; it can make the user puke or hallucinate. These days, you can buy it on Amazon. Wealthier consumers may prefer to shop from Goop, which sells a “gemstone heat-therapy map” for $1,049. A bro who tunes in to Joe Rogan may hear of wondrous nootropics like Alpha Brain, created by a Rogan friend; a 2024 lawsuit accused the maker of “deceptive” advertising. The FDA “can’t even require that supplements be effective before they are sold,” KFF Health News reported in February. Medical scams and nostrum-making are still popular — and profitable, too, even though they can be dangerous. In January, a Michigan child burned to death inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber where he had endured 36 futile treatments for ADHD and sleep apnea. Though the United States does not stand alone in its susceptibility to nostrums, its unfettered free market is a bonanza for hucksters. The FDA hasn’t approved the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for conditions like autism and ADHD, but clinics and med spas across the country advertise miraculous effects and remain largely unregulated, which frees them to maximize profits at the expense of consumers. Social media spreads dubious medical claims further than even Helmbold could dream. On Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, anyone can be a quack or work for one. So-called “alternative medicine” was a multibillion-dollar business in the U.S. before Trump ever took office. Now that he’s back in power, with Kennedy helming public health, we are poised for a new golden age of quackery. Trump is in some respects the quintessential president of the quack. He is a huckster in his own right, as former Trump University students may attest, and pseudoscience can prop up an authoritarian government. Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and the editor of Science-Based Medicine, has called the MAHA movement “the new Lysenkoism,” invoking a Soviet scientist who rose to prominence during Stalin’s regime. Trofim Lysenko repudiated Darwinism and the emerging field of genetics on ideological grounds, and his unfounded agricultural theories helped Stalin starve millions of people. We’re not there, but quackery still exacts a significant human toll. A nationwide measles outbreak has killed at least two children, but anti-vaccine parents and some doctors have attempted to treat the disease with cod-liver oil, though there’s no evidence that it works. Kennedy has nevertheless promoted the oil as a treatment for measles in his public statements. In May, Trump nominated Kennedy ally Casey Means to be surgeon general, though Means has questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and called researcher Dale Bredesen a “medical hero” — though Bredesen no longer practices medicine, he promotes a complicated diet and supplement regime that he claims can reverse symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Mostly, it’s expensive. People can pay $810 to join Apollo Health, Bredesen’s company, which matches them with a Bredesen-approved physician. The New York Times reported one Illinois couple spent $25,000 to treat Alzheimer’s the Bredesen way before concluding that the Bredesen protocol doesn’t work. Lawmakers thus face a difficult if urgent task, and so do the nation’s experts. Trump won’t be around forever, and he’s making sure pseudoscience will outlast him. The root of the problem isn’t necessarily public ignorance but exploitation. Right now, it’s a predator’s market, and that’s not a coincidence. Without robust public institutions and a health-care system that prioritizes care over profit, mistrust will fester. Americans will lead sicker and shorter lives, and the next pandemic may be even deadlier than COVID. Others will waste money on treatments that don’t work or sacrifice their children to scam artists. Fighting Trump means fighting MAHA and, with it, the quack and the huckster. Rebuilding the federal government and closing regulatory loopholes will cost nostrum-makers some cash, but it’s the only way to make America healthy at last.

Title: Amazon's Lab126 ventures into "Physical AI" with new robotics team
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/amazons-lab126-ventures-into-physical-ai-with-new-robotics-team/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T07:54:01Z
Full Content:
Amazon has announced that it’s forming a new agentic AI team within its secretive hardware research and development division, Lab126, to begin work on physical AI. Specifically, the company is looking to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics, which could start to impact blue-collar jobs, especially at its warehouses. Agentic AI is one of the latest developments in AI, superseding the previous generative AI that took off with the launch of ChatGPT. Agentic AI models are special because they can complete multi-step actions for the user to complete complex tasks. Thanks to all the visual and audio capabilities added to generative AI in previous years, these agentic models can perceive their environment, reason, plan, and act to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. If Amazon can successfully bring agentic AI to robots, they will finally be able to interact with the real world in a way they can’t today, as software running on a computer. Many people are concerned about AI’s impact on white-collar jobs right now, but when Amazon develops physical AI, it will also affect blue-collar manual work. The work is going to be carried out by Amazon’s R&D company, Lab126. It was set up over 20 years ago and has created many iconic Amazon devices, including the Kindle, Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Echo devices, and more. The biggest impact of physical AI developed by Lab126 will be on Amazon’s warehouses and logistics. The company said it wants to create robots that can perform tasks based on natural language instructions. As usual for a big tech company, Amazon claims that these robots will be assistants, but it’s difficult to see how they won’t reduce the need for people. Solely based on Amazon’s plans to automate work in its factories, customers will see an indirect impact from the move through faster deliveries and potentially lower costs. The decision by Amazon to focus on agentic AI in robots is pretty interesting because so far, we’ve mainly been hearing about agentic AI limited to computer applications, such as intelligent web browsers like Opera Neon. Amazon has a reputation for being an efficient company, particularly when it comes to the employment of warehouse workers who are known to have strict restroom breaks. Creating robots that can help speed up warehouse activities will further boost efficiency at the company and could potentially reduce its costs and improve safety. The beginning of work on physical AI is just the next evolution of AI that we could start to hear about in the coming months and years. As agentic AI gets better, companies will be looking to see what they can advance next and physical AI may be where they choose to go next; it certainly seems like this is what Amazon has settled on in this move. If Amazon’s physical AI doesn’t lead to mass layoffs of warehouse employees, it could drastically boost worker safety. Employees could potentially be less fatigued from moving around so much, which could lead to better concentration and fewer accidents. Right now, Amazon claims that these robots will only be assistants and not replacements. While Amazon will certainly be a leader in physical AI, given its massive wealth to throw at the problem, once the technology is available, it will likely be available for sale to other businesses to use, too. While it’s a notable development, it still sounds like Amazon is in the early stages of developing these physical AI systems, given that it has only just set up the team. We also don’t know what specific products Amazon is planning to build or the timelines for deployment. Ever since generative AI came onto the scene, there has been discussion of AI safety. With AI moving into the physical world, it will also bring up discussion about the safety concerns. Current measures are mainly concerned with AI software running on computers, not when it interacts physically with the world. Finally, and probably the biggest concern, what will these “assistants” do to people’s jobs? Companies will likely find themselves bringing in fewer new hires initially, but it could also displace people from their jobs. Source: CNBC

Title: AI Could Turn Democrats Into the New Welfare Class
URL: http://www.newgeography.com/content/008552-ai-could-turn-democrats-into-new-welfare-class
Time Published: 2025-06-05T00:28:38Z
Full Content:
The New York Times’s jeremiad last week about AI’s impact on entry-level jobs — particularly in tech — merely underscores trends that have been clear for well over a year. Silicon Valley firms have been slashing jobs despite record profits, and since 2022 California has actually shed positions in the information sector. An astonishing 82% of millennials fear AI will drive down their compensation. They have every reason to be concerned. This trend could create a political storm of massive proportions. In recent decades the Democratic Party has been able to compensate for its ebbing support among blue-collar workers by winning over college-trained professionals. Almost all college-educated professionals — excluding those in the military and airline pilots — lean overwhelmingly Democratic. College degrees, particularly graduate ones, are among the strongest indicators of a Leftist tilt, yet are becoming ever less salient in terms of garnering higher salaries. This base is under increased assault, as universities are forced to confront declining enrollments and ever less public approval. At the same time, the supply of entry-level graduate jobs at major firms such as Salesforce, Meta, Amazon and Lyft are dwindling due to the introduction of AI. Google, most notably, has recently laid off 12,000 workers — a number that is expected to grow to 30,000. The damage may be even greater at the grassroots level. Within months of AI’s emergence, freelance work in software declined markedly, along with pay. In a survey earlier this month, two-thirds of business leaders suggested that ChatGPT will lead to large layoffs of white-collar workers over the next five years. Already, new AI programmes are allowing software firms to do without lower-level programmers, particularly new hires. To be sure, Americans without college degrees are not immune to the effects of AI. But in the near term, it’s college professors, administrators, lawyers, accountants, and psychologists — largely Democratic-leaning professionals — who are increasingly in the crosshairs. Even Hollywood, a traditional Democratic stronghold, faces mounting threats: as entertainment becomes more digitised, layoffs have accelerated, and studios find it far easier to shift production to lower-cost regions such as Eastern Europe. Who wins here? It will be those professions that use AI to build things, such as drones, spaceships and robots. These firms are not as heavily concentrated in places like Silicon Valley, which has largely embraced software, social media and consumer services, leaving its once proud industrial heritage behind. This is a huge opportunity for Texas in particular, since the state has always been oriented towards tangible engineering. Texas may have missed the social media boom, but its industrial legacy has left it well placed to dominate the “deep tech” builder space. This field often requires reliable and affordable energy — something not easy to get in states such as California or New York. Beyond elite AI engineers, the other likely winners may be those in physical, hands-on jobs — mechanics or oil rig workers — that are much harder to automate. AI pioneer Rony Abovitz told me that the big winner in the coming years will be the “sophisticated, technically capable blue-collar worker”. Young people might be better off ignoring Joe Biden’s famous advice to “learn to code” and instead consider trade schools which teach practical, in-demand skills.
