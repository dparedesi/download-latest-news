There will be more opportunities and slightly improved affordability for buyers and sellers in many markets, but also a wide range of experiences depending on where they live and what they can afford. Based on these dynamics, in 2026 buyers and sellers can expect to see: “The 2026 housing market will be shaped by uncertainty—economic, demographic and regional,” said Lisa Sturtevant, Chief Economist at Bright MLS. “While lower mortgage rates and more inventory will bring some buyers back, this will be a reset year, not a rebound year. Market performance will hinge on local economic conditions, making 2026 one of the most geographically divided markets we’ve seen in years.” Key Trends and Wild Cards for 2026 While national averages provide a framework, local conditions and unexpected factors will shape consumer experiences in 2026.

By Jason Hopkins, Daily Caller News Foundation December 2, 2025 They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,’” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs.

Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

I also like your statement that, for national economy purposes (and I'd add for national security purposes), it'd be dangerous for us to tell future workers to not be our tech experts. Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 11 posted on 12/02/2025 8:51:53 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson ‘Disillusioned’ Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans.

About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. ‘We’re All In The Process Of Being Replaced’ India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

It did work out OK for me, but I got in decades ago and have now retired. They can offshore your job. They can bring foreigners here to take away your job. Your job can be automated. Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: ClearCase_guy The biggest problem with the IT field is that it has two characteristics that make it fertile ground for a "race to the bottom" type of business/employment environment: 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 12 posted on 12/02/2025 8:57:07 AM PST by Alberta's Child ("There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.")

In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program.

His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Your job can be eliminated by fools upstairs who don’t understand why technology is important. And technology changes all the time — it’s real work to stay up to speed, and if you don’t, they will bring in a new foreigner who just graduated with the latest skill and who will work cheap. It’s a pretty foolish career path at this point. But, from the view of a national economy of a developed nation — you REALLY want your citizens to pursue technology and grow your own economy with your own people and keep all the skills, money, and knowledge right here at home. The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. 3 posted on 12/02/2025 8:42:38 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination.

Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans.

As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA.

The government has to make some serious changes to make technology a good field again. FIFY. The H1B program might have had some good ideas in the beginning, but it has far outlived that purpose. The brain drain long ago reached diminishing returns. Nowadays Indian visa holders get into positions of management and then only hire other Indians. They really do act like they think all Americans are stupid. If you manage to get hired they will do what they can to drive you out of that position. Put an Indian in charge of a company and the more Indians they’ll import telling US workers to get stuffed These filthy pagans are all over banking. They get into HR and only hire other filthy pakis and pagans. They don’t bathe, they don’t wash their hands and their food stinks. Canceling T-mobile because they just made one CEO. “cheap foreign labor” Do tell, just like reliving my frustration this morning that MS Word STILL doesn’t remember printer settings. Asshats. Happened to me in 2008 - crash and everything Changed EVERYTHING I once knew as normal Just like we need to get non-English speaking immigrants from driving 18-wheelers, we need most of our tech to be Americans. Now that the H1B problem is impacting both tech and trade jobs, I hope that Americans will rally against overuse of H1B's. 1. Like almost any STEM field, it is universal in nature and therefore easily transferable across borders. 2. It doesn't require professional licensure. The second one is a big one, because it's what sets an IT professional apart from, say, a medical doctor, a professional engineer, lawyer, or a CPA. The educational requirements for licensure in some of these fields represent a high barrier to entry for foreigners who might otherwise be qualified to do the work. 2.

The program may have a need but we have no plenty of programmers in country. I worked with a French H1B who was excellent, but the generic Asian programmers I worked with were all average, at best. Resume stuffing, massive use of AI and earlier computer helps. Lots of output (sometimes) but cludgy code that creates more problems than it solves. Kinda like modern M$ … I want my... I want my... I want my H 1 B.... Look at them yo-yos. That’s the way you do it... I saw the writing on the wall after we fixed the Y2K problem and switched from being a COBOL programmer to being a business analyst. The latter is communication intensive, which is harder for Indians with broken English to tackle. It served me well until I retired four years ago. However, I dearly loved being a COBL programmer and really hated business analysis. But it paid the bills. Same here. Retired four years ago after almost 40 years in mainframe environments. Th H1B visa program should be canceled. It has been misused to the point of destroying STEM for Americans. It reduces opportunities and salaries for Americans. And it strip mines human capital from foreign nations. My dear son-in-law is caught in this mess. He is one of the smartest men I know, and has put out hundreds of resumes since graduating in 2022. He took a job as a security guard to pay the bills. One of Mr.GG2’s friends has been out of work for over 5 years due to this carp. He’s A coder and previously made over $200,000 per year. Now he’s blackballed. Being ultra conservative and 100% American isn’t cool. Why do people act like H-1B is something new...

Title: Betrayed American Workers Expose Dark Underbelly Of H-1B Visa Scheme

They were promised lucrative and stable careers if they “learned to code” and earned a degree in software engineering. Instead, many Americans in the tech industry have been left disillusioned as they face mass layoffs and chronic unemployment — a crisis they say stems from an addiction to cheap foreign labor pipelines that are made accessible through programs like H-1B, and are touted by companies as a way to hire the “best and brightest.” (RELATED: Major Democrat Donor Has Sizeable Stake In Pot Company Raided By ICE) “At this point, I’m doing something else,” Jonathan, a cybersecurity professional who is leaving the industry entirely out of frustration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “My career is basically dead in the water because of these problems.” Jonathan lost his job in the industry in November 2024 and in the months since, he’s submitted well over 200 applications for tech-related positions in the Seattle area, but received a grand total of zero offers — despite five years of experience and purportedly demonstrating high competency in every interview assessment thrown his way. He wished to be identified only by his first name out of fear of retribution from past and potential employers, as did most of the seven tech employees who spoke with the DCNF. Controversy surrounding the H-1B program, which very publicly split President Donald Trump’s inner circle shortly before he began his second term, has once again shot onto the national scene as the White House gives mixed signals on the program’s benefits. The issue has proven divisive for the Republican leader, who was elected to office on a pro-worker platform, but also has powerful allies in the tech world. When reached for comment, the White House referred to recent statements made by press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “The president does not support American workers being replaced,” Leavitt told a group of reporters earlier in November. “The president has a very nuanced, common-sense opinion on this issue … but ultimately [he] wants to see American workers in those jobs… There’s been a lot of misunderstanding of the president’s position.” Public data suggests that many American engineers are being passed over for foreign workers. Throughout 2025, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Intel underwent layoffs — continuing what has been a years-long trend in the industry. The workers interviewed by the DCNF were not employed at these specific tech companies. Roughly 428,000 tech workers lost their job between 2022 and 2023, and a total of 384 tech companies handed pink slips to roughly 124,000 workers in 2024, according to the Institute for Sound Public Policy (ISPP). While H-1Bs have an outsized influence on the tech world, workers across all major industries are impacted by imported foreign labor. The flow of H-1B workers into the U.S. has largely kept apace despite these mass layoffs, with the ISPP finding that the number of H-1B visa workers has grown 80% since the Great Recession low in 2011. Experts estimate that nearly 660,000 H-1B workers were living in the U.S. in October 2024. Established by Congress in 1990, the H-1B program was originally intended to utilize “highly specialized” foreign labor, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Although it’s a nonimmigrant visa, H-1B holders can eventually become eligible to apply for legal permanent residence, allowing them to stay in the country indefinitely. The tech industry dominates the use of H-1Bs, with tech companies accounting for nearly 70% of H-1B petitions annually, according to Nation Connections, a site dedicated to helping individuals navigate immigration laws in different countries. Other American-born tech workers have shared similar experiences to Jonathan’s, and have stayed silent due to fear of retaliation. “I do feel kind of disillusioned with the industry,” said Riley, who graduated with a software engineering degree in 2021. “Software engineers have a higher unemployment rate right now than art history majors.” Art history majors have a 3% unemployment rate, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which compiled data released in February. Computer engineering majors, on the other hand, currently suffer from a 7.5% unemployment rate. LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY – AUGUST 08: An employee works in a 3-D scan lab at GE Appliances on August 08, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images for GE Appliances, a Haier company) Riley said he noticed a monumental shift in the hiring practices of an Austin-based company he worked at for several years. He claims the company — which had faced consistent complaints from engineers about pay — increasingly staffed its engineering departments with employees from South America and eventually established an office in Colombia to better utilize the continent’s workforce. “I believe that that was done in order to, you know, reduce their labor costs so that they could get engineers without negotiating with [the American-born engineers] or caving to their demands,” Riley said. Jonathan described a similar situation after the California-based company he worked for introduced an India development center. Roughly six months after the center was launched, he said the company stopped hiring outside of India altogether. About a year after he left, Jonathan’s former coworker informed him that around half of the company’s security personnel was let go. “You’re going to lose advancement opportunities, you’re going to have HR problems and you’re going to be not a team player if you don’t advocate with open arms the idea of an Indian development center being opened up to your company or a billion H-1Bs flooding the market,” Jonathan said about the situation he was facing and the continued pressure to not speak out. India stands far above any other nation as the top source of foreign labor, making up 72% of all H-1B recipients between October 2022 and September 2023, per a March 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re all in the process of being replaced,” John, who worked for an insurance company in Connecticut, told the DCNF. John said there were around 350 IT employees — all purportedly American — at his company when he first began in 2006. Throughout his decade at the company, he claims they were all steadily booted out in favor of foreign workers. “Most of the time they had them train their Indian replacements before they left as a condition of receiving their severance,” he told the DCNF. “So what I saw over a period of time was a whole bunch of lives being destroyed.” “A lot of the younger kids can’t find employment,” John said of the industry. “They spent a whole bunch of money learning all of this stuff — computer programs, cloud platforms, this that the other thing — but they can’t find work.” The tech employees who spoke to the DCNF are struggling to find work in the U.S. at a time when college debt has skyrocketed to historical highs. Roughly 44 million Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Engineering degrees in general are consistently ranked as one of the costliest to earn. Like his coworkers before him, John was ultimately “replaced” and handed a severance agreement that forbids him from discussing the matter publicly. WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 19: President Donald Trump holds up an executive order establishing the “Trump Gold Card” in the Oval Office at the White House on September 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “Coming home to western Washington from Alaska, I assumed that finding a better-paying job would be no issue — we are home to some of the nation’s largest tech companies,” Luke Hawthorne told the DCNF. “I spent nearly a year over 2022 and 2023 searching for my current job, a job which pays me about the same as I was making before.” While Hawthorne still considers himself lucky to be employed, he said his current salary “doesn’t even approach” the threshold it takes to afford a home in his area of Washington State. His home state’s software developer workforce grew by more than 16% through H-1B certifications over just a 9-month period, with 83% of these positions approved at or below Washington State’s median wage, according to public data he analyzed and shared with the DCNF. “The ‘best and brightest’ argument simply doesn’t square with how the program is being used,” Hawthorne said. “Another important aspect of it is that you aren’t competing just with the new arrivals, but with all of the tech workers who have been replaced — I have friends with talent and experience who have been out of work for years.” Many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF have since become involved with U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group that highlights the plight of American employees negatively affected by the H-1B program and pushes Washington, D.C., for change. Trump, who has implemented some of the most hawkish immigration policies since returning to office, has appeared to give mixed signals on the issue as major players within his own inner circle disagree over reform. The president’s coalition appeared fragmented in the weeks leading up to his second presidential inauguration, with business magnate Elon Musk touting H-1Bs in December 2024 and Vivek Ramaswamy suggesting that the U.S. needs foreign talent because American culture “venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former a top Trump ally who is resigning from Congress, said in November she would introduce legislation completely phasing out the H-1B program, accusing tech companies of abusing the system at the expense of Americans. Trump initially appeared to side with the pro-H-1B faction, declaring in December 2024 that he was “a believer” in the visa program. In what appeared to be a major shift into the pro-American worker camp, Trump in September signed a proclamation slapping a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B applications, but opponents of the program have criticized the fee’s limitations and workarounds. Earlier in November, Trump once again publicly touted the need for H-1Bs to import foreign workers. As Washington, D.C., continues to debate the value of H-1Bs, American tech workers say they’ve been left out to dry. “I graduated college seven years ago and I remember in high school them telling us, ‘learn to code and you’ll have a good job,'” Joseph Ibrahim, an unemployed tech worker based in Florida, told the DCNF. “Well, it turns out they outsource the coding jobs also, not just the manufacturing jobs.” Ibrahim got a degree in information systems, business analytics and information systems, but has been struggling to find work since April. Unlike many of the tech workers who spoke to the DCNF, he had no problem being identified by his full name. “What are they gonna do?” Ibrahim asked. “They’re already not hiring me.” “You know, if I went into college and on the pamphlet, there were like, ‘pros and cons of studying something in computer science: you may have to train your replacement at some point in your career,’ I would have never studied this,” he said.

Title: Warner Bros.’ Bidding War Escalates: Here Are the Challenges Facing Comcast, Netflix and Paramount | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-12-02T14:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The three companies are in hot pursuit for all or part of Warner Bros. Discovery, but they each have their own regulatory and political hurdles As Warner Bros. Discovery’s board mulls over a second round of bids from Paramount, Comcast and Netflix, a factor it’ll have to consider is just how easily a deal will get approved by regulators. That was the crux of a lot of the chatter that emerged in the days leading up to the Monday deadline, which saw the three companies submitting new, binding offers for all or parts of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to various press reports. Netflix showing strong interest in WBD’s assets, including making a mostly cash offer to acquire them, coincided with reports that the White House had antitrust concerns, while Comcast, which also submitted a bid, still has to deal with the challenge that President Donald Trump loathes CEO Brian Roberts. Paramount also reportedly sweetened its bid with a reported all-cash offer financed by asset management firm Apollo Group and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and is selling itself as the easiest path to getting its deal done thanks to CEO David Ellison and his father’s cushy relationship with Trump. The new round of bids and the chatter signals how the stakes have gone up in the race for WBD. The winner would gain valuable streaming, IP and studio assets and, in the case of Paramount, also expand its cable TV footprint. Any of the three scenarios will lead to a massive reshaping of the entertainment industry and a further consolidation of power in Hollywood. TheWrap previously reported that a final decision is expected to be made around Christmas. Netflix and Paramount declined to comment, although a Paramount representative did not respond to a later request for a comment on the prospect of the sovereign wealth funds participating, which TheWrap previously reported on. Representatives for Warner Bros. and Comcast did not immediately return a request for comment. Until then, here’s a rundown of where each bidder stands and some of the regulatory challenges they each face. Out of all the players, Paramount Skydance would have the easiest time acquiring WBD, mostly because it has already played this game. The company is fresh off Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, which cleared in August. Since it already secured FCC approval from the Trump administration before, several experts, including LightShed Partners partner and technology analyst Rich Greenfield, have noted that the previous acquisition puts Paramount on the regulatory “fast track.” Another thing working in Paramount’s favor is its interest in the company overall as well as its deep pockets. Out of the three companies interested in bidding on Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount is the only one that wants the full company and not just the Warner Bros. studio and streaming division. Yep, it wants cable too. Paramount noted it would increase the amount paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80%, bumping up the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. It’s also clear that Paramount really really wants this. Whereas Comcast and Netflix only submitted one previous bid, this marks Paramount Skydance’s fourth bid. The first three were rejected for being too low. Additionally, Zaslav may be personally interested in selling to Paramount. CEO Ellison offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title as part of his Warner offer. So what’s working against Paramount? Concerns over the theatrical division will be a hurdle, since Paramount acquiring WBD will drop the number of major film studios from five to four. But perhaps the main obstacle to clear is one that can’t be measured by hard financial figures. It’s only been four months since Ellison took control of Paramount. So far, the only things to come out of that acquisition have been a lot of layoffs and departures (bye, over 1,000 employees and gone-in-2028 Taylor Sheridan) as well as several headline grabbing deals (“South Park” and UFC’s deals are in the billions). Simply put, it’s way too early to know if the Ellison era is a good — and lucrative — era of the company. Despite the creative-friendly reputation Ellison has in the industry, that’s sure to be a concern. At first glance, Comcast taking over Warner Bros. makes the most sense. Both companies house legacy Hollywood institutions — NBCUniversal and Warner Bros., respectively. Thanks to its movie studio arm, Comcast understands the challenges of theatrical, and because of Peacock, it understands the headaches around streaming. Comcast is also reportedly the preferred option for WBD head Zaslav. Two struggling giants teaming up to combat this difficult landscape is a matchup that works, like Godzilla and King Kong teaming up to take down the Skar King (IP, folks!). The problems come down to money, possible theatrical overreach and Trump. It’s widely believed that Comcast’s pockets aren’t as deep as the Ellison family’s Oracle-powered fortune. That being said, according to the New York Post, Comcast CEO Roberts was considering a potential offer that could reach as high as $28 a share for just the studio and streaming business. As for the theatrical side of the business, Comcast will face the same questions as Paramount. At the moment, there are only five major movie studios: Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. Two of them being owned by the same company will raise some regulatory eyebrows no matter which companies are involved. Other than cash, it’s the Trump administration that may also pose a major threat to Comcast scooping up Warner Bros. The president has been outspoken about his dislike of Roberts, calling the CEO “a disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting” on Truth Social. Though NBCUniversal will be spinning its cable assets off into Versant sometime early next year, Comcast’s ownership of MSNBC (now MS NOW) could rub Trump the wrong way. Comcast also owns NBC, which is home to Seth Meyers’ “Late Night,” which last month drew Trump’s ire as he called for the host to be fired. As the “60 Minutes” lawsuit ahead of Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount demonstrated, Trump isn’t above dangling FCC approval to make major media networks act the way he wants. Like Comcast, Netflix only wants Warner Bros., which encompasses Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming and studio divisions. Let’s start with the positives. Warner Bros. Discovery has warmed up to Netflix’s potential bid, Gasparino reported. Netflix has always had a healthy respect for Warner. Way back in 2012, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos famously said, “We’re going to become HBO before HBO could become us.” Acquiring the company behind HBO — especially during a time when Netflix is interested in “selective” merger and acquisition deals — would be a big step in that direction. Netflix also has deep pockets and has proven it’s willing to overspend to get what it wants. But that’s about where the pro-Netflix argument ends. Because Netflix is notoriously against showing movies in theaters, its interest in acquiring one of the five big movie studios has ruffled the feathers of many in the industry, especially since theater attendance is down nearly 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels. If Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros., it’s hard to say whether it would abandon its current strategy and lean into theaters or if it would continue to make its movies streaming-first. And if Netflix did lean into theaters, that leads to a whole other set of issues. Netflix would have to learn the international theatrical ropes in a very short amount of time. But the biggest argument against Netflix is that it’s simply too big. Netflix is consistently the top premium streamer when it comes to Nielsen’s monthly The Gauge reports. If it were to acquire HBO Max as well, the ensuing streamer would be an even bigger behemoth in a landscape where it dominates. Government officials are already thinking about antitrust concerns if there is a Netflix acquisition. That potential investigation has been compared to the lengthy antitrust investigations Google and Amazon underwent and that Netflix has avoided so far. Overcoming those regulatory hurdles from the Department of Justice would likely take more than two years before it even goes to court, according to the New York Post. It’s unclear if Netflix or Warner Bros. would want to undergo this joint headache. Ironically, what could save Netflix is YouTube. If the case can be made that YouTube, which consistently leads the Nielsen charts, is the actual entertainment leader, Netflix may be able to acquire Warner Bros. without antitrust concerns. It just comes down to how well YouTube’s user-generated content can be separated from Netflix’s premium content.

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy

Time Published: 2025-12-01T21:00:04Z

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views

Watch CBS News Updated on: December 1, 2025 / 3:43 PM EST / CBS News Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts. Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago. The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market. Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said. "A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less," Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. "So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth." He added, "This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did." Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April. Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few "big ticket" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck. Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers. Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays. Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. Spending among the bottom 80% of households — or those earning less than $175,000 a year — has "simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic," Zandi wrote in a September social media post. That's creating a so-called K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs. "Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer," Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. "Widening behavioral gap — high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious." For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted. "So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well," he said. "Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too."

Title: The K-shaped economy means inflation hurts at the bottom and swells the assets at the top

From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones.

Title: How to handle ‘nepo babies’ in this economic climate

Good morning! It’s no secret that the job market for Gen Z isn’t great—and many young people rely on their parents for help, ranging from financial support to health insurance to job leads. One 2024 study found that more than half of Gen Z asked their parents to find them job opportunities, with 53% of that group reporting that their parents had found them jobs to apply to through personal connections. Julia Lamm, PwC’s principal of workforce solutions, told me she suspects more parents will be trying to pull strings for their adult kids in this economic climate. But how should workplaces deal with “nepo babies”? Lamm had a few suggestions to make sure the hiring process is still fair, and those without connections aren’t shut out. “The really good companies will completely blind [the connection] from the decision-making process so you don’t even know it’s a referral,” she said. “You try to hide that so that it’s inherently an unbiased process.” If that proves impossible—as is often the case when the referred person is related to an owner, founder, or executive at a company—Lamm suggests thinking about a revamp of how entry-level employees engage with the company. One firm she works with is considering a rotational program for junior employees to get hands-on experience with different parts of the company. “It’s to truly support the development of the nepo babies so that if they do rise to a role in the organization that’s going to be a leadership role, they will be credible,” she said. “They will have the experience, and they will be able to properly steer the organization so that the ‘nepo’ part was just opening the door, and they do the rest.” Nepo friends should be treated in a similar fashion. In addition to blind hiring processes, Lamm recommends making sure those employees that were hired by friends in leadership roles be subject to secondary, unbiased reviewers during performance review season. “Sometimes what happens is you … bring your friend on over, and because they were successful in another organization, you think they’re going to be successful here,” Lamm said. “That is not always the case.

Title: He predicted an automation crisis years ago. Now, Andrew Yang says AI may wipe out 40 million jobs over the next decade.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Andrew Yang has warned for several years that automation would upend the American workforce. In the run-up to his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he predicted that self-driving cars alone could displace a million mostly male truck drivers with limited education — a shift that could "destabilize society" and even trigger "riots in the street," he told The New York Times in 2018. Seven years later, Yang says the crisis he feared is no longer hypothetical. "It's aging very, very well, unfortunately," he told CNN's Michael Smerconish of his predictions in a recent interview. Recent analyses indicate that AI and automation are already capable of performing a significant share of US labor tasks and are reshaping employment. MIT's Iceberg Index, released last week, found that current AI systems can already technically perform skills representing 11.7% of the US labor market — roughly $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services. The New York Times, citing internal Amazon strategy documents and interviews, reported in October that the company believes automation could allow it to avoid hiring more than 600,000 US workers over the next few years, and that its robotics team has an ultimate goal of automating 75% of its operations. Salesforce, Walmart, HP, IBM, and Fiverr have all cited AI in recent rounds of layoffs or announced layoffs tied to AI. "44% of American jobs are either repetitive manual or repetitive cognitive and thus could be subject to AI and automation," Yang said in the interview with CNN. "We're seeing that unfold right now." Yang's 44% estimate is broadly in line with some major studies on automation. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it. A McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report released last month found that technologies could theoretically automate more than half of US work hours. Yang pushed back against Roman Yampolskiy, a computer science professor at the University of Louisville and an AI safety researcher, who in September predicted 99% unemployment within five years. "It's going to get bad. I certainly don't think 99% bad," Yang said. Using his 44% vulnerability benchmark, Yang offered a rough projection: if the US "churns through" even half of those jobs over the next decade, the country could see 30 to 40 million positions eliminated. "That would be devastating," he said. "That would be catastrophic for many, many communities." The rapid pace of AI-driven disruption has revived Yang's signature policy idea: a universal basic income that gives every American adult $1,000 a month, no strings attached. He said guaranteed cash would help workers survive the shockwaves of automation and maintain basic economic stability. To fund a nationwide program, Yang said the firms driving AI's explosive growth should bear the cost. He cited Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who floated to Axios in May the idea of a "token tax" that the government should levy on AI companies. With tech giants generating "hundreds of billions" in value — powered in part by data the public never knowingly provided — Yang said an AI tax or "compute tax" could raise "very big numbers very quickly." Given that the US produced roughly $85,000 in GDP per person in 2024, according to the World Bank, Yang said his $12,000 annual Freedom Dividend "seems pretty modest and reasonable." Yang said that a cash stipend isn't a cure-all — people also need purpose, structure, and a sense of community. But without financial stability, he said, millions risk being left behind and pushed toward radicalization. "We could be doing much, much more for the millions of Americans who are going to be displaced," Yang said. Jump to

HP will cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs by 2028 as the company leans into AI adoption, CEO Enrique Lores said during a Q4 earnings call. This "company-wide initiative [aims to] drive customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement," HP says. The layoffs will primarily affect those in product development, internal operations, and customer support roles, and are expected to be implemented by the end of fiscal year 2028. HP expects the job cuts to save nearly $1 billion by the end of 2028. "Structural cost savings represent gross reductions in costs driven by operational efficiency, digital transformation, and portfolio optimization," HP says. "These initiatives include but are not limited to workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation and productivity measures undertaken by HP, which HP expects to be sustainable in the longer-term." Lores promised to provide "the full plan on how AI is transforming HP" at the company's Investor Day on April 23. HP cut a similar number of jobs in 2022; it also laid off 9,000 people in 2019. As of October 2024, HP's headcount reportedly stood at 58,000, meaning the recently announced layoffs could reduce the workforce by about 7-10%. Notably, the company's PC business closed the fiscal year with a net revenue of $10.4 billion, an 8% year-over-year growth, while its printer business brought in $4.3 billion, down 4% year over year. HP now joins a long list of tech giants announcing layoffs due to AI-driven restructuring or cost cuts. Intel said it would reduce 15% of its workforce in June; Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs in July; Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October; and Verizon just cut 13,000 jobs last month.

Title: FedEx to close Texas logistics hub, cutting 856 jobs as âforever layoffâ trend grows

FedEx is closing a Coppell, Texas facility and permanently laying off 856 employees. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider. This follows other recent FedEx job cuts across North Texas facilities. The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider.

The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The American worker is under siege again, this time in the heart of Texas. In a move that exposes the fragile state of our economy and the disposable view corporations often hold of their workforce, FedEx is shuttering a Coppell logistics facility and laying off 856 employees. The cuts, set to begin in January with the facility closing by April 2026, follow the loss of a major customer to a competitor. This isn't an isolated incident but part of an unsettling pattern of endless job cuts eroding the foundation of the American middle class. FedEx, in its filing with the Texas Workforce Commission, coldly stated the reason: âThis action is necessitated solely by our customerâs decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider.â With that bureaucratic language, nearly 900 livelihoods are deemed expendable. The company noted the closure is âexpected to be permanent.â A pattern of cuts across North Texas The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers. Job review service Glassdoor notes this trend is expected to âstoke worker anxiety as it continues in 2026.â The data is alarming. Layoffs of fewer than 50 people, which made up just 38% of cuts in 2015, now account for 51%. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas observed, âOver the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so itâs surprising to see so many in October.â The brutal timing of these announcements, often just before the holidays, shows an erosion of corporate conscience. The broader landscape is bleak. Major pillars of employment like Amazon, UPS, and Target have announced tens of thousands of job cuts recently. UPS alone has cut about 48,000 jobs this year. Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Why Cyber Monday could break spending records despite economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Deals promoted as some of the best of the holiday season are expected to keep people across the United States glued to their computers and smartphones on Cyber Monday. It’s no secret that buying things online is a staple of many people’s everyday routines. And year after year, those purchases mount during the gift-giving holiday rush. Experts expect consumers to drive record Cyber Monday spending this year, even amid wider economic uncertainty. The firm predicts that buy now, pay later loans will reach a new $1 billion milestone, the vast majority involving purchases made on mobile devices AI-assisted shopping is the talk of the holiday shopping season NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season. They hope to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases still are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Shoppers spend billions on Black Friday to snag holiday deals, despite wider economic uncertainty NEW YORK (AP) — Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year’s holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday — spending billions of dollars both in stores and online. Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. In-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that in-store Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024 — but that's notably better than a decline of 6.2% seen in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Consumers should do their research before giving in to Travel Tuesday temptation NEW YORK (AP) — Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it’s Small Business Saturday. In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday. On the same day as the nonprofit world’s Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency. Trump commutes prison sentence for former private equity executive David Gentile HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of a former investment manager convicted of defrauding investors. It's the latest in a series of clemency actions Trump has taken in white-collar criminal cases. David Gentile had been convicted for his role in what the Justice Department at the time described as a scheme to defraud investors. His firm had raised $1.6 billion to acquire companies. The White House said the firm had disclosed to investors that their capital might go to pay dividends to other investors — undercutting claims that it had engaged in a “Ponzi” scheme in which new investments are used to reimburse previous investors. A lost generation of news consumers? Survey shows how teenagers dislike the news media NEW YORK (AP) — You don't have to tell Cat Murphy or Lily Ogburn about the attitudes of young people toward journalists. The profession hasn't been popular among adults for many years, but a new survey shows the extent to which teens aged 13 to 18 feel the same way; Murphy and Ogburn have seen it for years among their friends who wonder why they want to go into the field. Experts say it's a combination of their surroundings, including the most prominent politician they have known — Donald Trump — who frequently denounces “fake news” — and a lack of understanding of journalism's role in society. Trump says Venezuelan airspace should be viewed as closed. Maduro government slams 'colonial threat' WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The Venezuelan government is accusing President Donald Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty. That charge comes after Trump's social media post Saturday that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety.” His assertion raises more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The White House isn't responding to questions about what Trump meant by his post. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry says “such declarations constitute a hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act.” The Federal Aviation Administration's jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. Vote count under way in Honduras to elect new president in a close race after Trump’s intervention TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Poll workers have begun tallying Hondurans’ votes as the country moves to elect a new president only days after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced he would pardon a former president. Voting was extended an hour beyond the original closing time in many locations to accommodate remaining voters. No major voting problems were initially reported by electoral authorities. Voters will also elect a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions. Shoppers hit Black Friday sales with celebratory mood despite economic strain NEW YORK (AP) — The economic picture hasn’t looked very rosy. Hiring has been sluggish. Consumers have been hit with soaring meat prices. Layoffs are rippling through companies. But despite those concerns, shoppers were hitting the stores in full strength on Black Friday. They were sipping champagne as they searched for discounts on the day that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more selective with their purchases while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the winter holidays. Venezuelan leader Maduro may seem desperate. But his loyalty vs punishment strategy is hard to crack CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was once critical of English. But he now sings John Lennon’s "Imagine" and promotes peace with his newest catchphrase “No War, Yes Peace.” Venezuela’s opposition says this is a display of desperation. Opposition leaders hoped military threats would weaken Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party's leadership continues to hold despite the U.S. military buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast. The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Title: Threat To Jobs, Democracy: Why Over 1,000 Amazon Employees Are Pushing Back Against Its AI Policy

In what is being seen as one of the largest internal protest at a tech firm, more than 1,000 employees have signed an open letter warning against the impact of the company's strong AI push. The letter, reviewed by The Guardian, points out AI's triple threat to employment, democracy and climate. Staff from across tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft have backed the letter and engineers, product managers and warehouse workers from Amazon are among the signatories. The letter comes in the backdrop of layoffs made by Amazon as part of its AI expansion plan through scaling up the use of artificial intelligence tools across operations; in turn, prompting questions around crucial topics like job security, workplace surveillance and environmental impact. The layoff announcements in recent period have been seen through the prism of multibillion-dollar commitments for new AI-linked data centres in the US along with rapid AI automations. This is something which has compounded fears of further job cuts, on top of an already mounting pressures related to higher productivity quotas. A senior software engineer was quoted by The Guardian as saying that employees are feeling the pressure to use AI tools for coding and writing, and underscored that management now expects "twice as much work because of AI tools". Another worker highlighted that the use of AI tools is being used as a justification for random productivity quotas despite the tools not bridging the gap. The worker-led initiative also calls upon Amazon to ensure that its data centres run on clean energy so as not to deteriorate the climate situation further. Moreover, it also demands restricting AI products that could encourage and enable "violence, surveillance and mass deportation", and creation of worker-led bodies to oversee how AI is deployed internally. The protest at one of the world’s largest technology companies has become a symbol of growing internal distress among workers along with their resistance to generative AI is reshaping workflows and power dynamics.

Title: If you were laid off, you could 'boomerang' back to your old company. Here's who's more likely to be asked back.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sometimes a layoff isn't a farewell forever. Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle "AI-induced pressures" and economic uncertainty. "In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent," Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. "In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know," Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. "Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees," she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. "Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job — nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore," Derler said. "Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know." Derler said all parties need to have good "layoff hygiene," where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your résumé or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin — not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. "When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call," she said. "Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them." Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

Title: Want to work from home? Here's how 7 people got their managers on board — or secured flexibility themselves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of battling LA traffic, Leslie Snipes decided it was time to talk to her manager. For the first few months of her job as a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency, she drove 60 to 90 minutes to the office a few days a week — but the commute eventually began to take a toll. "I was wasting hours just sitting in traffic," said the 34-year-old. In April of last year, Snipes decided to ask her manager whether she could work remotely almost exclusively. She explained that she'd be more productive working from home and that her team's strongest bonding often happened during business trips and off-site projects. Snipes said she received verbal approval in less than a day — and that she now typically works from the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," she said. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." While some workers are more than happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, Business Insider spoke to seven people who have found ways to secure flexible work arrangements — whether or not they're officially sanctioned. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work, said work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years, despite companies' implementing stricter return-to-office mandates. He believes that's offset by other employers — many of them smaller companies and startups — offering more flexibility. He also hypothesizes that employees are securing exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. Bloom pointed out a possible motivating factor for allowing these exceptions: Managers are generally judged on how their teams perform, and they don't want to risk their best talent quitting or becoming less productive if they're forced back to the office. For this reason, some managers may choose not to enforce office attendance policies too strictly. "Managers ultimately care about their team performance," he said. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers about how they've responded to corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and return-to-office mandates.

Read more on the topic: Childcare responsibilities are a common factor pushing workers to secure work-from-home flexibility. In November 2024, Georg Loewen began working as a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency with a three-day-a-week in-office policy, which required him to make a roughly one-hour commute from New Jersey to Manhattan. But that commute proved challenging. Loewen was responsible for dropping off his one-year-old daughter at day care most mornings, and the 8 a.m. drop-off often made it difficult to catch the ideal 8:20 train that would get him to the office just before 9 — the next one wouldn't get him in until after 10. Even when he was on time, finding a parking spot at the station wasn't guaranteed. Early this year, Loewen's manager initiated a conversation about his challenges getting into the office. Eventually, they came to an agreement. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said the 34-year-old. Loewen said he typically works from the office once or twice a week. His current routine involves dropping off his daughter, heading home to park his car, and then riding a foldable bike 1.5 miles to the station, which allows him to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot. He said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but added that he's consistently felt supported. He may need to work from the office more frequently as his team grows, he said, but for now, he's grateful for the leeway he's been given. A Wisconsin-based mother of three is similarly thankful for the flexible understanding she came to with her manager. In 2023, she'd considered leaving her corporate manufacturing role after the company announced a five-day-a-week office policy. She worried she couldn't meet her childcare responsibilities with a two-hour round-trip commute. Instead, she had an "off the record" conversation with her manager about how much remote work she could get away with. She said they told her to "be here as much as you can." As long as she was in the office a few days a week — especially on days with key in-person meetings — they wouldn't stand in her way. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Some workers have found creative ways to spend less time at the office. When Elysa Ellis began looking for a new role last year, she was hesitant to give up the remote work flexibility she'd grown used to. After landing an interview with a local nonprofit that required employees to work from the office five days a week, she came with a prepared request: a 9-to-3 schedule, instead of the typical 9-to-5. Ellis said it was important for her to be able to pick up her two children from school around 3 p.m. and spend time with them until her husband finished work. "My children are young, so I knew that stepping into an in-office role would impact them a lot," she said, adding, "I felt like I had nothing to lose." By the time Ellis was offered the job, her request had been granted. She would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — and still receive her full salary. In 2022, when a millennial IT professional heard rumors that his employer might implement a stricter return-to-office policy, he began searching for a new role. Shortly after, he landed an offer for a remote position similar to his current role. However, he was hesitant to resign while his company's official policy still allowed remote work, so he decided to secretly juggle both roles — earning $250,000 annually, roughly double his previous income. And if his initial employer ever adopted a stricter in-office policy, he figured he had a backup plan. "I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much," he said. For a millennial finance manager at Amazon, maximizing his work-from-home time meant doing the bare minimum at the office. When Amazon announced in 2023 that it would require corporate employees to work from the office three days a week, he began going in the required number of days — but only worked between nine and 12 hours total across all three days. He said it was feasible because he was the only member of his team based at that office. "I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement," he said. For some, the simplest way to secure work-from-home flexibility is to find a job that offers it from day one. After being laid off from a remote job, a New Jersey-based e-commerce professional landed an offer last year for a role at JPMorgan — one that would require him to commute to a Manhattan office three days a week. As he considered the offer, he estimated that commuting would take nine hours a week and cost him more than $7,000 a year. Around the same time, he received another offer — this one for a remote role with a salary about $5,000 lower than the JPMorgan position. When he compared the two jobs in terms of what he'd earn for every hour he'd have to "invest" in them — factoring in both commuting time and related costs — he said the decision was easy. "JPMorgan just could not compete," he said, adding: "A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering." Jump to
