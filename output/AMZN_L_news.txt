Title: Jeff Shultz, Paramount’s Streaming Strategy Chief, Is Exiting
URL: https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/jeff-shultz-paramount-streaming-out-1236182626/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T19:04:06Z

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Jeff Shultz, who has served as chief strategy officer and chief business development officer of Paramount Global‘s streaming division, is leaving the company at the end of the year. Shultz joined Paramount in 2019 as part of the acquisition of Pluto TV and was a key executive on the leadership team that launched and grew the Paramount+ subscription service. He has overseen strategy, distribution and business development for both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Shultz announced that he will leave Paramount Global in a post Friday on LinkedIn. “To my colleagues at Paramount Streaming, writing this incredible story with you has been the honor of my career,” he wrote. “I’m sorry I won’t be with you for the next chapter, but I can’t wait to see where you go from here.” Related Stories VIP+ ‘Until Dawn,’ ‘Silent Hill 2’ Remakes Show Relevancy of Retreading IP Kamala Harris To Make First Late Night Appearance as Presidential Nominee This Tuesday on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' Paramount is expanding the role of Ray Hopkins, president of U.S. networks distribution, to now include streaming and linear partners/distribution, the company’s three co-CEOs — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — announced in an internal memo Friday. As a result of this shift, Shultz “will be departing the organization and the Streaming [distribution and business development] team will now transition under Ray,” the execs said in the memo. Popular on Variety In July, Paramount Global and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone clinched a deal to merge Paramount with Skydance Media, a transaction expected to close in the first half of 2025. In the meantime, Paramount has engaged in layoffs and restructuring in its U.S. workforce aimed at slashing 15% of its domestic headcount. Separately Friday, Paramount disclosed that Charles Phillips Jr., who led the board’s special committee on M&A that ultimately reached a deal to merge the company with Skydance, is exiting the board of directors. Shultz joined Pluto TV as chief business officer in early 2018, after serving as an adviser to the free, ad-supported streaming startup for three years. A year later, Viacom acquired the free, ad-supported streaming startup for $340 million. Tom Ryan, former CEO of Pluto TV, is now CEO of Paramount Streaming. Ryan, in a comment on Shultz’s LinkedIn post, said: “Jeff, thank you for everything you have done for Paramount Streaming. Pluto TV and Paramount+ would never have come so far so fast without your talent, drive, optimism and collaboration. We will be forever grateful for your immense contributions and you will be sorely missed.” “Six and a half years ago, celebrating the acquisition of Pluto TV by Viacom with the team in Santa Barbara, I gave a toast recognizing the moment that concluded: ‘We’re just getting started,'” Shultz wrote in the LinkedIn post. “Despite all we have accomplished since then, I still feel the same way. So with mixed emotions I share that I will be leaving Paramount later this year.” Shultz touted deals that he cut for Pluto TV’s service, including with the NFL, Major League Baseball, Warner Bros. Discovery, A+E Networks, AMC Networks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, MGM, Fremantle and Banijay Entertainment. Under his leadership, Pluto TV also inked partnership deals with Amazon, Roku, Google, Apple, T-Mobile, Verizon, Comcast, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Vizio and more. In 2019, the year Viacom acquired Pluto TV, the free streamer generated about $70 million in revenue; three years later, “Pluto TV was a billion-dollar business,” according to Shultz. In 2021, the company rebranded CBS All Access as Paramount+ to create the Paramount Streaming division. In the second quarter of 2024, the division reported revenue of $1.9 billion, representing one-fourth of Paramount Global revenue. Prior to Pluto TV, Shultz held senior leadership roles in digital business development at media companies including NBC and CBS, and internet TV startups Clicker and Concert TV, which he co-founded. In 2022, Shultz was named to Variety’s Dealmaker Impact Report. He began his career as a lawyer for Linklaters in London after earning a law degree from Georgetown University. In his LinkedIn post, Shultz said he was “deeply grateful for the leadership and friendship of Tom Ryan, and the partnership and excellence of the Paramount Streaming leadership team Elizabeth Wright, Domenic DiMeglio, Jeff Grossman, Amy Kuessner, Olivier Jollet, Marco Nobili, Erin Calhoun, and Abhinav Chopra.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Data centers try to cool it as AI explodes, and Big Tech goes nuclear
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/18/data-centers-try-cool-ai-explodes-big-tech-goes-nuclear/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:55:05Z

UPDATED 10:55 EDT / OCTOBER 18 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof What a turnaround for nuclear power — and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. This week two more Big Tech companies bet on nukes as Google and Amazon joined the party Microsoft started a few weeks ago. All that training of AI models takes a lot of power. And that’s despite, or because of, the fact that AI models are getting smaller and easier to use, as a raft of announcements this week made apparent. AI is also exploding the data center, as all the talk at the Open Compute Project’s Global Summit this week was about accommodating AI workloads — such as Crusoe’s plans for building an AI megafactory in Texas — and the massive increase in power, heat and networking needs they require. Indeed, as a result, networking is the not-so-new but now critical bottleneck in the data center. Companies such as Lightmatter and xScape Photonics are betting big on the opportunity. Paul Gillin lays out the very public Snowflake-Databricks clash in detail in the definitive story of the latest battle of the AI era. Ironically, given all the heat AI is producing, it’s about Apache Iceberg, the management layer that sits atop data files in cloud storage. Google shook up its management team, in particular in search and ads, as well as Gemini AI. It looks like DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has finally consolidated his hold on all things AI at Google. Down is up and up is down in the chip industry. In a hell-freezes-over moment, Intel and AMD decided to cooperate on standardizing the x86 chip instruction set. Meanwhile, TSMC and ASML issued widely different earnings results — chipmaker TSMC benefiting from roaring AI chip sales and equipment maker ASML suffering from a drop in sales to China and Samsung. Next week’s events include UiPath Forward and Celonis’ Celosphere, and we’ll have news and interviews on theCUBE from both. The enterprise earnings season kicks off with IBM, Seagate and SAP, ahead of a much large number of reports the following two weeks from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and many others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend for some lean-back reading. Meantime, check out this past week’s installment, zeroing in on Microsoft’s much-debated Azure revenue and what it means for the overall cloud market. Here’s all of this week’s top news, newsy topics and analysis from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Big-data dust-up: Why two AI giants are at war over who is more open Accel says generative AI startups get 40% of VC investment in cloud OpenAI, Microsoft reportedly hire banks to renegotiate partnership terms Generative AI churns the waters at European NoCode Summit The next phase of AI: Unlocking explainability with causal intelligence Mistral introduces Ministral 3B and 8B AI computing models for phones and laptops AWS and Databricks to deliver more affordable generative AI for joint customers H2O.ai releases small language models for multimodal processing tasks LatticeFlow releases framework for checking LLMs’ compliance with the EU AI Act Google looks to spearhead AI adoption in the public sector DataStax merges its data stack with Nvidia’s development tools to simplify AI development and fine-tuning Adobe introduces new generative AI features for its creative applications Domino Data Lab seeks to embed governance in AI development Cognizant enhances Neuro AI platform for faster AI use case deployment OutSystems integrates generative AI with low-code to accelerate and simplify app development Big data startup UltiHash unveils advanced deduplication to boost AI storage efficiency Terray Therapeutics rakes in $120M for AI-powered small molecule drug development AI startups Decagon and Neuron7 raise millions to transform customer service and repairs AI observability firm Galileo raises $45M to improve AI model accuracy Omnea raises $25M to streamline procurement with AI French AI startup Gladia raises $16M and launches multilingual real-time transcription engine Data science and AI development platform Zerve raises $7.6M Simplismart raises $7M to help enterprises run their own AI models with rapid inference and full control Amplitude buys Command AI to help companies integrate AI-assisted onboarding and product tours into software There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Completing the cloud nuclear trifecta after Microsoft last month announced it will tap into a reopened Three Mile Island: Google to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactor startup Kairos Power and Amazon to invest in three nuclear energy projects But these are all going to take years to produce energy, so it’s not going to solve the data center energy crunch anytime soon. At the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, which focuses on new technologies and standards for data centers, the talk was all about how AI is changing everything in the data center, and creating new problems to solve: * Does it seem hot in here?: If there’s one thing everyone’s freaking out about, it’s heat — specifically the heat generated by servers full of chips from Nvidia and other AI accelerator chipmakers. There were dozens of companies offering liquid-cooling solutions, considerably more than last year if I remember correctly. “You can no longer air-cool these servers,” said Saurabh Dighe, corporate VP for Microsoft Azure strategic planning and architecture. They need to be liquid-cooled.” * But AI chips aren’t the only source of heat. Copper wire works fine in individual data center racks, but with AI forcing more racks to be connected to tackle training of huge AI models, optical interconnects are becoming more and more critical — and those interconnects currently also take a lot of power and produce a lot of heat. “We need to get the power down,” said Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder and chief architect of Arista Networks. “We cannot change the laws of physics, but we can come up with better connectors.” That’s something established companies and startups such as Lightspeed are working hard to do. * Sustainability was the other, closely related byword at the summit. One standard being mulled is how to use “all that warm water from [cooling] data centers for more than just letting it evaporate in the air,” said Supermicro VP of Solutions Thomas Garvens. * But the problem with standards is that they take a lot of meetings and back-and-forth to establish. “Standards can take more time than we have in the era of AI,” said Google Principal Engineer Amber Huffman. * By the way, if it weren’t apparent already, networking looks to be the biggest bottleneck in the AI era. “The networking is essentially becoming the computer,” said Sameh Boujelgene of market researcher Dell’Oro Group. * ”Pigs can fly”: AMD EVP Forrest Norrod used that phrase to describe a deal between AMD and Intel to create an x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, which although not an OCP project was revealed onstage at the summit by Norrod and Intel EVP Justin Hotard. If Intel weren’t in such a hole, this never would have happened, given the decades of legal and market battles between the two. But if either of them wants to challenge Arm, whose designs are now powering data center chips for cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft, they need an instruction set as unified as Arm’s to ensure software compatibility among Intel and AMD chips and keep developers on the x86 train. Our story: Intel and AMD team up to improve the x86 processor architecture There was lots of other news, honestly a lot of pretty arcane stuff, but no surprise that Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang insists all data centers must become “AI factories,” captured so much attention: Nvidia aims to boost Blackwell GPUs by donating platform design to the Open Compute Project And this startup is betting big on one ginormous factory: Crusoe’s $3.4B joint venture to build AI data center campus with up to 100,000 GPUs Breaking Analysis: What Microsoft’s financial disclosures reveal about Azure’s market position And it may force other big companies to reveal more about their AI revenue. Private equity is bottom-fishing for software-as-a-service companies, which are increasingly being pressured by generative AI — not just because of investor interest but because chatbots have the potential to replace a good chunk of SaaS: Permira completes its $7.2B acquisition of Squarespace and Zuora to be acquired by Silverlake and GIC in $1.7B cash deal Intel reportedly seeking to sell minority stake in Altera at $17B valuation Lightmatter raises $400M at $4.4B valuation for next-gen photonic data center networking Xscape Photonics raises $44M to accelerate development of laser-based chip interconnects ASML shares plunge on lowered 2025 revenue forecast TSMC shares jump on expectation-topping third-quarter results Dialpad expands workforce management capabilities with Surfboard acquisition Developer tooling startup Port sails away with $35M in funding Everstage raises $30M to enhance sales performance management platform Lidar chip startup Lidwave closes $10M investment Clerk Chat raises $7M to simplify business text messaging VMware settles securities fraud class suit with $102.5M payout (per The Register) Salesforce launches customized financial services cloud platform for insurers HashiCorp debuts new Terraform Stacks and Vault updates at HashiConf 2024 Tableau Software updates data visualization and cloud analytics management SUSE enhances edge computing with new releases focused on scalability and efficiency Cato Networks expands SASE Cloud Platform with new Digital Experience Monitoring service Presidio expands AWS partnership to drive AI adoption and cloud migration We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Google enhances security and management for corporate-owned Android devices Akamai introduces Behavioral DDoS Engine and AI Assistance to strengthen security portfolio Bitdefender’s new AI copilot works in real time to protect consumers from online scams Lookout adds ‘smishing’ and executive impersonation protection to mobile security platform Nametag launches ‘Deepfake Defense’ and expands Okta partnership to combat AI impersonation OneSpan introduces VISION FX for phishing-resistant banking security Tenable brings intelligent data and AI resource security risk management to the cloud Cyera acquires Trail Security for $162M to expand AI-powered data security platform DeNexus expands cyber risk management platform with $17.5M investment More cybersecurity news here Amazon refreshes its Kindle e-reader lineup with four new devices FTC makes canceling subscriptions less of a pain with ‘click to cancel’ rule Google files for emergency stay against Epic lawsuit it lost — and it gets it Sam Altman’s Worldcoin rebrands as World and launches updated iris-scanning Orb Stripe reportedly in talks to acquire fintech startup Bridge for $1B Blockstream raises $210M to boost bitcoin blockchain layer 2 scaling technology Path Robotics secures $100M Series D funding for its AI-enabled robotic welding technology IoT startup Monogoto raises $27M to accelerate its global expansion And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Google reshuffles product leadership team and two AI units DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis gets the rest of Gemini, cementing his hold on all things AI at Google and elevating him to perhaps the No. 2 exec under Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Title: AWS CEO Matt Garman says employees could quit if they don't want to come into office

Amazon AWS CEO Matt Garman has said that employees who don't want to abide by the new rules coming into force next year, which will see workers come in for five days a week, can resign. Garman didn't seem to be saying it in an antagonistic way, just that some people may not work well in the new environment, and if not, there are always other companies around that will let you work from home. Garman made the remarks yesterday during an all-hands meeting. He said that 90% of employees he had spoken to were on board with the new policy, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. He was quoted as saying: "If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around. By the way, I don't mean that in a bad way, we want to be in an environment where we're working together. When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in person." As you'd expect, not everyone at the company is thrilled about the idea of spending extra time commuting. Some people point to the fact that the benefits of working in the office aren't supported by independent data. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has been running a three-day-in-the-office policy where workers go into work for just three days a week. Garman said that the switch to being in the office five days a week will eliminate the issue of missing colleagues if they choose to work on different days. Going into the office five days a week is pretty much a return to the situation before the pandemic. Amazon believes that workers will get more done in the office so it's eager to get back to that. As many tech firms are doing layoffs, it will be unlikely that many people quit their Amazon jobs over this issue as it may be hard to get another job.

Title: Amazon boss has a brutal response to staffers who don’t like 5-day RTO mandate: Leave
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/amazon-matt-garman-return-to-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don’t like it, they can work elsewhere. At an all-hands meeting for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn’t like the controversial policy, they should leave. The tech giant’s push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn’t been simple. In February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy’s call to return to the office for “the majority of the week.” In February 2023, that meant only three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025. In an internal call this week—first reported by Reuters—Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn’t want employees who couldn’t handle being in the office that frequently. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said, per Reuters. “By the way, I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he continued. He said he wanted staff to be “in an environment where we’re working together.” Garman said he isn’t seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos–founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: “When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we’re not in-person.” Given the fact that teams were in for three days—and not necessarily the same three days—“we didn’t really accomplish anything, like, we didn’t get to work together and learn from each other,” Garman reportedly added. Amazon did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. According to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, “nine out of 10” are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced. Perhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing—impacting their commute and family dynamics. “Amazon has announced 5-day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,” the staffer continued. “Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face uncertain prospects, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure. Meta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Google has a similar policy. Microsoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high. Amazon’s culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm. Current CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person and full-time, is getting in the way of these guiding ideas. Speaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: “You can’t internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.” Along with well-known ideas like Amazon’s “customer obsession,” there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree. “I don’t know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,” Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. “It’s very hard.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta layoffs are the latest sign that constant job cuts are the new Big Tech normal
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-indicate-tech-companies-like-recurring-layoffs-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:12:02Z
Full Content:
The hashtag affixed to Andy Welfle's LinkedIn photo says it all: #sickofthisshit. Welfle wrote earlier this month that he was laid off from Microsoft after only nine months. He'd previously spent nine months at Cruise before being laid off. His dual layoffs might have been worse than what many others experienced, but Welfle is hardly alone in getting hit by what appears to be some employers' penchant for regular layoffs, particularly in Silicon Valley. One of the latest examples is Meta, which said on Wednesday that it was rejiggering some of its biggest businesses, resulting in lost jobs at Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp. It wasn't clear how many roles were eliminated. A Meta spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday that the company was looking for other positions for affected workers. After shedding workers in sweeping layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, many tech companies are taking a more methodical, department-by-department approach to making cuts. Major firms including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced sizable reductions followed by more modest trimming. Take Google. The tech giant's parent company, Alphabet, began 2023 by cutting some 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its workforce. It followed that with smaller reductions this year. Art Zeile, the CEO of the tech-career marketplace Dice, told BI that some of the biggest companies in the industry had determined that certain departments were no longer sufficiently profitable and that they needed to redirect resources to growth areas like artificial intelligence. "It is a shifting of bets," he said, adding that this routine trimming of jobs here and there is the new normal — for now. Unsurprisingly, even with growth in some areas, the drip-drip of reductions in the past couple of years appears to be making some tech workers nervous. In a June survey from Indeed that involved more than 1,100 US tech workers, 40% of respondents said they expected to be affected if their company conducted layoffs. Seven in 10 said they'd start looking to other employers if their company laid off workers. Linsey Fagan, a senior talent strategy advisor at Indeed, told BI that most of the recurring layoffs were in tech. That's likely because many companies in the industry grew quickly during the pandemic and are still adjusting. But those recurring cuts don't come without costs, Fagan said. "It's definitely not a sustainable strategy," she added. Fagan said employee sentiment starts to drop before a layoff as workers suspect cuts are coming. After the layoffs, workers' feelings about the company — and a CEO's acumen — take "a long-term dive," she said. "When you look at a business trying to come back from that — if they're continuously laying off, it simply can't happen," Fagan said. Even smaller-scale layoffs can make workers jittery, she said. Fagan added that the rise of technologies like generative AI and the threat of layoffs were pushing many in tech to build their skills. Tech workers looking for jobs on Indeed, she said, are now more likely to apply to staffing firms, which might offer temporary gigs, or to roles in areas like healthcare than to tech firms. Fagan said that while some tech workers are drawn to the flexibility that contingent or part-time roles can offer, tech has historically been the No. 1 industry tech workers want to work in. "They're just not feeling that stability right now," Fagan said. Some companies' penchant for regular nips and tucks could be a result of Wall Street's celebration of that type of trimming. At Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was "beautifully rewarded" by the market for making cuts, Zeile said, noting a rise in the company's stock price. Beyond what investors might cheer, the tech giants are getting older and no longer in growth mode, when their aim was often to snap up workers. Hence, many companies made cuts following the rush of hiring during the pandemic. Since then, some bosses have been looking to trim the size of their organization and otherwise make improvements. Zuckerberg famously declared that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency." He also said the directive would become a feature, not a bug. Zeile predicted that investors would eventually look to tech companies to do more than boost profits by trimming costs and would want to see a return to growth. He said hiring would pick up broadly as companies find they have many areas in need of workers. A company like Meta might be cutting in some areas, but it's growing elsewhere, Zeile said. "Meta is actually on a tear right now," he said. "They're just no longer hiring VR engineers. They are hiring AI engineers, so they've actually boosted their hiring." Fagan said a sign that the tech industry might be closer to stabilizing was that, after declining for several years, job postings in areas like software development had remained flat in recent months, though they're still 30% below 2020 levels. Of course, that means there are fewer opportunities for laid-off workers. Still, she said, it's an indication that companies are being careful not to hire too many people. "It's not like they're going out and massively hiring and then doing layoffs," Fagan said. Welfle, who was laid off from Microsoft, wrote on LinkedIn that he was looking for a content-design role — maybe with a smaller company. He also said some of his feelings were similar to those he experienced after his layoff in December. "I'm having a hard time disentangling my sense of value and self-worth from my identity as a corporate worker," he said. "But I'll definitely be reflecting on that, and finding gentler, more sustainable ways to exist in a capitalist society."

Title: Learning to love nuclear power
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/learning-to-love-nuclear-power/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T09:42:39Z
Full Content:
Good morning. It’s been an encouraging week for fans of nuclear power. Amazon announced investments in three “innovative nuclear energy projects,” alongside Citadel’s Ken Griffin, that should deliver five gigawatts of zero-carbon energy over the next 15 years. Google announced a partnership with Kairos Power, which it described as “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors.” And that’s just this week. Microsoft last month announced a partnership with the energy firm Constellation to reopen a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island—yes, that Three Mile Island—to come online in 2028. Why the sudden nuclear renaissance? The energy needed to power data centers for AI is one reason. The need to reduce carbon emissions amid climate change is another. Public support for nuclear energy has been growing in recent years. While nuclear power is clean, nuclear fission, the process to produce it, uses radioactive materials that can cause deadly levels of radiation if released into the environment in an accident. I recently spoke with Patti Poppe, the CEO of California’s Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for the Leadership Next podcast that’s sponsored by Deloitte, which also supports this newsletter. Poppe has been focused on turning around the company’s operations, safety record, and culture, after PG&E’s culpability in the 2018 Camp wildfire put the utility into bankruptcy. Poppe believes the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is “an important part of the mix.” “The conversation has changed globally and here in the United States,” says Poppe. ‘I think the nation has realized that we can operate nuclear units safely, that, yes, it was scary in the seventies, but that is a long time ago. And we have realized that there are ways, just like with wildfire prevention, where we have a risk mitigation system in place at our nuclear power plant where we can fail safely.” What’s different is the emergence of small modular reactors or SMRs. Although versions have been around for years, the U.S. government and private corporations began making serious investments in developing them over the past decade. With their smaller and more flexible size, they can be quickly scaled up and adapted to a range of needs. But none are yet online in the U.S. and will need to clear regulatory approval. Bob Nardelli, the former Chrysler and Home Depot CEO, understands the landscape from his days at GE Power. Through his private-equity investment firm, X-LR8, Nardelli is now invested in BWX Technologies (BWXT), which makes a range of nuclear components and services. “I think it’s the solution for the future,” says Nardelli. “You don’t get line sag (sudden voltage drops), distribution loss, fires due to lightning hitting electrical lines and the life cycle is extradordinary.” More news below.

Title: Vice Bosses Talk Next Steps Following Bankruptcy And Tease New Production Finance Facility That Will Make It A “One-Stop Studio Shop”
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/10/vice-business-model-production-finance-facility-1236117304/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T18:27:52Z
Full Content:
By Diana Lodderhose International Features Editor EXCLUSIVE: This year has seen a swath of global production and distribution entities in film and television impacted by layoffs and cuts, and Vice Media Group has been no exception. Following the company’s much-publicized bankruptcy in 2022, when it was sold for $350 million to hedge fund and former investor Fortress, the group underwent a raft of layoffs and restructuring earlier this year, with its production business, Vice Studios Group, now being led by Jamie Hall in London and Danny Gabai in Los Angeles. But Hollywood loves a comeback, and Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon tells Deadline in a rare interview that Vice is back from the brink in a smaller capacity but with a clear vision and money to spend — the latter in the form of an imminent production finance facility, which it hopes to launch before the year end. Watch on Deadline “There’s no doubt that the business is far healthier than it was a year ago,” says Dixon. “One of the things I want to focus on is obviously culture and morale – it’s a tough industry to be in at the moment but we’re feeling positive because we have become a far more agile company.” The Vice chief says he expects the company to be in profit in Q1 2025. “We’re smaller, we take opportunities where we can now and, more importantly, we’re backed by our investors and our board in terms of looking for opportunities for growth and exciting projects.” Today, the company is operating at 30% of its size compared to the beginning of the year. Dixon says this leaner operation – and particularly its global production entity Vice Studios Group, which is behind projects such as Gangs of London, the Saoirse Ronan feature film Bad Apples, Netflix doc Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now and upcoming hybrid musical/doc Pavements – means it can better adapt to the changing market. Key to this, Dixon says, will be the introduction of a production finance facility, which it is currently at the “advanced stages” of securing. The London-based exec says he was recently in LA working on securing the production facility which will, he says, help propel the company’s strategy to move its studio business into a “more IP-based” content business and will enable it to be a “one-stop studio shop.” “We were forced to be a camera for hire for so long and that had more to do with our corporate resources than anything else,” says Dixon. “So, being able to break through what we went through in a much-publicized bankruptcy, we’re now focusing on the positives of being in the content business.” He continues: “We’re recognizing that we’ve always had that skillset, but we’ve just never had the financial capability to go out and be the super studio – which we have all the skills for, but we’ve never been able to put something up front on projects and get involved at earlier stages. That’s somewhat hindered us. It hasn’t hindered our creativity, but it’s hindered our output and our ability to improve margins and be a more successful financial business.” Vice Studios Group co-president Gabai notes that with streaming services and many premium cablers “moving away from a world where they do all-rights buyouts,” the introduction of a facility will better enable Vice to compete on a global scale for content via co-financing agreements or co-productions. “We do so much global production in the UK and other territories that, for us, it feels like there are more opportunities for windowing,” he says. “There’s an opportunity for a studio player out there who can really step into that role and fill the gap on productions that may be launching out of the UK, or other territories, and we can give them that extra piece of resource that they would need to go into production.” While Dixon couldn’t reveal any more details about numbers or timing on the finance facility, he did indicate that he was hopeful it will launch “before the end of the year.” “It’s something that is a priority for us and we hope to close it soon,” he says. “But it will allow us to have more possibilities as a company and allows us to be a little more opportunistic in our ideas, while also bringing more certainty around the projects we are doing.” Vice Media Group, which moved out of the online news game earlier this year, has trimmed down to focus on its Virtue ad agency and Vice TV, a joint venture with A&E, in addition to its studio business. Meanwhile, Vice Digital, a culture hub publishing content on and around Vice’s platforms, which Dixon notes was a “massive financial burden for us,” has since relaunched under a new joint venture with Nashville-based Savage Ventures. In the company’s tumultuous 18 months, one bright spot has been its global production business Vice Studios Group, which has a distribution catalogue of more than 1,000 hours and oversees five premium production entities: Pulse Films, UnTypical, Vice Studios LatAm, Vice Studios Canada and a news documentary unit. By the end of 2024, the group expects to have produced 21 projects including Pulse Films-produced Pavements, from director Alex Ross Perry, and Sky Original and Pulse Films series Atomic, starring Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif, the latter of which wrapped in Morocco last summer. The company is currently shooting the third season of British crime drama Gangs of London (seasons 1 & 2 launched on Netflix in September as part of a wide-ranging deal with AMC Networks) and also premiered Jason Pollard-directed doc Ol’Dirty Bastard: A Tale of Two Dirtys at the UK’s Doc’n Roll Film Festival. Vice Studios and Viral Nation recently announced the development of unscripted series Montana Boyz (working title), about TikTok cowboys Kaleb Winterbrun, Mark Estes and Kade Wilcox. “This will be the largest production year we’ve ever had, which is crazy when we are coming out of a bankruptcy,” says Gabai. “We’ve had this happen with all of the headwinds going on around us and a really tough marketplace, but now those headwinds are behind us.” Gabai notes that he and fellow Co-President Hall had previously restructured the studio business when Vice Studios and Pulse merged a few years prior to the bankruptcy. “I think, to some extent, the studio has been operating with the benefit of a very tightly knit group of people for a couple of years,” he says. The manifesto for the studios business is to focus on director-driven talent: “We tend to work with really great filmmakers and, oftentimes, if they’re not already huge household names when we start working with them, they tend to grow into big names off the back of doing projects with us.” This year, Vice reunited with its Fyre documentary director Chris Smith for Devo, a doc about the band of the same name which launched in Sundance earlier this year. It is also producing Hollywood Ending, from Tiger King director Rebecca Chaiklin, via its UnTypical strand, which follows the downfall of Zach Horwitz, the charismatic “midwestern, millennial Madoff” who ran a $690M Ponzi scheme under the noses of those closest to him. The latter was picked up by Amazon MGM. “I used to say in my agent days that talented people are always talented,” says Gabai. “Whether somebody’s having a hot moment or a cold moment or they’re making a million things at once, or they haven’t worked for a couple of years – if someone is really talented and attacks their projects in an interesting way, that’s somebody we want to bet on.” It was this vision that ultimately led Vice Studios to bringing aboard Listen Up Philip director Ross Perry to helm Pavements, a documentary/fiction hybrid about the venerable U.S. indie rock band Pavement fronted by Stephen Malkmus. Pavement is best known for songs such as “Cut Your Hair” and “Stereo,” which they released through Matador Records. The Pulse Films-produced project, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and is having its UK premiere at the London Film Festival today, intimately shows the band preparing for their sold-out 2022 reunion tour, while simultaneously taking the audience behind the scenes of the making of a musical, a museum and a spoof Hollywood biopic, featuring Jason Schwarzman as Matador Records founder Chris Lombardi and Joe Keery as Malkmus. Matador Records and Pavement were keen to do something “totally different” says Gabai, and he says that “this felt like a good opportunity to take the piss out of a standard music documentary.” “Alex was the top director on my list and Stephen seems like the character that Alex would have written about and created,” says Gabai. For Ross Perry, he was drawn to the “big, structural conceit of the film: “I just thought this movie should take place in a world where Pavement are as worthy of every form of tribute as say, the Rolling Stones, The Beatles or David Bowie because, for a few 100,000 people, that’s true,” he says. “In the spirit of the band, we wanted to put this whole endeavor in quotation marks, in the way they put the idea of being a successful band in quotations.” Pavements, says Gabai, is a prime example of the kinds of projects Vice Studios will aim to back going forward. “It’s always filmmaker first for us. Everything we do is driven by the filmmaker or the showrunner or the core creative on any project, what they want to do with the material on that project and what they want to say about this crazy world that we live in while doing it in a way that is fun and entertaining.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: From Tariffs to Taxes to Tyranny, Hollywood Braces for the Possibility of a Donald Trump Victory

Director Ali Abbasi basked in the applause, confident that the eight-minute standing ovation “The Apprentice” was enjoying in Cannes last May meant that his six-year gamble to bring the film to the screen was about to pay off. The movie, a look at Donald Trump’s early years as a real estate developer and his friendship with Roy Cohn, was scouting for distribution. Armed with this kind of reception, Abbasi believed he would soon have Netflix, or one of the prominent indie studios, knocking on his door. But though “The Apprentice” drew interest from the usual suspects, there were no offers — not even a lowball one. The film, which depicts Trump getting liposuction, abusing amphetamines, running his casino into the ground and raping his first wife, Ivana, was simply too hot to handle. With Trump locked in a tight race for the White House, major studios, indie labels and streamers, or at least their corporate parents, couldn’t risk alienating the once and possibly future king. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Hacks’ Post-Emmys Boost Highlights Max’s HBO Problem Melania Trump's Memoir Reveals She Flirted With Donald While He Was With Another Woman and Denounces Violent Jan. 6 Protesters “I get it,” Abbasi says. “This guy can become the next president, and he will have all these tools at his disposal, which he’s shown a willingness to use. So he can come after you with all these regulations and taxes.” he adds, “But it still upsets me.” Popular on Variety Abbasi’s experience says a lot about the anxiety gripping the entertainment world as it watches a tumultuous, enormously consequential election unfold. From corporate suites to studio lots, Hollywood is bracing for a possible Trump return, one that could bring chaos and deepen political divisions in a polarized country. “There’s a lot of nervousness,” says Schuyler M. Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker, who practices entertainment, corporate and tax law. “They don’t know exactly what he would do if he got back in power.” The actors, writers and directors who make most of what Hollywood exports are overwhelmingly supportive of Kamala Harris and view Trump as an existential threat to their freedoms. They speak at rallies for the Democratic nominee, host fundraisers and make personal contributions. And they’re terrified about what Trump would mean for everything from abortion access to environmental protections — to say nothing of the frontal assault on the rule of law he seems hell-bent on waging. “Everything’s at stake,” says Sarah Paulson, the Emmy- and Tony-winning actress and a Harris supporter. “Democracy is on the ballot.” But the people who sign Paulson and other artists’ checks have complicated loyalties — they seem more worried about making money than maintaining democratic norms. For them, a second Trump term would mean lower taxes and less antitrust enforcement, a key attraction for a debt-ridden industry looking to consolidate. They are banking on Trump behaving like a generic Republican by embracing a pro-business agenda. But Trump has been less interested in ideology and more attracted to a politics of personal grievance, one that rewards sycophants and punishes critics. Trump’s erratic behavior in his first term made it difficult for companies to figure out how to navigate his administration without offending him. Despite that challenge, his policies were often good for corporate bottom lines. In 2017, Trump signed a massive tax cut, lowering corporate rates from 35% to 21%. The bill included benefits that were especially helpful to Hollywood, including a lowered rate on overseas income and the ability to immediately write off the full cost of film and TV productions. Disney and Comcast each saved more than $6 billion in the following four years, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. If elected to a second term, Trump has vowed to cut the corporate rate even further — to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. Harris, in contrast, wants to hike the rate to 28% and increase the tax on overseas income. Regardless of who wins, the Motion Picture Association, which represents seven Hollywood studios, is already seeking to influence the next tax law. In a Sept. 25 letter, the lobbying group urged Congress to preserve the benefits of the Trump tax cut, arguing that it “led to a profound increase in film and television production and ownership in the U.S.” On the other hand, Trump has targeted companies that own news operations, sometimes in performative ways, but sometimes with genuine consequences. In the last month, he has threatened to pull the broadcast licenses of CBS and Disney’s ABC over their coverage, and he is currently suing ABC. He has threatened to investigate Comcast for “treason” over NBC’s coverage of the Russia scandal. And in 2017, his Justice Department sued to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, which some saw as retaliation against CNN for its coverage of his campaign and presidency. Looking ahead, Trump has pledged to use his office to prosecute opponents. Since many media conglomerates operate news divisions and produce late-night shows that investigate, criticize or lampoon Trump, that could make them a legal and political target for a president obsessed with personal retribution. “I could see him asking Republicans to pass a law saying anything anti-government is treasonous,” says Moore. “And I could also see him trying to upend current defamation law, so it becomes much easier to go after people. That could have a chilling effect on free speech.” Moore faults companies for being too enamored of the tax cuts that Trump is proposing and insufficiently fearful of his authoritarian impulses. “He’s not kidding around,” he says. “I’m not sure how great it would be for them to live in a country without a functional democracy.” Those darker predictions may not come to pass, but whoever wins the Oval Office will have to deal with a media industry that’s desperate to keep merging. And since the next president’s administration will be tasked with enforcing antitrust law, that will give either Trump or Harris enormous power over Hollywood’s future. The Biden administration has antagonized Wall Street by appointing enforcers — Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, anti-trust division chief at the Justice Department — who have targeted corporate power, especially in tech. Critics argue that has had a chilling effect. “They created an environment that made dealmaking more difficult,” says Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. “They’ve scared away deals.” It’s not obvious which administration would be better for companies. Kovacic assumes that Trump would back off on the Biden approach, though he adds, “if you’re a company he hates, he’s not beyond revenge.” Harris, meanwhile, sued several companies on antitrust grounds when she was California attorney general. But she was reluctant to take big swings at the tech industry, according to a memoir by Kathleen Foote, the longtime chief of the AG’s antitrust section. Kovacic says Harris might go a little easier than Biden, but in a subtle way, so as not to rile her left flank. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently urged the Justice Department to scrutinize Venu, the new sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, saying it would raise subscription prices across the industry. If Harris is elected, Sanders and Warren are likely to keep up the pressure on her administration on that and similar issues. Warner Bros. Discovery is struggling under a massive debt load, and another merger may be its only means of survival. At the Allen & Co. conference in July, CEO David Zaslav didn’t endorse a candidate, but said he hoped the next administration will see the benefits of consolidation. “We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,” he said. The Hollywood unions have supported the Biden approach, arguing that media consolidation suppresses wages and results in layoffs. “The Biden administration has been the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” says Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 65,000 Hollywood workers and has endorsed Harris. “It was an easy call for us,” Loeb says. Entertainment companies also face the risk of an all-out trade war. Hollywood is an export business, but many studios belong to companies such as Sony and Apple that also import electronics and other goods to the U.S. Trump has promised a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods coming from China. That would unleash “chaos” in a global marketplace, says Ed Brzytwa, the VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. “All the agreements, rules and norms will start to unravel,” he says. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, most of which Biden retained. They amounted to a $32 billion levy on electronic goods through 2021, according to Brzytwa’s group. The Consumer Technology Association — whose members include Sony, Disney, Amazon and Comcast — argues that the tariffs failed to revive U.S. manufacturing, but did push production to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and Taiwan. In 2022, Sony Electronics moved much of its camera production to Thailand. Harris would likely maintain the Biden approach, using targeted tariffs more aggressively than under previous Democratic administrations. Trump’s overall tariff rates would be seven times higher than the current level, according to the Tax Foundation. If he follows through, prices would rise, and the resulting drop in demand, for many companies, would outweigh any gains from lower tax rates, Brzytwa says. “I think there is a lot of interest in the corporate world in preserving what was accomplished in the [Trump tax bill],” he says. “But they don’t want a situation where the U.S. is a fortress and is closed off from the world.” Brzytwa warns that other countries would likely retaliate, making life more difficult for exporters — even entertainment producers. Media giants shoot all over the world, taking advantage of foreign subsidies. They employ creative talent overseas, and release movies and television shows to vast international regions, where they hope to drive future growth. Trump’s protectionist policies could disrupt that. They would threaten to reframe America’s role in the global economy, straining alliances and fracturing trade partnerships. The consequences of those actions would be felt in almost every sector of the economy. “You have someone in Trump with the potential to blow it all up,” says Tina Fordham, the founder of Fordham Global Foresight and an expert on geopolitical risk. “If the rules of the game and international norms aren’t respected, then the U.S. will no longer be treated as a reliable global trading partner. That means all the advantages that America has enjoyed in the post-World War II era could erode. I’m not sure people appreciate how destabilizing this could be.” Some of that impact is already being felt. A decade ago, Hollywood was still focused on opening the Chinese market to American films. But that initiative faded away as the relationship soured. “That ship has sailed,” says Greg Frazier, who worked on the issue while at the MPA. “Whether it’s Harris or Trump, I don’t see any great opening in China, on either side.” As for “The Apprentice,” after months in limbo, the producers finally signed a deal with Briarcliff Entertainment, a tiny distribution company that has handled politically charged fare such as “The Dissident,” a 2020 documentary about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that also scared off major media outlets. “It was such a relief to get into theaters,” Abbasi says. “I spent the summer clinically depressed and thinking, ‘We did all this work, and nobody is ever going to see our film.’” Instead, “The Apprentice” opened in theaters on Oct. 11, a month before a presidential election that could return Trump to the pinnacle of power. Abbasi is glad that someone had the courage to release his movie, but he won’t forget the fear he encountered while trying to get “The Apprentice” in front of audiences. “The big story for me is how one human being is intimidating the 300 million or so people who live in America,” Abbasi says. “How can an entire country let that happen?” Jack Dunn contributed to this report.

Title: Walmart’s CTO places bigger bets on generative AI as customer shopping habits evolve

Time Published: 2024-10-16T18:23:38Z

Over a few decades, consumers have moved from shopping exclusively in brick-and-mortar stores, to online, and more recently to spending billions annually through mobile apps. Now, consumers are changing their shopping habits again. Walmart calls the new reality “adaptive retail,” which is more about personalized shopping, an expectation that retailers will anticipate what consumers want before they decide themselves, and shoppers buying specific products based on what they see influencers pitching on social media. This evolution of consumer thinking has led Walmart to invest in newer technologies, including generative artificial intelligence. “Shopping is not just a blend of core retail and e-commerce,” says Hari Vasudev, executive vice president and chief technology officer of Walmart U.S. “It’s really a much more fluid experience.” As Walmart sees it, online shopping has been narrowly focused. Consumers would enter a few search terms to find the exact television or jeans they were looking for. Online retailers were tasked with selling goods at a desirable price and offering efficient and speedy delivery. But shoppers are getting more loquacious. They’re asking more detailed questions about products, and they want to use new tools, including 3D that can visualize furniture in their home, for example. According to Walmart, they also increasingly want to shop with the help of virtual reality to see what clothes they want to buy look like. Meanwhile, social channels like TikTok and live streaming services including Twitch provide inspiration for shopping. “The search bar is no longer the way to shop,” says Vasudev. That’s led Walmart to pivot by announcing this month that it’s starting to use predictive models and generative AI to offer a personalized version of walmart.com for every American shopper. The feature will fully roll out by the end of next year. “The way we’re thinking about applying AI and generative AI is to offer highly curated experiences and content,” says Vasudev. The goal is to create a personalized experience for each shopper based on what they’ve bought previously or searched for online, matched with what’s been a strong seller for Walmart or trending on social. Location and time of year would also factor in. A shopper who’s previously bought goods for their dog will be shown pet costumes for Halloween. Customers in Minnesota and Arkansas will be marketed new sweaters at different points in the season, based on when winter hits. Walmart’s generative AI efforts have thus far focused on five areas: the customer shopping experience, improving how in-store associates do their work, operational areas like supply chain and merchandising, content generation, and making software developers more productive. AI-focused tools Walmart has launched in the last few years to help employees save time have included “Ask Sam,” which lets associates ask questions like where to find a specific item in a store, and MyAssistant, a tool for corporate employees that can summarize large documents and write drafts. In most instances, Walmart is favoring “build” over “buy” when it comes to generative AI. The company centralized machine learning capabilities in a proprietary platform, called Element, so tech staff could experiment with AI models without having to worry if they would fit into a specific vendor or cloud provider. Walmart is using a blend of in-house large language models, proprietary offerings from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, and open-source models. This month, Walmart also unveiled a generative AI-powered customer support assistant that relies on retail-specific large language models. The generative AI, Walmart says, will enable the chatbot to anticipate customer questions and offer more proactive solutions for handling returns, exchanges, and other problems that may arise. And in some cases, the new AI agents are proving to be twice as fast as the humans, according to Vasudev. Throughout the development process, Walmart says finding the right conversational tone was critical. “When we have something like a chat experience, you want to make sure that the quality of the conversation feels empathetic and feels very genuine,” says Vasudev. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Adobe gets more creative on AI pricing. Adobe says the company’s new video-generating AI product will be priced differently than other AI tools, with CEO Shantanu Narayen acknowledging that the cost to produce video is “a little bit more expensive.” It's the latest indication that tech firms are tinkering with their approach to pricing while also racing to develop and launch new AI products. Bloomberg reports that until now, Adobe hasn't charged for the use of the software company’s AI features beyond standard subscription fees. And while users are allotted certain credits for using AI, Adobe isn’t enforcing those limits for most plans. Amazon, Databricks ink AI chips deal. Amazon.com and Databricks have agreed to a five-year deal that will let the startup use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips to power a service that would let companies customize an AI model, or even build their own. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal will let Amazon continue to position itself as a neutral provider of AI technology, while Databricks makes money from cloud-based AI software and other services from companies building their technology tools. Databricks and Amazon already work together, as Amazon Web Services is one of Databricks’ cloud partners, and Databricks also rents Nvidia’s graphics processing units through AWS. TikTok, Boeing announce layoffs for very different reasons. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, said the social media platform is laying off 500 employees, most of whom moderated content on the service. TikTok says that 80% of content that violates the company’s guidelines is already removed by automated technologies, but the latest cut is an even greater shift to using AI for content policing. Separately, Boeing is cutting 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 employees. The aerospace company also announced it would end production in 2027 of the 767 freighter, which has faced setbacks for years related to questions about the company’s quality control and safety precautions. Tesla’s robotics and AI event disappoints; CIO departs. Tesla’s Cybercab event, aimed at persuading investors that the electric vehicle maker is also a leader in AI and robotics, failed to impress Wall Street. Much of the criticism fell on CEO Elon Musk for failing to share any specifics about the timeline or operational rollout of the self-driving Cybercab. Meanwhile, Bloomberg and other outlets reported that humans were remotely controlling some capabilities of the Optimus robot prototypes that had initially made a splash online when they were unveiled last week. Ahead of the event, Bloomberg also reported that Nagesh Saldi, Tesla’s chief information officer, is leaving the company. Saldi had reported directly to Musk and had been involved in building out new data centers in Texas and New York. Increased efficiency is a top genAI aspiration. Executives surveyed by MIT Technology Review Insights, along with business technology provider Snowflake, found that 72% were prioritizing increased efficiency and productivity from their generative AI efforts, far exceeding their hope for increased revenue (30%) or reducing costs (24%). Increased market competitiveness ranked second at 55% in the survey, and product and services innovations and improved customer satisfaction were also seen as more valuable than boosting the top line or trimming expenses. The poll of around 275 business leaders also found that 53% say their data foundations were “somewhat ready” for gen AI, meaning their data has been properly gathered, aggregated, stored, and is accessible to support generative AI applications. Twenty-two percent were more confident, saying their data foundations are “very ready.” The remaining 25% felt either “somewhat” or “very” unready.

Title: How storytelling platform Pratilipi scripted a rare hit

Bengaluru: During the long hours of pandemic-induced lockdown, some of his friends picked up mobile gaming while others discovered short videos on YouTube and Instagram. But for Rohit Agarwal, a garment shop owner from Tumsar, a town in north-west Maharashtra, it was reading a college love story that sparked a new passion. Within weeks, Agarwal found himself spending hours every day engrossed in reading long-form fiction on Pratilipi, a digital storytelling platform. “There were days when I’d start a book post lunch and finish it by midnight," he recalls. New to reading, Agarwal was surprised to discover the addictive joy in captivating stories and the fictional world of romance and love stories. Soon, Agarwal took a plunge and decided to publish his own stories on the platform, a transition quite common on Pratilipi which has an active community of 1.5 million writers and 6.5 million monthly readers. The startup is a user-generated content platform that allows authors to publish their long-form content in multiple Indian languages. Founded in 2014 and backed by investors like Tencent, Nexus Ventures and Alteria Capital, Pratilipi recently reached a milestone of being cash-flow positive in July 2024. Pratilipi’s revenue in 2023-24 rose by 66% to ₹58 crore, from ₹35 crore the year before.The net loss narrowed by 62% to ₹58 crore last year. Overall, the company has raised $80 million in funding over seven rounds. But the company cannot be measured by its finances alone. In the era of 15-second reels and waning attention spans, Pratilipi’s quest to foster a culture of reading long-form regional literature stands out in India’s content ecosystem—an ecosystem that has seen a massive rise and crash in the last half-decade. Several short video apps that emerged in the last few years tanked while some like Moj, Josh and MXtakatak saw mergers. Popular live-streaming apps disappeared after the China ban, while Koo, an Indian version of Twitter (now X), shut shop earlier this year citing a lack of funding or acquisition interest. While these platforms spent heavily on customer acquisition and creator rewards, some failed to take off and others are still struggling to retain users and build sustainable communities. One of the reasons for Pratilipi’s survival in tough market conditions has been its singular focus on long-form content. While other platforms tried to cash in on the market frenzy of multiple formats like short videos and bite-sized content, Pratilipi stuck to its core offering of in-depth, engaging stories in regional Indian languages. This focused effort has helped the platform build a loyal fanbase of millions of readers—primarily women aged between 18-35 years. “Long-form storytelling will never go out of fashion," says Ranjeet Pratap Singh, founder of Pratilipi. Singh’s journey with Pratilipi is rooted in his conviction and confidence that good stories will always find consumers. That said, Pratilpi’s journey hasn’t always been smooth. Wattpad’s playbookBefore founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures. In 2014, when Pratilipi launched, Wattpad, the Toronto-based self-publishing platform, was already recognized among the hottest digital media companies. A rage among teen girls, Wattpad, in its eighth year of running, had attained a cult-like status and began monetization in 2014 after reaching 25 million monthly active users. Borrowing several pages from Wattpad’s playbook, Singh says he knew this was a game of patience and execution. View Full Image A screenshot of the Wattpad reading app. “Our first major challenge was to build demand and supply—a classic chicken and egg problem," says Singh. Pratilipi chose to focus on fixing the supply side first. The company reached out to authors through various channels, imploring them to get published on the platform. Writers such as Abhidha Sharma and Jitendra Jeetu were approached. Despite being published, these authors were having difficulty reaching a wide readership. To build an initial content library, the company also picked up a few hundred Indian language titles that were available in the public domain. This strategy, aped from Wattpad’s playbook, helped the company get the initial traction and readers. Eventually, though, the platform had to prove its merit in the original content market. Singh recalls placing a great emphasis on prioritizing its writers and their experience on the platform. Pratilipi introduced initiatives such as workshops for new writers, fellowships for seasoned authors, author chat rooms and a feedback loop between readers and writers. “One of our biggest initial platform challenges was supporting Indian languages," says Singh. Fortunately, the launch and adoption of the Google Indic keyboard took the load off a tech problem for the company. Pratilipi stories are currently available in 12 Indian languages, including Punjabi, Odia and Bengali. Malayalam and Marathi stories are read the most. View Full Image A screenshot from the Pratilipi app. The highest form of gratification for writers, though, comes from a large reader community. To fix this, the company aggressively marketed through Facebook ads. Authors were also encouraged to share their stories within their network. Community initiatives like chat rooms for authors helped build user retention. All these efforts made traditional book publishers sit up and take notice. “Pratilipi’s success in enabling online reading habits has been an eye-opener, changing the perception of traditional publishers," says Gautam Padmanabhan, chief executive of Westland Books, a company Pratilipi acqui-hired in April 2022 after Amazon announced that it was shutting down the publishing house.Acqui-hire is the practice of buying a company to access employees and their skills.“This has forced us to rethink our approach to digital publishing," Padmanabhan added. Early investors, meanwhile, believed in the monetization potential of the platform. Nexus Ventures was one of them. Pratik Poddar, partner at the venture capital firm, explains that their initial investment was driven by the founders’ passion for creating a literature-focused platform in India. However, the global trend of users paying for long-form content and the potential to monetize intellectual property, as seen in the West and China, solidified their decision to invest. Pay to readFor the longest time, the platform was free; authors weren’t paid. This changed in 2020 when Pratilipi introduced a premium app where subscriptions cost ₹150 a month or ₹1,500 a year. In addition, there is also a ‘Superfan’ subscription where readers can subscribe to specific authors for ₹25 a month or ₹250 a year. The app currently has 400,000 monthly paying users.Pratilipi authors now get paid based on engagement generated by paid users on the app, similar to Spotify. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model, where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and feedback. By default, writers own the intellectual property for any story they publish on the platform. However, the company also acquires a small number of stories that it feels can work across various formats such as audio and web series. Authors still retain a share of the revenue generated from these formats. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model,where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and allows authors to receive ongoing feedback on the plot twists and turns of their narratives. Shelja Shrivastava,who writes in Hindi, is among the top authors on Pratilipi. She recalls hiring an external editor to proofread and edit her story chapters. “I wasn’t getting paid for my stories back then, but I was willing to spend on an editor because I didn’t want to publish a shoddy story," says Shrivastava, adding that user feedback was paramount to her. View Full Image A file photo of Shelja Shrivastava. A part-time professor and homeopathic doctor, Shrivastava, on good days writes anywhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words over a couple of hours and makes about ₹35,000 per month through the platform. When she is not as active, her earnings drop to ₹20,000 a month. Popular among the genre of social issues and romance, Shrivastava has built a community of 30,000 followers and 27 million impressions on the platform. Time to buy2020 was also when the company pressed the accelerator on diversification. Inorganic growth was in the offing. Pratilipi expanded into audiobooks and comics. That year, it acquired IVM Podcasts, a podcast platform. Pratilipi FM, the company’s audiobook platform, now has 170,000 monthly active listeners, while Pratilipi Comics, which offers digital comics in six Indian languages, has over 80,000 monthly active readers. The Westland acqui-hire, meanwhile, gave the company expertise in physical publishing. And Westland gained from the digital publishing expertise Pratilipi built over the years. Since the partnership, Westland has adaptedThe Habit Coach, a podcast on the platform, into a book. It also adapted Ruskin Bond’sTales From My Heart into a comic book. Six months to liveFor Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses—the runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year—down to ₹6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. During this period, the revenue from Pratilipi’s literature segment remained strong, aiding the company to stay afloat and even grow. In January 2024, the literature segment became cash flow positive, marking a turning point. By July, Pratilipi achieved overall cash flow positivity. Nonetheless, Singh admits to making decisions that have hurt revenue growth. For instance, the Pratilipi app doesn’t have an erotica category—although there is plenty of romance—because many writers on the platform insisted on “keeping the platform family-friendly." The next chapterWhile erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books. Pratilipi wants to capitalize on this trend by expanding its intellectual property across various formats. This move positions them to better compete in the regional content market. The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ₹10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. “Great stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. “Our competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." Before founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures.

Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. “Great stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. “Our competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." For the longest time, the platform was free; authors weren’t paid. This changed in 2020 when Pratilipi introduced a premium app where subscriptions cost ₹150 a month or ₹1,500 a year. In addition, there is also a ‘Superfan’ subscription where readers can subscribe to specific authors for ₹25 a month or ₹250 a year. The app currently has 400,000 monthly paying users.Pratilipi authors now get paid based on engagement generated by paid users on the app, similar to Spotify. By default, writers own the intellectual property for any story they publish on the platform. However, the company also acquires a small number of stories that it feels can work across various formats such as audio and web series. Authors still retain a share of the revenue generated from these formats. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model,where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and allows authors to receive ongoing feedback on the plot twists and turns of their narratives. Shelja Shrivastava,who writes in Hindi, is among the top authors on Pratilipi. She recalls hiring an external editor to proofread and edit her story chapters. “I wasn’t getting paid for my stories back then, but I was willing to spend on an editor because I didn’t want to publish a shoddy story," says Shrivastava, adding that user feedback was paramount to her. A part-time professor and homeopathic doctor, Shrivastava, on good days writes anywhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words over a couple of hours and makes about ₹35,000 per month through the platform. When she is not as active, her earnings drop to ₹20,000 a month. Popular among the genre of social issues and romance, Shrivastava has built a community of 30,000 followers and 27 million impressions on the platform. Time to buy2020 was also when the company pressed the accelerator on diversification. Inorganic growth was in the offing. Pratilipi expanded into audiobooks and comics. That year, it acquired IVM Podcasts, a podcast platform. Pratilipi FM, the company’s audiobook platform, now has 170,000 monthly active listeners, while Pratilipi Comics, which offers digital comics in six Indian languages, has over 80,000 monthly active readers. The Westland acqui-hire, meanwhile, gave the company expertise in physical publishing. And Westland gained from the digital publishing expertise Pratilipi built over the years.

Six months to liveFor Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses—the runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year—down to ₹6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh.

The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ₹10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget.

Title: CVS and Walgreens are ailing. Here’s why
URL: https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:34:11Z

Alina Selyukh Walgreens said Tuesday it would close 1,200 stores. Rival drugstore chain CVS recently laid off thousands of employees to cut costs. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Not too long after Tim Wentworth became CEO of Walgreens, he revealed a stunning figure: Roughly a quarter of the pharmacy chain’s stores do not make money. On Tuesday, he said 1,200 of those stores will close over three years. That’s two weeks after rival CVS announced layoffs of 2,900 corporate staff. Both chains are on a multibillion-dollar cost-saving spree — closing hundreds of locations, cutting thousands of jobs and, really, reconsidering their role in Americans’ lives. The slow simmer of mistakes and misfortunes has come to a boil for the biggest U.S. drugstore chains. They’ve accumulated too many stores at a time of changing shopper habits. They’re saddled with numerous government fines and a particularly ailing relationship with health insurers. CVS and Walgreens have some notable differences. Walgreens, which also owns the British drugstore Boots, is more singularly focused on its pharmacy business. CVS has expanded further into health care through mergers with insurer Aetna and Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager that helps insurers negotiate prescription drug coverage and costs. Yet the two companies have made similar missteps. The simplest part of the problem is scale. CVS and Walgreens grew massive nationwide footprints of more than 9,000 and 8,000 stores, respectively. They gobbled up mom-and-pop shops and signed long-term leases for prime locations on street corners. A chain with a padlock secures freezer doors at a San Francisco Walgreens store in July 2023. The store padlocked its freezers to thwart shoplifters who had been stealing frozen pizzas and ice cream. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Now, shoppers regularly complain about chronically understaffed stores, with products locked up to prevent theft. The shelves of snacks, makeup, greeting cards and cleaning products were meant to boost profits. But sales have sagged for years — a result of a losing battle with Amazon, Walmart, Costco, grocery and dollar stores. CVS and Walgreens “probably do have too many stores because they overexpanded, but the bigger problem is that the stores that they have are not very good,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at the firm GlobalData. The chains have failed to add new incentives for shoppers, beyond photo booths and returns drop-off centers, says Anshuman Jaiswal, a longtime consultant to retailers and pharmacies. And neither chain has built a meaningful online presence designed to give customers what they need. “If you go to CVS.com or Walgreens.com, if you are placing an order for cough syrup, why don't I sell chicken broth as a product recommendation immediately?” Jaiswal says. “It's about reimagining the business model.” Given the retail struggles, pharmacies could perhaps simply ditch the convenience store and focus on selling medicine — except CVS and Walgreens say it’s harder and harder to make a profit from this part of their business. Years ago, a big shift in the power balance between pharmacies and health insurers revealed the limits of drugstores’ leverage. “Historically, there was a view that there was a lot of customer loyalty to their specific retail pharmacy … and that patients, or consumers, would be all up in arms if they were forced to move their prescriptions,” says Brian Tanquilut, health care services analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. Walgreens tested this theory about a decade ago when it got into a public fight with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that worked with major health insurers. Walgreens and Express Scripts played a game of chicken over how much Walgreens should earn from prescriptions — and Walgreens lost. For a time, it got kicked out of insurance networks used by millions of people, who simply went elsewhere to get their medicine at the lower in-network prices. “What that did was to prove that patient loyalty is not to the retail pharmacy, but it actually is whatever my insurance is willing to pay,” Tanquilut says. “And that opened the door for the payers to keep pushing pricing down on retail pharmacy chains.” These days, CVS and Walgreens are facing tough competition from pharmacies that don’t depend as much on profits from prescriptions because they’re part of retail giants, including Walmart and Costco. The drugstore chains also have spent millions of dollars on government fines over allegations of unsafe staffing levels, overbilling government insurance programs and contributing to the opioid epidemic. Over the years, CVS and Walgreens attempted to reframe themselves as health care hubs, expanding primary-care clinics. But these operations cost time and money. On Tuesday, Walgreens CEO Wentworth said his chain is “reorienting to its legacy strength as a retail pharmacy-led company.” CVS is reportedly weighing a breakup to undo its mergers with Aetna and Caremark. Both companies are also proposing new structures for how they want to be paid for filling prescriptions, hoping this is the big shot in the arm they need. "I'm very confident that over a two- to three-year period we will have reset the framework for reimbursement discussions," Wentworth told investors on Tuesday. “We are in the early stages of a turnaround that will take time.” Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: ‘Students are frustrated’: College seniors seeking tech jobs face a chilly hiring market
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/16/tech-industry-job-market-hiring-college-graduates/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:00:00Z

When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work. The signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting. “Students are frustrated,” Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley’s career center, tells Fortune. The unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective. So far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That’s on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year. Things won’t necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers. In a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That’s a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles. In response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today’s computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022. Of any college major, that’s the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake’s report notes. Another report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023. Overall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month. At Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps. “I’m seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,” Pitcher said. At Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers. “They’re still doing tech roles, but they’re doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,” Collins said. Carnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition’s list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley. And while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said. “It’s probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,” Collins said. Madeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she’d already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing. Searching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said. “You can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you’re at a fork in the road where you’re wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?” she said. Brutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley “pure tech” companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: New One Piece, Naruto Games Reportedly Canceled by Bandai Namco

Bandai Namco games involving One Piece, Naruto, and more are supposedly in jeopardy. By Tanner Dedmon Some unannounced games in the worlds of One Piece and Naruto have supposedly been either paused or canceled entirely amid some larger shakeups at Bandai Namco, according to new reports. It’s been suggested that work on these unknown games is uncertain at the moment due to a underwhelming demand, and the games in flux apparently extend beyond anime titles, too, with a Nintendo project currently on hold at Bandai Namco as well. News of the state of these Naruto and One Piece games supposedly in the works over at Bandai Namco comes from Bloomberg which said that the publisher had either halted or canceled some of its projects. Bloomberg speaks of a “lackluster demand,” though it seems the demand here is referring more to games in general as the gaming industry continues to cut costs by canceling projects and laying off workers. There were no references made to a lack of demand for Naruto and One Piece, specifically, which makes sense given that the latter is more popular than ever after Netflix’s live-action Naruto series even if the franchise is currently going on a hiatus. That does made it even stranger that Bandai Namco would be reconsidering a One Piece game, however, given its popularity and the fact that we’ve gotten several One Piece games in the last four years. Bandai Namco publishes tons of anime-themed games — pretty much any of the more modern ones that you can think of — so there’s no telling what kinds of games these One Piece and Naruto projects were. Many of Bandai Namco’s anime games are arena fighters like the wonderful Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero while others are a bit more open like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, but they all typically circle back around to beating up anime baddies. But while anime adaptations may be the publisher’s bread and butter, its work extends beyond that scope as well. Bandai Namco published Elden Ring and other Souls games, for example, and also works with Nintendo on some projects. Two Nintendo franchises Bandai Namco works on are the Mario Kart and Smash Bros. games with a broader team established recently to work closer with Nintendo (though those franchises were not specifically mentioned in the announcement). Mobile games are another focus of Bandai Namco which are also supposedly being impacted by these decisions made internally. Another game, Blue Protocol, was recently confirmed for a shutdown early next year despite having only just released recently. The Western version of the game which was to be published by Amazon has also been canned. As a result of these cancelations and paused games, Bandai Namco is also reducing its workforce with around 200 employees said to be affected. These employee losses also contribute to an already brutal year for gaming studios in terms of layoffs and lost talent.

Title: Walgreens Announces It Will Close 1,200 Stores Across US by 2027

Friends Read Free Pharmacy chain Walgreens announced it will shut down 1,200 stores across the United States over the next three years. Closures of Walgreens stores were announced in June, but the company had not disclosed the number of affected stores at that time. It had more than 8,000 stores in the United States as of Aug. 31 last year. “Our financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 reflected our disciplined execution on cost management, working capital initiatives and capex reduction,” Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in the statement. He said that in the next fiscal year, Walgreens will be “focusing on stabilizing the retail pharmacy by optimizing [the company’s] footprint, controlling operating costs, improving cash flow, and continuing to address reimbursement models to support dispensing margins and preserve patient access for the future.” “This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,” said Wentworth, who was named chief executive officer in 2023. Walgreens, like its competitors, has been struggling for years with tight reimbursement for the prescriptions it sells as well as other challenges such as rising costs to operate its stores. Drugstore chains have also been dealing with more competition from online retail giant Amazon, as well as Walmart and Target. Rival CVS Health Corp. is wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 stores. Another major chain, Rite Aid Corp., emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization earlier this year after whittling its store count down to about 1,300 locations. Walgreens has also been backing away from a plan to add primary care clinics next to some of its stores after launching an aggressive expansion under previous CEO Rosalind Brewer. Walgreens said Tuesday that its net loss swelled to more than $3 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company said softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance hurt operating income. It also booked some hefty charges tied to opioid litigation settlements the company had recognized in previous quarters and an equity investment in China. Walgreens shares rose by almost 4 percent on Tuesday morning before Wall Street’s opening bell. Earlier in October, CVS said it was cutting about 2,900 jobs across the United States as part of a cost-savings program, according to a statement. Those layoffs will mainly impact corporate jobs and will represent fewer than 1 percent of the company’s workforce. The reductions, part of CVS’s previously announced plan, would primarily impact corporate roles and not frontline jobs in stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers, it said.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Japanese video game developer seems to be the latest company not immune to undergoing layoffs and shuttering projects. By Lan Pitts on October 15, 2024 at 9:25AM PDT In a year flush with video-game-company layoffs and restructuring, Bandai Namco has reportedly canceled several titles including games featuring One Piece and Naruto licenses. In addition to those games, there was reportedly an unnamed contract project with Nintendo that has been shuttered as well. In a report by Bloomberg, coinciding with the projects being terminated, it's stated that the company is taking a traditional "Japanese approach to reduce staff and sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily” so they don't receive any form of severance. The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge." Over the summer, the company further shuttered its long-running Tales of the Rays mobile game and said it would take down its MMO game Blue Protoco starting in January. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol," Bandai Namco said in a statement. "Both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world." Bandai Namcon's latest release, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero saw strong initial sales. The game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, sold more than 3 million units worldwide within its first 24 hours after its launch. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: Walgreens is closing 1,200 stores over the next two years

Walgreens is closing more locations. Walgreens is closing approximately 1,200 locations as the drug store chain struggles to contend with online competitors and declining prescription drug payments. By 2027, about one in seven Walgreens currently open will close its doors. About 500 Walgreens will close its doors over the next year, the drug store chain announced Tuesday. Those closures represent a significant escalation from a few months ago, when the financially struggling company announced in June it was shutting 300 underperforming locations as part of a multi-year optimization program under CEO Tim Wentworth. At the time, the company had said about a quarter of Walgreens stores were unprofitable, and the chain promised "imminent" changes. Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts. Major drugstore chains, including CVS and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They've declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term." For Saunders, Walgreens' eliminating the "dead wood will help the company strengthen its financials over time, but it is a huge admission of failure."

Title: Taking voluntary redundancy or getting laid off? You need to know about your tax, welfare and pension options
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/10/15/taking-voluntary-redundancy-or-getting-laid-off-you-need-a-financial-plan-for-the-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T05:00:00Z

Redundancies are common these days. Tech, pharma, finance and consulting workers know the wind can change at brutal speed. You’re sipping your free wellness smoothie one minute and out the door the next. When redundancy is in the ether, it’s good to have a financial plan. Drug giant Pfizer is the latest multinational to announce job cuts here. Some 210 of its workers will go over the next year. TikTok, Wayfair and Flutter announced cuts earlier this year. It was Accenture before that, with 890 redundancies announced last year. This followed cuts at Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Stripe and Amazon. There was a snap cost-cutting cull at Twitter too, with 50 per cent of its Dublin office gone. Those are just the ones that made headlines. Derek Maguire, a financial planner with Financial Architects, gets about six to 10 enquiries a week from workers dealing with voluntary or compulsory redundancy. “The average person coming to us would be on about €100,000, maybe €120,000; they are typically aged 50-plus,” says Maguire. They are skilled and, with the country at near-full employment, they will get another job if they want it, he says. Nevertheless, the prospect of redundancy requires some financial reckoning. “The main questions people ask us are, ‘can I afford to take six months or a year off?’ I hear that all the time. They are flat out and they want a break,” Maguire says. Where there’s an offer of voluntary redundancy on the table, people are nervous of leaving a generous pension scheme. David Looney, a qualified financial planner with Alpha Wealth in Cork, has helped a lot of people dealing with redundancy this year. Most are skilled, well paid and will have the chance of moving to a similar role. “Sometimes it’s about giving them the reassurance that they are in a financial position that they can take a bit of time off,” says Looney. “Some are almost happy with redundancy. It can give them a financial cushion to take some time off work, to travel, pay off the mortgage, or spend time with the kids before taking up a similar role.” Both warn that it’s imperative that those dealing with redundancy don’t rely solely on canteen chats or a colleague’s WhatsApp group for financial advice. Your individual severance package, and your tax, pension and savings position will all shape what redundancy will mean for you. Everyone is different. “I remember a case where one person made the wrong decision about how to take redundancy, and eight colleagues followed them and did the same thing, so they all made the wrong decision,” Maguire says. A severance package might be broken down into three elements, says Looney. The first includes things like holidays you haven’t been paid for, or pay in lieu of a notice period. Maybe you have a bonus due, too. All of this goes through as a normal salary payment. If you are earning over €42,000, or €44,000 from next year, it’s going to be taxed at the top rate. “There’s not a whole lot you can do there, there are no tax-free exemptions,” says Looney. The second element is the statutory redundancy payment. This part is tax-free. Statutory redundancy is the minimum an employer must pay. It equates to two weeks’ gross pay for each year of your service, plus another one week gross pay. The weekly pay, however, is capped at €600. So whatever you earn, this will equate to €1,200 multiplied by your number of years of service, plus €600. The third element is an ex gratia redundancy payment. This is paid at your employer’s discretion. An ex gratia payment of six weeks’ pay per year of service as a lump sum would be typical, says Looney. Part of this ex gratia payment is tax-free and part can be taxable at your marginal tax rate. There are three ways to determine the tax-free part under Revenue rules. There is the basic exemption, the increased exemption and the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) – this is a tax relief that normally benefits people with higher earnings and long service. Your employer will typically crunch the numbers for you and the highest answer will determine how much of the ex gratia payment is tax-free, says Looney. There is another option you have. If, when calculating the tax-free part of your ex gratia payment, the increased exemption calculation or the SCSB is giving the highest tax-free payment, this can mean waiving your right to a future tax-free lump sum from the part of your pension pot related to that employment. “So, sometimes the employee has to tick option A to waive their right and take more of their redundancy payment tax-free now, or else tick option B and retain the right to take a tax-free lump sum from their pension on retirement and, in turn, take less of their redundancy payment tax-free now,” says Looney. [ Pension tax relief rises to cover pots of up to €2.8m by 2029 under Cabinet plansOpens in new window ] It’s a case of deciding, do I want more tax-free now or later? “Sometimes people automatically think, it’s best to get as much as I can tax-free now, but they can end up shooting themselves in the foot down the line, particularly if they have a fairly decent pension,” Looney says. He gives the example of a young tech worker who has built up a pension pot of €100,000. If this grew over 30 years, it would be worth more than €400,000 by the time they reach 60. At that point, they can usually take out 25 per cent as a tax-free lump sum, which is over €100,000. “That can be quite handy down the line for clearing your mortgage or wiping out any debts and basically helping set you up for retirement,” says Looney. Where the pension amount with your employer is small, however, it might make sense to waive the right to the retirement lump sum for that part of your pension and to take more tax-free now as it won’t have a big bearing on your pension, he says. It comes down to cash flow, too. If you don’t have savings and are concerned about being out of work for a long time, you may need to prioritise paying your mortgage. Some workers want to know if they can afford to take a less well-paid, but a less stressful job next, Maguire says. “I spoke to someone on over €120,000 who was asking if she can afford to take an €85,000 job next. She said, I’m killing myself here at the moment. I don’t want to be killing myself.” If you are due a fairly decent severance package, it can come with a big tax bill. One thing you can do to help minimise it is to make a last-minute pension contribution. This has to be done before you leave the company, says Looney. Once you leave an employer, you can’t make a backdated contribution. You could take some of your holiday pay, payment in lieu of notice, any bonus or potentially your severance payment and put that into your pension, says Looney. Your scope for pension contribution is dependent on your age. Someone in their 30s can contribute 20 per cent tax-free. “The whole amount would arrive in to their pension and have the potential of growing tax-free in to their retirement rather than it being taxed through the severance payment,” Looney says. When your role is made redundant, it can be tempting to pull up anchor with that employer entirely – but yanking out your pension pot may not be the best choice. “It can be advantageous to keep your pension pots separate, if you can draw them down at different points in time,” says Looney. “If you move it all into your new employer’s scheme, you might be restricting your fund options and also you may not be able to access your pension pot until you leave or retire from the company,” he says. When you lose your job, register with your local Intreo office or social welfare branch, even if you don’t qualify for an unemployment payment. You may be able to get credited PRSI contributions to avoid a break in your social insurance record. You may be entitled to a tax refund. Those with enough PRSI contributions should qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit. That’s a payment of up to €232 a week, paid for a maximum of nine months, after which you can reapply. There is a sliding scale as to when you can get your first payment. If your redundancy payment is €50,000 to €55,000, for example, you are disqualified from claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit for one week of the nine-month entitlement. Those getting a redundancy payment of €90,000 and over are disqualified for nine weeks. Older workers used to be the ones in the redundancy crosshairs. Some companies operated formulas, notes a company remuneration insider. One veteran tech employer operated the “75″ rule – if your age and your number of years’ service exceeded 75, your number was up. A financial institution operated a policy that if you were over 50 and on more than €50,000, it was time to go. Not all, but some staff looked forward to eventually meeting the criteria to get paid to go. Rolling redundancies are the operating model in many sectors now. “This year, we are seeing redundancy packages to a much younger cohort – within tech companies, for example,” Looney says. “We are dealing with people in their 20s and 30s getting redundancy packages.” As well as company metrics for employee wellness, there are metrics around salary and pension costs, too. When an employee becomes too expensive, says the insider, then comes redundancy. When a shareholder flaps its wings in Silicon Valley or China, it can mean a tornado for workers here. “Some are handpicked, they will get rid of the deadwood, and then they will look at costs. Are there people we can replace, perhaps for a lower salary and pension?” If you wonder why the average age in some companies never edges past 30, it’s not because the employees don’t age. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
