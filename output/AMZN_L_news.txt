EditorEconomy Kurt Schlichter, The Burning Platform Guest Post by Kurt Schlichter The Burning Platform In my January 1, 2024, column entitled “Top Twenty Terrible Predictions for 2024,” I noted that, “Every year, I offer you my predictions for the coming trip around the Sun, and every year, I’m mostly wrong.” Back then, I predicted that “I think [2024] will be a disaster.” Shows what I know. Personally, I had two houses flood from broken plumbing and practically became a general contractor. That sucked. But in the macro, it was a pretty good year for America. I predicted that “Trump is not going to be subject to any federal trials this year…. The state cases might, but they are idiotic too.” I also predicted that “the 14th Amendment nonsense is going to get shot down. I thought Hunter would plead out. As expected, Joe Biden was “not held accountable for his crimes.” Then there was this: “I really like Ron DeSantis, but there’s a significant chance that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee.” Oh, but then I ruined it by predicting that “if he is the nominee, he picks Nikki Haley and, for reasons I will set out in an upcoming Townhall column, that’s a good idea…from his perspective.” Boy, did that column stir the pot! I also correctly predicted that “she’ll continue to spew consultant-generated corporate-friendly cliches and hack talking points as she seeks to turn back the clock on Republicanism twenty years.” I predicted that “Israel is going to rout Hamas,” but also that “there will be some sort of talks to resolve the Ukraine open wound.” I was right that “the Houthis will continue to humiliate America and will be on the receiving end of a few puny airstrikes.” At home, I foresaw leftist riots. Those did not happen. I predicted that “the border crisis will continue unabated,” and Biden pretended to abate it a little bit. I also correctly saw that “the GOP squish caucus will enter into a compromise to solve it.” Senator Jim Amnesty Lankford makes an appearance in my “Biggest Idiots of 2024” column. I was right that we would win the Senate but wrong when I predicted that “we will lose the House because we are Republicans and Republicans are stupid.” In fact, we won it, barely, because Republicans are stupid. I was wrong when I predicted a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled by “a pinko BIPOC differently-abled nonbinary two-spirit of heft.” I was right when I predicted that wokeness would peak and begin to decline. I was right that “the women’s Olympic medals will all be won by men, proving that men are better than women at everything, including being women.” I was also right that “the Regime Media will suffer more layoffs and bankruptcies, and there will be much rejoicing.” I expected the football guy to dump Taylor Swift. I don’t know whether that happened or not. I was doing pretty well until I got here: “Joe Biden is not going to be replaced, and he will be on the ballot in November. I’m not sure if he’ll know it, though. Man, picking Kamala Harris was the greatest insurance policy anybody ever took out.” I further opined that “the Democrats will win in November.” In my defense, I said that hoping “my track record of being wrong about my predictions holds up.” It held up, thankfully. Here’s what I think will happen in 2025: Once again, see you in 12 months, assuming these idiots have not caused a nuclear and/or civil war in the meantime so that I can give you some more inevitably wrong predictions for 2026.

Title: The End Of Management? Gen Z Faces New Challenges In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/01/03/the-end-of-management-gen-z-faces-new-challenges-in-2025/

Gen Z faces the disappearance of management jobs in 2025. In 2025, it’s predicted that 1 in 10 management roles will be filled by Gen Z. But that’s a complicated statistic, when management jobs are going the way of the milk man and the fax machine. Forbes highlights the stark reality of white-collar job cuts, with middle-management positions being systematically eliminated at organizations like Google, Meta, UPS and others. Indeed, middle management positions accounted for nearly a third of layoffs in 2023, according to reports from Live Data Technologies. That’s bad news for Gen Z workers seeking guidance, mentoring and oversight. Or a white-collar job in management. Is management a disappearing career? CNBC reports that Amazon is shifting to an individual-contributor model - a type of unbossing that could foster the elimination of as many as 14,000 management roles. Other companies are making similar moves on a smaller scale, cutting into the middle to improve the bottom line. What’s really at work here? Is AI making middle management positions redundant? “Digital transformation plays a significant role,” according to Joseph Roh, a professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University who commented on the unbossing trend on CNBC. “Automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software.” While management is disappearing, employee engagement is suffering. Gallup notes that the connection between employees and managers is a driving force behind performance and employee wellbeing, stating that “the role of the manager has never been more important”. But is it really? The crisis for Gen Z isn’t that thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. The key takeaway here is that these jobs don’t really exist anymore. Is it any wonder that employee engagement is in the ditch, and Forbes reports that 52% of Gen Z workers don’t want to be middle managers? Self-leadership is the direction for Gen Z, but navigating without guidance might be the real challenge. In a Harris poll, 82% of managers said that Gen Z new hires need more training in soft skills. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of Gen Z employees say that these highly-desired soft skills can’t be taught, and can only be developed by watching more seasoned employees over time. A Catch-22 is the result of these mutually conflicting conditions. It’s the classic chicken and the egg paradox: how do you gain valuable experience without the opportunity to gain valuable experience? Or be managed by those who can share it? The Harris Poll revealed that over half of Gen Z employees feel underprepared for professional roles, citing a lack of soft-skill training during their formative years (read: COVID). How do you demonstrate what you have not observed, learned or experienced? Over half of Gen Z employees say that a lack of interpersonal training makes them afraid of “asking dumb questions”. According to the survey, nearly 60% of Gen Z employees don’t know who to turn to for help with their soft skills. Perhaps because their manager was recently fired? Linda Jingfang Cai, VP of talent development at LinkedIn, told Fortune that soft skills are “the currency of the future workplace”. She said that any company helmed by people who don’t prioritize empathy and connection will lose out on this vital currency. As AI further integrates itself into business operations, soft skills are becoming more significant in 2025. Think judgment, teamwork, and articulating a vision—even a vision for the next phase of AI. Coaching can augment unknowns, accelerate experience and provide a safe space for “dumb questions”. Here are three actionable ways coaching can help: For Gen Z, the workplace of 2025 is a crucible of opportunity and challenge - with more of the latter inhibiting the former. If engagement and performance are going to be a part of the future of work, individuals and organizations have to access new skills, now. Self-leadership has never been more important than it is now. That trend is only going to continue in the age of AI. Through a commitment to coaching and skill-building, Gen Z and employers can bridge the management gap - and be better prepared for the future of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Rivian stock surges to start the year on better-than-expected EV deliveries

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year. Rivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. After its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive. Even with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier. Rivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.” Rivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.

Title: Secret Level asked Microsoft about an awesome Halo and Doom crossover — "Crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood," but Microsoft said: "Nah."

An interview with the creators of Secret Level revealed how crossover episode pitches to id Software and Microsoft fell flat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I still remember when I first heard about Xbox making a Halo TV show. I'm not reminiscing about when the Paramount TV show was announced, but when they first mentioned that Steven Spielberg would be directing it in 2013. An entire decade before. It was around the time of the Xbox One announcement and launch. The Halo TV show was part of the whole "all your entertainment in a single box" push. It was meant to usher in a new age at Microsoft, one that focused on programming and content for the customer. After years of hearing, "Don't worry, the Halo show is still coming," we were finally blinded by Master Cheeks. Halo fans around the globe held their gaming controllers, hoping for a cinematic Master Piece. What they received was a show that not only missed the spirit of the franchise but somehow failed to even make a decent sci-fi series.Once I heard the helmet was coming off, it was like I heard the sounds of distant Plasma Grenades echoing across the city. Lore was ignored or replaced, and we ended up with a weird romance being pitched between Master Chief and someone who wasn't Cortana. It's one of the easiest things to get right. I guess that's what made the following news all the more confusing to me. In an interview with Collider, Tim Miller and Dave Wilson, the men behind the new TV show Secret Level, revealed a few interesting tidbits that definitely caused some sore necks from the massive head turn we all did. For those unaware, Secret Level is an animated anthology series that covers the worlds of 15 different video games. Led in production by Blur Studios and Amazon MGM Studios, the series saw Pac-Man, Warhammer, Sifu, and more make the cut in the first season. It's what didn't show up that people found rather baffling. When asked whether the showrunners went after certain games, Tim Miller responded with, "I get a little chafed when I read online, and they're like, 'Hold on, these assholes took Spelunky when they could have taken Halo?' Or something like that. I'm like, 'Man, you think that we didn't talk to Halo or something?'" Dave Wilson continued later, "The creative director at ID [Software] is a good friend of ours, and so are folks at Microsoft, so we made a big plea because one of the things both Tim and I would love to do is do something that isn't currently available in the games, like crossovers. We wanted to make a Master Chief/Doom Slayer crossover episode, and I spent a whole weekend crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood. And it's exactly what Tim said; they were like, 'Nah.'" Excuse me? Microsoft said what? You had showrunners who were absolutely enthralled with the world of Halo and Doom and wanted to make something extraordinary, and you said no? Not to mention, with Blur Studios leading development, a studio that has already worked on multiple Halo games, you could have had the easiest Stick of your life. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Okay, I get it. You just released your Halo show you've been grinding to get done for almost a decade, and it bombed to the point of cancellation. Maybe you're a little Battle Rifle shy at the moment, but would it really have been any worse than what we got? Off the heels of the Halo TV show and layoffs at 343 Industries, Halo desperately needs a W. Even if a potential Halo and Doom crossover episode finds mixed reviews, it would already be infinitely better than what Paramount produced, but maybe that's the issue. Can Microsoft allow someone else to make a Halo TV show at the moment? After Paramounts failure, a successful spinoff like Secret Level could ruin the relationship between the two companies. While Halo failed, Microsoft has found success with Amazon and its award-winning take on Fallout. Netflix is also currently working on multiple Gears of War projects; there are plenty of IPs Microsoft has yet to explore. It's never a good idea to burn any bridges with a potential future partner on a project down the road. Even though Master Sheets didn't do so well with audiences, that doesn't mean Paramount is empty of video game-adapting talent. You only need to look at Sonic's success to see that (Don't look at the early trailers). Respect the source material, and it's pretty damn easy to find success. Gamers aren't a mystery. Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over sillier things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise that was worldly beloved? Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over more childish things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise, which was a box-office record-setter? At the end of the day, the fans of the series still deserve better. How freaking awesome would it be to see the Doom Slayer and Master Chief ripping apart flood-infested demons to save the human race? You could do it with minimal dialogue, too, where Chief calls out, "I need a weapon," and Doomguy tosses him a BFG with a nod. This writes itself, people! After slaying the demon race and protecting humanity once more, Chief reports back to base for a briefing, and Doomguy goes into cryo while stealing Chief's line, "Wake me when you need me." I didn't even realize how sad this whole thing was until I started writing this fanfic. Is it too late to petition Microsoft to say yes for the second season? At least the Halo Infinite storyline is pretty decent. What do you think? Let us know below or on social media. I'll be checking out the replies and conversing with anyone that wants to. If you're like me, you'll also daydream up some astonishing moments with cliche dialogue that seels the entire thing.

Title: Wishes for 2025 on the Edge of the Abyss
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/wishes-for-2025-on-the-edge-of-the-abyss/
Time Published: 2025-01-01T18:15:41Z

Welcome to the new year! Remember last year when I said things were going to be bad in 2024? Probably not, but I have the link here. In hindsight, I didn’t really allow for how much of that would spill into 2025. Also, a year ago I really meant being constantly bombarded by all the election nonsense. I kind of thought the country would make a better choice after that. I thought it would be temporary nonsense. But no, we have chosen chaos. We have chosen a game show reality TV government because… well, we’re dumb… or willfully ignorant… or masters of self-deception. I mean sure, some out there clearly thought sowing the wind sounded really cool and supported sowing in an unabashed, full throated way, pouring billions of dollars into the “pro-sow” candidates. And now we will spend our time reaping the whirlwind thanks in part to them. But the result was mostly due to people being incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. So shall it be, the people have spoken. The Year is 2025 So here we are on the first day of 2025 and… do I really want to do predictions? On the one hand, there is a bit of a tradition to maintain at this point. I mean, look at this record: That is a 17 year streak and I am not about to break that because the world is going to shit… or at least more so than usual. On the other hand, you can see that I don’t have to do predictions every year. I mean, if you dig into those years when it is something like “Questions,” they really could be seen as predictions. But they are also different in tone and a bit liberating because you don’t have to focus on a goal, just a possible topic. Predictions for 2025 feel like they will just get too dark too quickly given my current mood. Likewise, even questions for the new year ran pretty dark when I started sorting some out in my head. So this year I am going to do wishes. Video game wishes. Let’s keep this manageable. You can wish for world peace on your own time. I am going to list out video game things I want to happen, things I hope will happen, things that might make things better, all in an unsubtle attempt to try and mine some optimism. We shall see. This is something of a turn around as I usually have to state clearly that just because I predict something doesn’t mean I want it to happen. Now I get to run with things I actually want to happen. I will state up front I won’t be wishing for anything bad to happen. No bad mojo. I will also endeavor to not be completely sarcastic or passive aggressive in my wishes…. but you know that is going to slip, right? Look, I am influenced by the world around me… and have you seen this place lately? So cut me some slack. There might be a barb or two in there, but I want my intentions to be clear and in the right place. And if my wishes don’t come true… well, that isn’t on ME now is it? I guess. Better wait until we see what I wish for. But I am going to be leaning heavily on the cosmos and the goodness of people to make this stuff come true. What I have I got then? What am I wishing for? 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Why start small, right? If you got wishes, throw them at a big problem. Unfortunately that lamp I was rubbing the other day… I hope that was a lamp… didn’t promise me anything. And an “end” might be too big of an ask. I would consider the wish fulfilled if we could at least see the industry cycle into a hiring phase and maybe hold of with the acquisition slash and burn to make the line go up a tiny fraction this week. I think I am already off to a bad start with a wish where I won’t be able measure. I guess I’ll just listen to video game devs and see what they’re complaining about. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title Just don’t call it EverQuest Next! Man, was that a dumb name. I am pretty sure that was my stance back whenever… but if it wasn’t, let me say that the name has not grown on me in the mean time. Okay, EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. There was a hint about it being in the ideation phase, but naught else. And while it was on track for 2028 maybe, I am keen to hear if the ideas for it are still rooted in the whole hardcore, be like Elden Ring thing that Ji Ham was espousing back in 2023. A bit of hope or a nugget to hang on to, but more than just some concept art. Lord knows how that screwed us back in the day. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Look, I don’t need full 4K support. That was always a pipe dream anyway. SSG is fully committed to simply maintaining the status quo and adding a bit of content to the game. The idea, for example, that it was ever going to be ported to consoles was absurd on its face, something I called out when that first came up. EG7 has since said they would rather spend the money on developing a new game… though Daybreak has been pretty shy on actually producing a “new” game so far. That said, there are probably half a dozen things of small to medium-ish effort that SSG could do that would make the game more viable on large screens. They could, as an example, get somebody to redo their bitmap skill icons as SVGs so they will not look like ass when you make the the hotbar bigger. (Also an opportunity to make them distinguishable rather than a bunch of red or green blobs with nonsensical iconography, which is something people were calling out back in 2007.) They could make scaling stick for the whole UI, as it reverts to defaults in an annoying number of places between sessions. And they could work on text and dialogs to make them readable on a 4K monitor… with a universal sizing setting maybe? I find it extremely annoying to have to tinker with every aspect of the UI and then have half of it revert when I log off. So just fix that shit. Put in the effort. Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. 5 – Commit to or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know I said no negatives, and I am trying not to go there, but EG7/Daybreak has been living in this delusion for quite a while now where they boost H1Z1 as one of their most important first party franchises at every opportunity while, at the same time, they spend no time or effort on actually doing anything with it. It has basically sat in limbo for since Nantworks gave up and handed the game back to Daybreak, unable to make anything good out of it. And I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Things don’t always go to plan and that roadmap was pretty squishy, but still… figure it out by the end of 2025; commit or stop pretending it is a thing. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing Blizz got a big bounce in hope by announcing that housing was coming to World of Warcraft. The thing they said they would not do, the thing they half-assed as garrisons it what looked like an attempt to prove their point that housing takes people out of the world, the thing that would probably up the long term subscriber retention rate by 5-10% if done right… yeah, do it… and do it right! What does “right” mean? I don’t know. I have a bunch of vague ideas and examples from other titles of things I felt worked and things that I felt did not. But Blizz and its ability to read the room is not something people have come to count on. We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace I feel that nearly a year of Cataclysm Classic has proven the point that classic progression servers can advance too slowly, and that isn’t going to get any better with some of the coming expansions. Find the right pacing Blizz. Also, this reminds me again that I had better consider how to check to see if my wishes have come true. Do wishes need to be SMART? I might not know if this one was granted in 2025. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new They have the money, they have the staff, they can surely find some new idea out in the industry to steal and re-work. They can’t have lost all their skill in that, can they? What non-Blizz titles do Blizz devs play now? Not all Clash of Clans I hope. That’s it though, isn’t it? They all just play phone games because they’re mostly in their 20s. Well, I can still wish I guess. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access I suppose removing the “early access” label from Valheim won’t change anything really. The dirty secret is that early access is your launch and you don’t get another one when you exit. There won’t be a huge spike in sales or a bunch of new press coverage or any magical change to the game when that hits. It will just be “done.” But sometimes “done” is enough. If they deliver the Northlands and wrap up the quest line so that you can finish the game, then that will be good. They could, if they wanted, go all Hello Games and continue to improve it over time, or it could just immediately go into maintenance mode, as so many early access transition titles do, as the team goes off to work on something else. Either way, completion is a nice thing. Maybe it will get some Steam achievements. That might make me go back and play it one more time. Overall though, I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of Valheim. I am done, it can be done. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access This is what started my whole survival co-op frenzy this past year. The mention of Hello Games making this stirred me up. I mean, I really want Light No Fire to launch fully formed because, after the evolution of No Man’s Sky into the game it is today, I want their co-op survival title and their take on the genre… even if it will inevitably be controller-centric. I can deal. But I will take a solid early access and go along for the ride. How much different would the No Man’s Sky journey have been if it had been early access for the first two years? Maybe no different… but maybe it would have set expectations that things were going to continue to evolve. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on While we’re talking about Hello Games, NMS is just a great example of a company committing to a title and just making it better and better over time. They got robbed on the Labor of Love category in the Steam Awards. Only NMS and Stardew Valley really met the criteria of the award. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles On my list for 2025 is Dune: Awakening. I liked a lot about Conan Exiles, and my hope is that Funcom will have learned from that… I mean, CE has been out more than six years at this point. I hope that journey has informed them and allowed them to do something cool with the Dune universe. Going to be an interesting one to judge whether the wish was granted or not. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving I am not one to care much about the monthly free games from Amazon Prime… like I don’t have enough unplayed games in my Steam library already… but when they offer up a code for GoG.com I grab it wholly on the assumption that GoG gets some payment for it and as the old game underdog I want them to succeed and thrive in a way I can only describe as completely opposite to my feelings for the Epic Game Store. (I will not wish bad things on the EGS in this post, but in my heart I might… mostly because Tim Sweeney is a bad person in the way that most US CEOs are bad people.) 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy Passive aggressive much? Actually, that assumes they know what they need to do and, given they have spent three years not doing anything of the sort. So maybe I cannot really argue that this assumption is grounded in any sort of reality. But still, these are wishes, so may the universe magic that knowledge into CCP Rattati’s fore brain and force him to look away from EVE Vanguard for long enough to tell somebody to implement it. 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Look, I am not happy with some of their choices. The blockchain game, EVE Frontier, can (and most likely will) die in a fire. I also do not share the CCP management dream of making a first person shooter, lacking faith in their ability to make something both interesting and unique enough to attract an audience outside of the relatively small New Eden user base. I am also not at all keen on them putting the biggest fan of said shooter in charge of the spaceship game. And EVE Galaxy Conquest… whatever. But, it is in the best interest of those of us who still play their one successful title that something else land and become a success, if only to stabilize the company and make Hilmar less keen to steal resources from the game I play to fund his blockchain fantasies. So if something else could succeed that would be great… and no monkey’s paw where the mobile game makes some money so they abandon EVE Online. In fact, let me just make a “no damn monkey’s paw” side rule right here. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title These are popular, CCP has some of the ground work done. They have more than 20 years of spaceships and nearly 15 years of FPS work in the bag now, maybe take a different tack and make something more manageable that could find a niche and grow? Just a thought. I’d play that… if it was any good at all. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Hey, wishes are free so while I’m here I might as well throw out the idea one more time about a space 4x strategy title set in New Eden where you can play as the main empires or as a null sec leader or even one of the pirate factions as scenarios that takes a strategic view of war and conquest in the New Ede star cluster. I don’t care how. License it to Paradox or something. Just do it. I know, the EVE Online IP isn’t at all popular so nobody would actually play it, but just tack a receptive strategy game audience on to the wish and call it done. We have all the wishes baby! 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done It is out there. He has announced he is working on the third and final volume of his history of null sec and New Eden. We’re going to hear about World War Bee and the great Siege of 1DQ1-A and Vily’s vendetta and eventually the downfall of The Mittani, which will probably be what brings the story to a close. And… well… I am eager to read it. I know it takes time, but that doesn’t mean I can be as patient as I need to be. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Andrew Groen could be tempted into a volume 4 if, you know, we did something interesting. I know, war depends heavily on CCP fixing the economy so alliances are willing to put trillions of ISK on the line. Also, we need something to fight over and CCP’s scarcity plan has backfired completely in that regard. I don’t know. Maybe Gobbins will go on the forums and say “there are no goons” or something. Send Vily back for a rematch. Have Brisc and Merk defect to Fraternity. Let The Initiative start some shit now that they have no blues. Something. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News I know, what we heard was a slip, an accident, but that makes it all the more interesting to find out what is really going on. I am also interested to hear what a dozen years of GW2 has taught the ANet team and how an third title might differ from the second. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll The end of the year game for us was Enshrouded and Keen Games has done a great job with it so for. I’ll even give them a pass the missing in-game chat. Turns out I can live without it is the rest of the game is this good. And a co-op survival builder doesn’t *need* a done state, but it still feels like we should be progressing towards a final boss to cleanse the world or something. So get us going there, keep expanding, and maybe not so many jumping puzzles. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach Playable Worlds still feels like they are a couple years away from Stars Reach being a real, live service game. The big break through was homesteads and 4 hour play tests this year. But there was a lot promised in the design pillars that has yet to see the light of day. Personally, I am waiting for space ships and space travel. So that is my wish I guess, at least get us to space travel in a test galaxy. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 I may regret this wish. Also, I don’t want this until the end of 2025 so I have some time left to get to 50. Niantic pretty much has to do this at some point. There is only so much horizontal progress they can try to pile on. Anyway, I would consider this fulfilled if they even announced a plan for a level cap increase in 2025. There are a lot of hardcore fans who have been at level 50 for a long time now. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake It is the next on the list of old Pokemon titles that have not been remade. It might get me to put my Switch Lite back on the charger and play with it now and then. I wasn’t keen on it as a title when it launched, but when I went back and played it on the 3DS one last time to complete all the pre-Switch titles, I found it had quite a bit to recommend it. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. Of course, I also want to know what horrible stain Marc Andreesen and his tainted, string laden cash has left on the company and the game. There was a promise of some sort of access in late 2025… but there was also a promise of access in 2014, so lies on top of lies seems to be the norm. So, you know, do something already? That is positive, right? 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck There is a long standing tradition in the Civ series of shipping something that really requires the next generation of computers to run. Also bugs, crashes, and a game that really doesn’t settle down until we’ve been sold at least one post-launch expansion pack. I’d like a new Civ game… almost as much as I would like Civ II to be brought up to date… but I have also been there since the dawn of the original… roll that ancient magic quote about being there when they were written… and it has always been a bit of a nightmare on launch. So here is hoping that Sid’s likely final launch for the series is smoother than tradition seems to dictate. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Look, it felt bad to see GTA V fall off of the Platinum tier on the Best of Steam 2024. I mean, Silver tier? Sure, not bad for an 11 year old game, but that probably also means we need a new version. I might not play it, but I feel like I need a couple more gimme wishes in here or my seasonal depression will really ramp up about 12 months from now. 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Then there is Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street and his company Fantastic Pixel Castle, which has been working on an MMO for a couple years now, though this might be my first time mentioning it here on the blog. They have some ideas for a new game, which includes private zones for you and your friends and public zones where you can come into conflict with others and a bunch of things, some of which is being play tested now. It is probably as far along as Stars Reach, maybe further, so it won’t launch in 2025 or even go early access in 2025, but if they had a target date for public access to the game along with a lot more information, I’d consider this wish fulfilled. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish Some little indie studio that I have not heard of at the time of this writing will have a big break-out success and live the indie dev dream for a while. For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominates and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. Work with me on this. I am just going to let this ride until we get to the decision point in December. Why run my wishes any different than my projects at work? 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real Why the hell not? They’re just wishes! Bonus Wishes All wishes are a bonus, that is why they are wishes, right? But in the event that I come up with some additional wish I want to add in, it will be injected here with a time stamp and the cosmos will not be graded down should the wish not be granted. The cosmos will, however, get full credit if the wish is granted. Wish Scoring Dare I score wishes? Like I said, if they don’t come true that is on the cosmos and not me. I am just the wisher, it is up to the wishee to see that wishes come to pass. Is the cosmos going to get pissed if I try to score it? We shall see! That said, some of this still has to play out like predictions. The cosmos will earn 10 points for each wish fulfilled, with partial credit available. Since I am not the one being scored I will tend to be inclined to give the cosmos credit for getting part way there if, say, Civ VII launches as a train wreck but is fixed before summer ends. Just an example. Also, I mentioned SMART above, which stands for “Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time Related,” and you could certainly call me out for some of my wishes not hitting all five. But when it comes to time, if wishes are not fulfilled by December 15, 2025, they will be considered unfulfilled for the purposes of scoring. That is the drop dead date… though if, say, GTA VI launches on December 16th, because it is a Tuesday, then the cosmos will get full credit even if Rockstar will get some dubious looks for such a late in the year launch. The cosmos has 300 points on the table it can earn. We’ll be back in about a year to see how it does for 2025. Off we go. There are consequences to be borne and whirlwinds to be reaped. So that is what I have. What are your happy, positive, maybe slightly passive-aggressive video game wishes for 2025? Did I miss something important? Meanwhile, others have placed stakes in the ground with their own predictions. Here are a few I picked up: Stars Reach is weirdly much further along in development than I imagined it would be and yet wildly far from being anything remotely to close to the game it’s promoted as being. The fact that a game supposedly set in space has no actual space travel is confounding. I really don’t think the current Invisible Elevator To Orbit counts. I hadn’t thought until I read the post what a paradox No Man’s Sky is. These days the received wisdom seems absolutely to be that Early Access is the kiss of death and keeping your powder dry for Full Launch is the only way to go. And yet, as you point out, a premature launch wrecked NMS whereas Early Access could have seen the game lauded almost from the start as an in-development title that was living up to its promise. There would literally not need to be any other differences at all to the pace and content of development other than the labels that were attached to it at certain times. Maybe EA has its benefits after all. Speaking of which, I was waiting for Pantheon to come up in the wish list until it didn’t. Have you checked how EA is going for them? Very well, apparently. A Very Positve Steam rating from more than a thousand reviews and a Currently Playing total that’s still creeping up. I did not expect either of those. Still don’t want to play it but I guess we can wish that the people who do keep on enjoying themselves. LikeLiked by 1 person Like so many things, early access works, except when it doesn’t. You have to have something obviously good for it to work. It is not a shield against criticism. I didn’t have much in the way of thoughts about Pantheon. It does seem to be doing okay, hitting peak concurrent so far today and almost 80% positive reviews. But it also isn’t a buy once title, it is an MMO with a server and staff to maintain. We’ll have to see if what they have so far is enough or if they can grow it. LikeLike Meanwhile, Fantasy Critic just chimed in with this. Did it read my wishes? Fantasy Critic: Half-Life 3 [Available] Just added! Tags: New Game, Unannounced Game Release Date: Unannounced (Estimated) LikeLike The G-Man himself makes me think your Half-Life 3 wish is closer to being true than we might realize: https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922 I don’t care about any cinematic or major announcement. Just let Valve show me a lambda symbol with a 3 on it and I’ll be pumped for *years*. (I mean, this is Valve we’re talking about. They are the only company that makes old-school Blizzard seem fast…) LikeLiked by 1 person My wishes on the computer game front are very modest. 1 – Paradox not to wreck HoI4/Stellaris/EU4 2 – Terra Invicta to continue to be developed. 3 – LOTRO to keep on going 4 – FF14 to remain a generally chill and friendly place, unlike some other fantasy worlds one could mention. For those where I actually have to do something myself: 5 – Complete at least one of the RPGs I love (but where I keep getting distracted) 6 – Complete base Endwalker in FF14 (currently in Shadowbringers, but I dawdle) 7 – Complete a play through on at least one currently unplayed game in my Steam Library. We shall see LikeLiked by 1 person I also really hope GOG sticks around. DRM-free games are always nice to have, and I appreciate how they try to keep the games they sell playable on modern operating systems. LikeLiked by 1 person FWIW, Valheim is still on my Steam Wishlist, but I’m one of those nuts who refuse to buy a game that is in Early Access. Once it leaves Early Access and I know the game has a complete storyline, I’m in. LikeLike I feel you. As I replied to Bhagpuss, early access is one of those things that works, except when it doesn’t. In the case of Valheim I think what is there when it does comes out of early access will be much better than what might have arrived had they insisted on waiting until it was “done” to launch it. Or not. The whole “must be annoyingly difficult” aspects of the last three biomes might have been skipped had they waited. Who knows? I will say, once again, that I got my money’s worth out of it with three big play-throughs. LikeLike Wishes do have a sort of ‘softness’ or positivity versus predictions that I like. Kudos for coming up with that. Half Life 3: I feel like I’m too out of touch with all of the ‘2+’ material now to be the proper audience for the game. Back in the day in the year or two after Half Life 2 launched I was desperate for the next episode. Now I’d probably need a full set of remakes of the intermediate content to get up to speed again. LikeLike The 20th Anniversary update might just be the thing for you, then: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001. Both episodes and the Lost Coast bit are now included with the main game. LikeLike The WoW roadmap you linked does show housing coming at the end of 2025… so we might get to find out about that wish sooner than you seem to think! LikeLike The roadmap shows a little icon, which could mean whatever Blizz decides it means. Given their history, I have trouble seeing Blizz launching housing outside of a full expansion release, and we aren’t even getting the next expansion reveal until late next year. I am skeptical like that. Anyway, my wish is that they don’t screw it up. We might know enough to register that before Dec. 15. LikeLike I knew you were gonna say that! 😄 It’s because of people like you (or possibly other reasons) that they actually changed the roadmap from the original image (which matches the one you uploaded) to one that simply shows a house at that point. LikeLike They changed the icon later? How rude! Still, it is just an icon, which lends itself to some level of ambiguity. It could mean housing starts for the holidays. It could mean the big housing reveal with a launch at a later date. It could mean an new trailer with no details. And, where it stands, it could mean nothing before Dec. 15th, so no wish granted.

Title: 2024 gaming report card: how did PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo fare?

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? After a long and busy 12 months, 2024 is officially in the books. Players have a few weeks to rest before the video game release calendar picks up in February with a barrage of major releases. That’s a problem for next month, though. Until then, we’ve still got some time to reflect on what was a rollercoaster year for the gaming industry, full of surprise hits, total flops, and surprising no shows. At the center of all that was the three pillars of mainstream gaming: Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. While their power may be waning in the age of portable PCs like the Steam Deck, these platform holders are still the watercooler conversation starters whose every move generates buzz. This year, all three companies found themselves in a strange spot. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X hit the awkward midpoint of their lifespans, while the Nintendo Switch was left to tread water after its much anticipated successor was pushed out of 2024. All three would have to get creative if they were going to end the year strong. The good news is that all three pulled that task off, even if no one excelled. Each company had an asterisk on its record that created an uneven year no matter which console you played on. Continuing last year’s tradition, we’re once again closing out the year by handing out final grades to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. All three passed, but they’ll all need to study harder if they’re going to become A students in 2025. If I were a tough grader, I’d have good reason to flunk the PS5 this year. Sony’s year was full of flops and disappointments that made its 2024 look dire in a vacuum. Its biggest hardship came in the form of Concord, a game that was meant to usher in PlayStation’s live service future. Instead, it was an immediate failure that was taken offline in weeks and the studio behind it was shuttered. That one costly disaster may have put years of planning in jeopardy, single-handedly changing what PlayStation’s future will look like. That bad news was coupled by some soft letdowns. The much anticipated PS5 Pro finally launched this year, but with underwhelming specs considering its eye-popping price tag. That made the system a slow starter, one that raised questions about how much incremental power is really necessary in a console. It didn’t help that the system’s AI upscaling tool, PSSR, was a bit buggy at launch, too. Elsewhere on the hardware front, Sony seemed to all but abandon its VR ambitions, offering very little software support for PlayStation VR2 (it’s biggest upgrade this year was PC support). At times, it felt like Sony’s hardware business had hit a brick wall. If I were only looking at those lowlights, though, it would be a reductive view of what was a strong year for PlayStation overall. Sony’s wins didn’t come from hyped up first-party exclusives like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but through unexpected surprises that helped expand the system to new audiences. The crown jewel of the crop was Astro Bot, which found Sony once again making the kind of all-ages platformer that helped build the original PlayStation. Helldivers 2 emerged as a live service success story that counter-balanced Concord‘s failure. Even Stellar Blade landed as a pleasant surprise, allowing a Korean developer to find international success. In between those peaks, we got a handful of third-party exclusives that gave the PS5 the best game lineup of any console this year. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth delivered the praise that Final Fantasy XVI couldn’t quite achieve in 2023, while Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 pulled off the impossible task of remaking one of the best games of all time in a satisfying manner. Those highs were enough to round out an uneven year where Sony leaned heavily on unnecessary double dips like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It may have been the PS5’s best and worst year in one. Grade: B Since the launch of the Xbox Series X in 2020, it was clear that Microsoft’s console was going to have an unusual lifespan. Microsoft made it clear early on that it wasn’t necessarily trying to pump out killer apps so much as it was trying to make Game Pass a lifestyle subscription service that every gamer needed. 2024 would take that experiment to some truly unpredictable places that left Xbox fans with whiplash; we seemingly alternated between terrible news and great games every month. The bad side was very bad. Xbox kicked the year off with mass layoffs, which shut down both Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. The latter was incredibly puzzling considering that the studio had developed perhaps the Series X’s best exclusive, Hi-Fi Rush, just one year prior. Later in the year, Microsoft rolled out a convoluted Game Pass price hike that turned the “best deal in gaming” into a pricey proposition. It didn’t help that some of the service’s biggest games didn’t exactly pan out as expected. Both Stalker 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 were buggy messes at launch, while Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Starfield: Shattered Space landed as underwhelming releases. It was a constant PR crisis for Xbox in 2024, even when it wasn’t warranted. Xbox’s decision to release certain exclusives on competing platforms should have been a cause for celebration as Microsoft eroded the annoying exclusivity wall that divides consoles. Instead, the move fueled console war outrage. Similar, Xbox made great strides to make its game more accessible than ever, bringing Game Pass to devices like Amazon Fire Stick. That too was criticized thanks to the company’s “This is an Xbox” ad campaign, which implied that any device that could run its games was essentially an Xbox. That move rubbed console purists the wrong way, but I see the underlying message as a positive step forward for video games. While it wasn’t a huge year for exclusives, Xbox delivered where it mattered. It ended the year strong with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, two of the best-received games of this Xbox generation. In route to those tentpole release, we got a steady stream of “day one” third-party releases that still sold the service’s value. Dungeons of Hinterberg and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess are both sleeper hits that ended up on Digital Trends best 10 games of 2024 list. With that in mind, I’m willing to let Xbox out of 2024 with a perfectly good, if unremarkable grade. I expect to see some big improvement in 2025, though. Grade: B- After receiving a coveted A grade in last year’s report, Nintendo had a big task ahead of it — and it sounded like it would have no problem delivering. After all, 2024 was surely going to be the year we finally got the Nintendo Switch 2, bringing a bevy of heavy hitting exclusives like Mario Kart 9 or Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Well … that didn’t happen. After all the anticipation, Nintendo’s new console was a total no show. Nintendo would acknowledge its existence after years of speculation, but it stopped short of actually showing it off or announcing so much as a spec. That left Nintendo in a weird spot when it came to software. It was clear that the company’s most celebrated developers were quietly working on new games for the platform, leaving the B-squad to fill out the Switch’s final full year. To Nintendo’s credit, it delivered at least one exclusive a month from January to December, but the actually lineup was eclectic. Very few Switch exclusives released in 2024 were must-own library additions. The closest ones were Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, but nothing rose to the level of Super Mario Odyssey or Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Instead, we got a buffet of niche games and odd remakes. It’s not that games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong or Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition weren’t welcome on Switch; it’s just that these were the console’s primary games rather than quirky filler. Those games didn’t always deliver either, as games like Endless Ocean: Luminous and Princess Peach: Showtime! felt more like underdeveloped experiments than the kind of polished games we’ve come to expect in the Switch’s lifespan. Even if it was an underwhelming year overall, the experimental nature of Switch’s year occasionally led to the kind of highlights that can only happen when a publisher isn’t being precious. Emio — The Smiling Man is a fantastic revival of Famicom Detective Club that I don’t think we would ever get outside of a year like this. Splatoon 3‘s underappreciated Side Order DLC is a true hidden gem, and I can’t complain about a full remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. The peaks weren’t exactly high, but this is the kind of strange year that I imagine I’ll look back on with nostalgia in a few years when Nintendo is back in its usual rotation of predictable hits. Grade: C+ With all of the political turmoil right now, it can be hard to get in the festive spirit — but PowerWash Simulator wants to help with its latest free update, offering a Christmas-themed ice rink map to explore and clean up. You might think you've gotten your fill of that already, especially if you had to clean real-world decorations before bringing them in from the garage, but we promise that digital muck is a lot more fun to clean up than the real thing. And we'll take digital spiders over the real ones any day of the week. Grab a nice warm cup of hot chocolate, some comfortable shoes, and snuggle up for a night of the most fun cleaning you've ever done. The update introduces a new, free DLC that comes with the ice rink area, as well as winter weather gear so that you can bundle up while on the job. The clothing includes a cleaning suit emblazoned with snowflakes, a candy cane theme for the sprayer, and more. If you've never played the game before, now's the perfect chance. The update also comes with a free demo so you can get a taste of what makes this game so relaxing to play. If you find you enjoy it, there's plenty more free DLC to check out yourself, as well as paid DLC for fans of Shrek and Warhammer: 40,000. The MMO genre is overflowing with titles vying for the attention of anyone willing to invest significant portions of their time in a single game. There are no doubt plenty of killer choices you can make based on what type of combat, endgame, and payment model you prefer, ensuring that you'll almost certainly find one that fits you just right. I've been investing off and on in the genre for over two decades, with thousands of hours poured into everything from old, niche titles like Silkroad Online (which I just learned somehow still exists) to worldwide successes like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars. In recent years, though, I find myself disappointed in various aspects of many popular MMOs, whether it's an overwhelming focus on endgame raiding, too much PVP-centric content, or unfriendly communities that make me cringe when I even glance at the chat. None of that is a problem when I return to Final Fantasy XIV. I somehow feel at peace each time I load up Square Enix's long-running MMO, and it's becoming harder and harder for me to want to venture elsewhere. Sony could be following up the release of the PlayStation Portal with a new handheld PlayStation 5 console, according to a new report. Bloomberg claims that Sony is working on a portable PlayStation 5 and would be in direct competition with the Nintendo Switch successor or an Xbox handheld, which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said is in early testing. However, the PlayStation handheld is likely years away from an announcement even if it makes it to production. So nothing is guaranteed.

A fall from the top doesn’t mean you can’t climb your way back up. Propelled by pro-Trump endorsements, multi-million dollar investments and cryptocurrency bets, our list illustrates some formerly-disgraced leaders bringing their careers, and businesses, back to the top. For over a decade Forbes has documented the most notable career crashes (see the 2024 list here), so we thought it appropriate to look at the business leaders who have bounced back in 2024, bringing their businesses and careers back from the brink. Yes, the mighty can fall, but they can also make their way back to the top. Former President Donald Trump left office in 2021 twice impeached and in debt. This time around, he's coming into office more popular, and richer, than ever. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) If there is one man who knows how to make a comeback, it’s Donald Trump. Despite having three outstanding criminal cases and awaiting sentencing after becoming a convicted felon, the 78-year-old will be sworn in as the United States' 47th President on January 20th after winning a closely-watched presidential race. Last time he was in office, Trump left the White House twice impeached, drowning in debt and with a disapproval rating of 62%, the highest of any President leaving office other than Richard Nixon. Now, a majority of Americans approve of his handling of the presidential transition. Today, on the heels of his decisive election victory, Trump is more popular than ever. He’s currently worth $6.2 billion, down from a peak of $8.1 billion in May. Businessman and close ally of Donald Trump, Elon Musk tops our careers comebacks list after two years of career crashes. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When Elon Musk landed on Forbes’ list of most notable career crashes in 2022, his new ownership of Twitter (now X) was all to blame. In his short tenure as CEO before Linda Yaccarino stepped in, he botched layoffs, mocked users, flipped on policies and worried investors across his business portfolio, most notably Tesla. Today, he’s the richest man in the world. In December he became the first person to surpass a $400 billion net worth, thanks to a new $350 billion valuation for SpaceX. It accounts for a more than $150 billion jump in wealth this year, thanks in part to his 13% stake in Tesla, whose stock is up 70% this year, and an estimated 54% stake in xAI, which investors reportedly valued at $50 billion in November. Beyond his wealth, Musk also holds the top spot in Trump’s new brain trust. After spending $200 million to get Trump elected, he was tapped to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, which will advise on ways to cut government spending, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. WeWork founder Adam Neumann launched and opened the first apartments of his new co-living startup, Flow this year after receiving over $300 million in funding. (Photo by Romain Maurice/Getty Images) The founder and former CEO of WeWork returned to the headlines this year in a series of splashy commitments to purchase the co-working company out of bankruptcy. Under Neumann’s leadership, WeWork went from a startup valued at $47 billion to a failed IPO before he stepped down as CEO. In February, Neumann announced he’d buy back the company for $650 million alongside Dan Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point, but the offer was ultimately rebuffed. Instead, he turned his sights into developing his latest real estate startup. In August, Neumann’s Flow quietly opened up its first property in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The startup, which is the billionaire’s latest attempt at building co-living and working spaces, raised $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022 to build “the future of living.” Its two other branded properties in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida, opened in April. All of these new investments have contributed to Neumann’s continued billionaire status; his $2.3 billion net worth comes from a nearly 10% stake in WeWork, majority stakes in apartment buildings worth $1 billion before debt and the over $1 billion 2022 valuation of Flow. Michael Saylor's bet on bitcoin is paying off this year as the cryptocurrency surpassed $100,000 for the first time. (Photo by Jason Koerner/Getty Images for Bitcoin Magazine) Bitcoin maximalist and MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor had an epic 2024. The former rocket scientist has turned MicroStrategy into one of the biggest institutional holders of bitcoin, owning 439,000 coins now worth an approximate $44 billion. While some were skeptical of the software company’s extreme bitcoin holdings––the company now describes itself as “the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company”––it’s paying off. MicroStrategy’s stock is up 403% this year, outstripping bitcoin’s 137% gain and the S&P 500’s 24% return. Saylor has only cashed in on stock price surge, bolstered even further by its mid-December inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 stock index, the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund. All in all, Saylor’s net-worth has more than doubled in the last year, thanks to his personal bitcoin holdings and his stake in MicroStrategy. He’s currently worth $8.7 billion. Fran Horowitz became CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch when the company hit its lowest stock price in history. Today, it's one of the best-performing mid-cap stocks, and its products are loved from teens to millennials alike. (Photo by Dominik Bindl/Getty Images) The CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch is enjoying another year of growth for the millennial and GenZ-loved apparel company. Under the leadership of Fran Horowitz, who came in as CEO in 2017, the company’s stock has risen from an all-time low of under $10 per share to today’s $149. It’s helped it become one of the top mid-cap stocks in the United States this year, with a 500% growth since 2023 and 60% this year. Horowitz’s focus on inclusive sizing, a broadened product range and a new brand image targeting professionals has propelled twelve-month sales to $4.8 billion in December, up 20% from last year. New this year is a wedding dress business. Horowitz has propelled the company’s sales and financial success all while fighting off associations of its past. In October, the Department of Justice charged former CEO Mike Jeffried with sex trafficking and interstate prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty. Bernard Looney, former BP CEO, swapped oil for AI data centers. (Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP) (Photo by ARUN SANKAR/AFP via Getty Images) Just one year after the former CEO of BP abruptly resigned from the job after failing to disclose past relationships with female colleagues at the company, Bernard Looney is joining the board of Prometheus Hyperscale, a Wyoming-based data company. In May, Prometheus Hyperscale signed a partnership agreement with Oko, a nuclear energy company backed by Open AI CEO Sam Altman. In his new position as chairman of the board, Looney will be leading the company’s effort to build its flagship $10 billion data center in Evanston. In the last month, he’s also joined the board of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). Prior to his resignation in September 2023, Looney had a long career at the british oil and gas giant, climbing the ranks from a post-graduate drilling engineer to chief executive for just three years. While BP said he technically didn’t breach company rules, he wasn’t “fully transparent” and did have to forfeit more than $40 million in compensation and some of his previous bonus for “knowingly mis[leading] the board” in an act of “serious misconduct.” John Galliano is leaving his position as creative director of Maison Margiela ten years after the french luxury house first hired him. (Photo by Jacopo Raule/Getty Images) Talk about leaving at the top. After leading Maison Margiela as creative director for the last ten years and stunning the fashion world with January’s Maison Margiela Artisanal show, John Galliano is set to depart the French luxury fashion house. He’s responsible for the brand’s infamous Tabi shoes and a 23% growth in sales in 2023, according to Vogue Business. As for what’s next after Maison Margiela, he’s tight-lipped. “When the time is right, all will be revealed,” he wrote on an Instagram post. It’s a sharp contrast to how the British designer first started working with the brand. The Maison Margiela job was his first after a scandalous exit from Dior in 2011, where he’d been creative director since 1996. Galliano was largely credited for turning Christian Dior into a multimillion-dollar brand, but was fired during Paris Fashion Week after videos surfaced of him making antisemitic remarks. His comeback from fashion world exile to fashion and internet fame was so grand it’s been charted on the Amazon Prime documentary High and Low: John Galliano, released in March. It turns out it is possible to have a career crash and a comeback all in one year. In May, Sankaet Pathank, founder and CEO of the fintech Synapse was ousted from the company as a bankruptcy judge removed existing management and appointed an independent Chapter 11 trustee to oversee the company. The struggling banking-as-a-service company finally filed for bankruptcy this year after a year of searching for banking partners and potential buyers. In its wake it’s frozen tens of thousands of customers out of $114 million of their own funds, but lawyers say up to 20 million end-users are at risk. As the court goes on with bankruptcy proceedings, Pathak is already looking at, and funding, his new venture. In August he told TechCrunch he’d raised $11 million from Tribe Capital, among others, for his new company, Foundation, a robotics startup that aims to create humanoid robots to address the labor shortage.
