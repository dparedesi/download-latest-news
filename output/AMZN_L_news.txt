We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Boeing's turnaround plan is something any business can relate to: focus on the culture and the work
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-new-ceo-kelly-ortberg-turnaround-plan-for-other-businesses-2024-10

Good morning! Are you a fan of the "John Wick" franchise? If so, you owe a big thank you to Eva Longoria. She provided $6 million in gap financing when the first movie ran out of money and was at risk of shutting down. Our sale on a Business Insider subscription also kicks off today. Check out the details here. In today's big story, Boeing's new CEO has big plans for the company's turnaround, including executives rolling up their sleeves. What's on deck: But first, let's get this flight back on track. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Boeing's new CEO is looking to navigate a turnaround that includes rethinking the aerospace giant's culture. Boeing reported a $6.1 billion loss in the third quarter, the latest knock for a company that's faced constant setbacks this year, writes Business Insider's Pete Syme. But new CEO Kelly Ortberg has some ideas for how to fix Boeing's "festering of issues." In a memo to employees, he detailed a four-part plan for how Boeing can regain its place as an "iconic company and aerospace leader," BI's Benjamin Zhang reports. You might think a nearly $100 billion company that builds airplanes needs a specific solution. But at its core, Ortberg's plan is something any business can appreciate: focus on the culture and the work being done. For Boeing that means putting executives on factory floors with the hope it will address safety, communication, and employee trust issues, writes BI's Taylor Rains. Whether you're making sandwiches or 737s, having a front-row seat to how the work is being done often provides a better view of a company's inefficiencies than any boardroom can. Of course, Boeing's problem's are slightly more complicated than perfecting a BLT. Just a few days into 2024, a Boeing 737 Max suffered a blowout incident that tanked the company's stock and drew the attention of Congress. Since then, it has also been dealing with a costly strike and a struggling space program. Plenty of business turnarounds include talking to those in the thick of it. Starbucks' new CEO Brian Niccol, who is trying to stop the coffee chain's sales slide, is looking to baristas for help. He mentioned fixing some of the biggest problems Starbucks' "green-apron partners" have flagged to executives, like devising a better way to manage mobile orders. The effort to get direct feedback from the people doing the work is evident in Big Tech, too. The "year of efficiency" has become more of an era as tech giants like Meta and Amazon continue to flatten their organizations. Those efforts have downsides, though. Tech giants' focus on the work has meant a steady stream of layoffs as they keep removing layers. The end result could have an impact on morale. What's going on with the "whale" betting on a Trump win? Here are some theories. Someone has bet roughly $46 million on former President Donald Trump reclaiming the White House on Polymarket. Political and betting-market commentators have speculated it's either an influence campaign, a pump-and-dump scheme, or simply a bullish view on Trump's prospects next month. 2. Whether it's Trump or Harris, Steve Schwarzman isn't worried about a post-election recession. The billionaire Blackstone CEO has publicly backed the former president, but he doesn't see Vice President Kamala Harris winning as a recession risk. "The economy is pretty strong and both of the candidates keep mentioning a lot of stimulative policies," Schwarzman said. 3. Apple stock dips on reports of dimming demand for the new iPhone. Apple stock dropped as much as 3% on Wednesday after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities said Tim Cook's company cut orders by 10 million units. Kuo also saw "no evidence" AI features were boosting demand. Meanwhile, the production of the Vision Pro is reportedly in flux. Introducing AI's power players. Now in its second year, Business Insider's 2024 AI Power list maps out who wields real power in artificial intelligence and machine learning. This year's list honors people hoping to effect change and solve problems across the industry, from Groq CEO Jonathan Ross to Google DeepMind COO Lila Ibrahim. 2. Tesla did better than expected in Q3. The electric carmaker reported earnings per share of $0.62 — a big beat over analysts expectations of $0.51. It also announced the Cybertruck turned a profit, marking a major win for Elon Musk as he enters the electric pickup market. Analysts saw the latest numbers as a clear sign that Tesla shouldn't neglect its roots. 3. A ban on celebrity jet-tracking isn't a bad idea. But Meta still has some explaining to do. This week, the company suspended Threads accounts that shared flight data of figures like Taylor Swift and Donald Trump, citing safety concerns. That seems reasonable, but it doesn't explain why Meta chose to wait until now to apply the three-year-old recommendation.

Title: Amazon exec says 9 out of 10 workers are happy with the company’s RTO mandate—but research suggests many of them will up and leave

Amazon isn’t only putting its foot down and reaffirming its commitment to returning to working in an office five days a week from January 2025—one of the company’s top execs is even claiming that employees are rejoicing at the mandate. Matt Garman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, insisted that “nine out of 10” workers he had spoken to are looking forward to the new policy being enforced. And if they’re not? “That’s okay, there are other companies around,” the head of the tech giant’s cloud computing business said in an internal call that’s been reviewed by Reuters. Research suggests that many employees may do exactly that. Garman may be in for a shock: Despite his assessment that most workers are raring to return to their desks, reams of research suggest that many will be disgruntled and take up his offer to quit. Already, 67% of U.S. employers have lost talent to competitors offering remote or hybrid work options in the past six months, according to a new report from Remote. Globally, over 73% of employers across 10 countries, including the U.K., Germany and Japan, have faced a similar dilemma after calling time on remote work. After all, they’re competing with the 70% of firms that have said they’re embracing—and even broadening—their remote policies. The same percentage of businesses have said that they’ve accepted hybrid working as the new norm. You can already see this in action at Amazon: A handful of employees anonymously told Fortune that they had already contacted recruiters and interviewed for more flexible jobs just 48 hours after the tech giant announced it’s toughened stance on working from home. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” an exasperated working mom complained. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” She’s not alone: The anonymous job review site Blind polled 2,585 verified Amazon professionals one day after its CEO Andy Jassy sent out the RTO memo and 73% admitted they are considering quitting in response. Over a third said that they knew someone at the company who had already handed in their resignation because of the announcement. Amazon declined to comment on how it’s readying itself for a potential exodus of staff—or whether that’s what the $1.94 trillion tech giant secrently really wants. While Jassy positioned Amazon’s changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better, more collaborative way to work, some employees are adamant that it’s a thinly veiled headcount reduction. After all, research recently found that a quarter of C-suite executives secretly hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing an RTO policy. “It’s a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” a Gen X program manager told Fortune. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: What CIOs and other tech leaders are prioritizing as they plan their 2025 budgets

As Mike Anderson plans tech spending for next year, the technology leader is asking all of Netskope’s vendors for fresh updates about their generative artificial intelligence product roadmap and pricing plans. “We’re not making any long-term commitments to any software providers,” says Anderson, who serves as chief digital and information officer at the cloud-based security company. “The change is happening so rapidly.” Surveys have consistently shown that chief information officers and other technology C-suite leaders will spend more on generative AI next year. But now two years into the generative AI journey, they are also thinking more about getting a return on those investments, while also expressing increased skepticism about how AI is priced. The per-user cost for AI copilots, often $30 for each employee, is a frequent pain point. There is also wariness about “AI washing,” which is the notion that vendors are adding fees for flimsy new AI features with little to no business value. “A lot of people are scratching their heads,” says Anderson. “I don’t really know if I can afford $30 per user.” McKinsey senior partner Aamer Baig agrees, sharing “It’s safe to say the CIOs are very irritated by these enterprise vendors pricing strategies for generative AI.” CIOs say they are intrigued and even welcome some recent industry pricing pivots, most notably by Salesforce, to consumption-based pricing. “If I get to a point where I have good predictability around what my usage is, I’m sure that the vendors will negotiate some type of a contract that helps me control my costs,” says Anderson. Baig says McKinsey’s clients are paying attention to the one-time costs of AI investments, but also discovering that for every $1 spent on developing an AI model, they are spending $3 on change management, meaning training staff and actively tracking their performance and the value of their investments in the technology. “There have been some surprises,” says Baig. Principal Financial CIO Kathy Kay says the financial investment management and insurance company has evolved budget planning from an annual cycle to a quarterly cadence, allowing for more fluidity to move dollars depending on new priorities or changes to the business. Kay says she will spend more on generative AI in 2025, but that the core function of IT is to also find ways to do work cheaper and faster. “I’m not a proponent of just asking to increase my spending without good business rationale,” says Kay. Dave Williams, chief information and digital officer at Merck, anticipates the pharmaceuticals company will also increase spending on generative AI, as well as cybersecurity, edge computing, drug development, and to make manufacturing more efficient. “We see a huge opportunity to leverage cloud, gen AI, and the combination [of those technologies], to accelerate the core of what we do, which is get new vaccines and medicines to patients faster,” says Williams. Rajeev Rajan, chief technology officer for Atlassian, says the software provider is “very prudent about how much we spend on R&D. We look at our overall revenue, our overall budget, and we keep it in good proportion.” He’s also spending more on AI, but a yearslong project to get customers to migrate data from on-premise to the cloud is wrapping up, requiring less funding. Atticus Tysen, Intuit’s chief information security officer, says the financial software company starts annual budget planning by first allocating dollars toward security, and then everything else. “As the CISO and the CIO, I have to be careful about that and not take up all the money,” says Tysen. One big priority for 2025 is Intuit’s continued embrace of a multi-cloud strategy. While Intuit primarily leans on Amazon Web Services, it has acquired brands, like Credit Karma, which have built their data processing on rival offerings. By working with more than one cloud provider, Intuit can select the best service from AWS or Microsoft or Google that will match a specific need. “There’s no reason to really move or change that,” says Tysen, regarding keeping Credit Karma on Google Cloud Platform. “They wouldn’t get any customer benefit out of it. There wouldn’t be any particular cost savings.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI agents still come with a lot of questions. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at the emerging world of AI agents, which rely on generative AI and promise to follow more intricate instructions than a chatbot. But big questions remain on how much human intervention will be needed, the best governance to protect the data that’s being used in a new way, and what kind of autonomous decision-making will be allowed for AI agents versus prior forms of automation. There’s also the ongoing issue of the price that vendors hope to command, either through per-user or outcome-based fees, and what businesses are ultimately willing to pay. OpenAI and Bain strike AI partnership; but tension emerges with Microsoft. OpenAI and Bain & Co. are expanding their pact to sell ChatGPT and other tools to clients of the consulting firm, the Wall Street Journal reports, and Bain is putting about 50 employees into the joint effort to build industry-specific AI tools, something many tech leaders have been waiting for. Separately, the New York Times has reported on tension between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has already put $13 billion into the upstart. At issue: OpenAI's desire to secure more computing power and reduce expenses, and Microsoft's worries about becoming too reliant on OpenAI for its AI advancements. Meta announces fresh rounds of layoffs. The social media giant, which announced mass rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023, will lay off about 100 employees across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, Fortune reported. The latest cuts are due to reorganizing the structure of those teams to align with long-term strategic goals, Meta says, differing from the larger, mass layoffs in the past couple of years. Separately, Meta fired some staffers from the Los Angeles office for abusing the company’s $25 meal stipend and spending money from the corporate perk on groceries, household items, and meals when they weren’t even in the office. Gopuff fires CTO months after battery arrest. Sreekant Kotay, who has served as CTO for grocery-delivery company Gopuff, was reportedly fired on Friday several months after he was arrested on a felony battery charge and for alleged possession of illegal drugs, The Information reports. Citing court records, the outlet also reports that Kotay has pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Kotay has served as CTO of Gopuff for two stints, from 2017 through 2019 and again in early 2023 until he was ousted last week. He's also previously served as CTO at Comcast and as SVP of technology at AOL. Most companies still aren’t data-ready for generative AI. A new report by IT consulting firm Accenture found that six out of ten "reinvention-ready" companies—the early movers on generative AI—have their data assets modernized for gen AI use cases, have clear data governance, and are able to trace their data from the original source through the AI lifecycle. All other companies, that fall into less advanced AI criteria like "automated" or "foundational," aren't as far along in their AI data readiness journey. One barrier that automated and foundational companies face is that their data sits with a wide array of vendors, but there are often slight data variations, preventing “a single source of truth,” says Laura Peterson, senior managing director at Accenture. “It is actually core to being able to run your business in a different way,” says Peterson, regarding the importance of performing “data cleanup” that’s more comprehensive than a one-time event that tends to be tied to system updates. She also advises that IT and business leaders partner to get on the same page and make it a priority.

Title: Amazon to shut down speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/amazon-shut-speedy-brick-mortar-delivery-service-rcna176685

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon is shutting down a service that offers same-day delivery from mall and brick-and-mortar retailers, CNBC has learned. The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company’s broader cost-cutting efforts. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across the company in order to meet rapidly changing macro conditions. Beginning in 2022 and extending through 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Jassy has taken a harder line on the company’s unproven, costlier bets than his predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Jassy has axed several projects, including a telehealth service, video-calling device for kids and a roving Treasure Truck. Launched in 2022, Amazon Today allows retailers who sell on Amazon to offer speedy delivery from their brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in select cities. Amazon’s contracted Flex drivers, which make deliveries using their own vehicles, fetch the packages and drop them at customers’ doorsteps within hours of when the orders were placed. Amazon Today was part of the company’s push to get online purchases to shoppers’ doorsteps at faster speeds. Amazon continues to add more facilities focused on same-day deliveries in a bid to boost sales and compete with other companies that provide ultrafast delivery. That includes Instacart and DoorDash, which have expanded beyond food and groceries and into retail. The company had signed up several retailers to Amazon Today, according to the program’s website. That list included Office Depot; Staples; Petco; PacSun; vitamin and dietary supplement chain GNC; and Fabletics, the athletic-wear brand owned by actress Kate Hudson. Amazon is working with the retailers it signed up for the service to ensure a smooth transition for them, the company said. Amazon added that it continues to prioritize and invest in fast delivery. The decision to shutter Amazon Today comes as a surprise since Amazon was in the process of onboarding other retailers, one of the people said. The company was also pitching the service to more retailers at a conference last week. The service skewed more costly than traditional delivery routes where Flex drivers can fill their cars up with packages from an Amazon warehouse, one of the people said. Amazon Today routes, which the company calls “retail deliveries,” did not usually fill up a driver’s trunk, making the program less worthwhile for the Flex contractors.

The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. Amazon disputed the figure, saying there were approximately 175 employees in the unit. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company's broader cost-cutting efforts. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across the company in order to meet rapidly changing macro conditions. Beginning in 2022 and extending through 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Jassy has taken a harder line on the company's unproven, costlier bets than his predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Jassy has axed several projects, including a telehealth service, video-calling device for kids and a roving Treasure Truck. Launched in 2022, Amazon Today allows retailers who sell on Amazon to offer speedy delivery from their brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in select cities. Amazon's contracted Flex drivers, which make deliveries using their own vehicles, fetch the packages and drop them at customers' doorsteps within hours of when the orders were placed. Amazon Today was part of the company's push to get online purchases to shoppers' doorsteps at faster speeds.

Title: Walmart to deliver prescriptions directly to customers in hit to sinking CVS, Walgreens
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/business/walmart-to-deliver-prescriptions-to-customers-doors/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:14:21Z

Walmart announced on Tuesday it will start delivering prescriptions straight to consumers’ doors in as little as 30 minutes – threatening to further cripple struggling pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens. The discount retailer has made its prescription delivery option available in Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, the company said. Walmart expects the delivery option will be available in 49 states by the end of January — leaving out only North Dakota due to state laws. The delivery service is free for Walmart+ members. It will cost all other customers $9.95. Walmart hopes those needing prescriptions will also to tack on other items, like chicken noodle soup or tissues, to boost overall sales. Nearly 60% of Walmart’s annual revenue comes from its groceries division, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company. The health division accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the US, the company said in a filing for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. The announcement of Walmart’s new speedy delivery system sent shares of CVS and Walgreens down 2.1% and 6.8%, respectively on Tuesday – despite both chains offering their own same-day delivery options. Walmart has a large consumer base, with coverage of more than 86% of US households, the company said. It expects the majority of its existing customers will shift over to the delivery service, according to Bloomberg. Tom Ward, Walmart’s chief e-commerce officer, told Bloomberg the company is “aware of the wider landscape.” Walmart will be able to leverage its fast delivery times and large network of stores with the new prescription service, Ward said. Walmart said the delivery option is a response to customer demand. More than half of Walmart customers expressed a desire to have their prescriptions delivered along with their groceries in a single online order, according to a recent Walmart survey. The discount chain has been able to attract inflation-battered customers. Walmart shares are up 53.5% so far this year. Meanwhile, traditional pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens are struggling to stay afloat. CVS shares are down 29.6% so far this year, and Walgreens shares are down 63.5% in the same period. Consumers have pulled back on spending due to high prices and long-lasting inflation. Low spending coupled with competition from Amazon and big-box retailers has hampered CVS’ and Walgreens’ business. Both companies have taken steps to cut costs. CVS ousted its CEO, Karen Lynch, and replaced her with David Joyner this week as it faces growing pressure from activist investors. The pharmacy chain unveiled plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years, including layoffs across its corporate sector affecting about 1% of its workforce, or 2,900 jobs. CVS is also close to completing its three-year plan to shutter 900 stores. The company has closed 851 locations as of August. Last week, Walgreens said it will close about 1,200 stores over the next three years – including 500 in the next fiscal year alone. Advertisement

Americans are cutting down holiday spending, as more professionals feel the crunch of rising home ... [+] costs With the festive season just around the corner, many Americans are cutting down on spending for Christmas gifts. "U.S. shoppers say they're going to spend less on holiday gifts this year, which would deliver another blow to retailers that have struggled with waning demand," Bloomberg reported recently. "Spending intentions for gifts declined 3% from a year ago, according to a survey of more than 4,000 respondents by Deloitte." This is no doubt due to increased costs, especially those arising from housing and soaring interest rates. In addition, U.S. professionals have little job and career stability and are under the threat of job loss due to layoffs and budget cuts. They are also forced to look elsewhere for work due to RTO mandates, and this combination of factors places restrictions on how American professionals are spending (or saving) their hard-earned salary. When your income flow is tight, it certainly helps to have something extra on the side so you can quickly bolster your salary, purchase thoughtful gifts for your loved ones, and enjoy the holidays relatively stress-free while giving yourself a healthy financial kickstart to the new year. These quick-start part-time remote job ideas should inspire you: If you have copywriting, SEO, marketing, design, or blogging experience, you can easily sign up and create a freelancer profile on Freelancer, Upwork, and Fiverr platforms. The process can usually be completed in a matter of hours, although in some instances, approval of your profile may take a little longer (up to a few days). There are hundreds of specialized services that you can provide on these platforms, and you can start bidding for projects immediately. If you have an eye for detail and a passion for grammar and language, why not make money from proofreading? You can hunt around and discover jobs at publishing companies, sites such as PaperTrue (not currently hiring, but keep an eye out), Scribbr, Scribendi, and, of course, freelance platforms and job boards such as Indeed. Cactus Communications, also known as Cactus Global, is hiring for remote freelance translator roles in multiple countries, covering languages including Japanese, Russian, Korean, Turkish, and Chinese. The company also has job listings for a freelance voice-over artist and a peer reviewer, which are included as part-time remote jobs, which you will need to apply for. Although it is unclear how long the process takes to start, this is just one example of many, of where you can utilize your bilingual skills to bring in extra cash. You can bid for translator work on the freelance platforms listed above as well. Affiliate marketing is when you have a URL to a company's product or service, and whenever someone clicks on your link and purchases, you receive a commission. With Amazon's Affiliate program, registering is pretty easy, and you can be up and running in no time. If you already have a blog or are very active on social media and generate a large following and engagement, this is the perfect way to continue talking about what you love, or even discussing your industry and business, while making money from mentions of any products. Gigs on freelance marketplaces are easy to apply for and you can even get hired the same day Each of these part-time remote job opportunities requires minimal set-up, and with a strategic marketing approach, you can maximize your enjoyment of the holiday season with friends and family.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The retail giant said it’s responding to a top request from its customers. The option is now available in six states and will expand nationally. Meeting a top demand voiced by its customers, Walmart on Tuesday said it is expanding same-day delivery to include prescription medications. Eventually customers will be able to get prescriptions delivered within hours or as soon as 30 minutes. The option is now available in six states — Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin — with plans to expand to 49 by the end of January. Under this program, customers can include prescriptions, grocery items or both for delivery. Walmart+ members, who pay a $98 annual fee for a variety of benefits, will receive free pharmacy delivery, while non-Walmart+ members pay $9.95. With the two major drugstore retailers in the U.S. in turmoil, Walmart is expanding convenience for its pharmacy customers, augmenting delivery services that the retail giant says reach 86% of households in the country. “Our extensive footprint across the nation combined with our deep expertise in pharmacy uniquely positions us to make a profound impact in the communities we serve," Kevin Host, senior vice president of pharmacy at Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “We understand that health care is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s hyper-local. Each community has unique needs. This new offering allows us to continue serving customers while also giving more time back to our pharmacies for high-touch health services.” The move is a response to a survey of customers Walmart conducted a couple of years ago, which found that 55% would like prescriptions included in their grocery deliveries and other online orders; this was the top request of “Walmart customers who self-identified as time-sensitive, busy families,” the company said in a blog post. Meanwhile, both Walgreens and CVS Health are downsizing. In a move to tighten its grip on expenses further, Walgreens last week said it will close 1,200 stores in the next three years. The company said its retail operations were a drag on its Q4 and full year results. In recent weeks CVS, also in the throes of cost-cutting, confirmed plans to lay off 2,900 employees. Both Walgreens and CVS have also shaken up their leadership over the last several months, with the latter replacing its CEO just last week. Walmart is also scaling back some health care options, however, saying earlier this year that, due to high operational costs, it will end its telehealth services and shutter all 51 health centers. Even Amazon, which has entered the pharmacy and health care business in part through acquisitions, recently confirmed hundreds of layoffs in those areas.

Title: How To Prevent A Mass Exodus During Return To Office

How to Prevent a Mass Exodus During RTO Amazon's recent five-day return-to-office (RTO) mandate has sparked significant employee discontent. This mandate shows the tension between companies and employees at the moment. The situation at Amazon reflects a trend across corporate America, a situation that must be addressed if business leaders want to retain top talent in today's market. Back in 2023, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy announced that his workers should return to the office for at least three days a week. Employees strongly resisted this at the time. Before workers had fully adjusted to the three-day mandate, Amazon tightened its RTO policy to five days a week. This has led to intense employee backlash and the potential for a massive exodus of talent. A memo from September 16 says Amazon will cut management layers and require employees to return to the office full-time. A recent survey done by Blind of 2,585 Amazon employees found that 73% of Amazon professionals are rethinking their jobs since the news broke. The survey goes on to note that 80% of employees knew a colleague considering leaving. The reason for considering a new role outside of Amazon is not far-fetched. The new RTO policy is less flexible, especially for parents and long-distance commuters. Amazon employees hope leaders will reconsider a policy effective in 2025, or they will quit. In December 2023, many Amazon Web Services workers resigned when the three-day RTO policy launched. With the updated five-day policy, we might see a spike in those numbers. Amazon's new policy shows the ongoing tension between leaders and employees today. Many organizations are still pushing for rigid RTO policies despite the discontent among the workforce. In fact, according to a survey done by Resume Builder in August, 87% of companies will have returned to office by 2025, with big companies like UPS, Boeing, and JPMorgan Chase leading the line. These larger organizations cite improved productivity, higher revenue, and a strong culture as drivers for RTO. But there's no clear data to track the effectiveness of these RTO policies. The new Amazon RTO policy has drawn criticism from employees. Some say the mandate was not done kindly or transparently. Some employees state they learned this new policy from a news article. When these things happen, workers lose trust in their leadership, and understandably so. The truth is Amazon’s in-office model has been in flux post-COVID. In fact, there have been cases of employees who were hired remotely in 2023 and are now being instructed to return to the office immediately. Fortune reports that most were promised work from home when they were hired, but now, they're forced to change their work-life balance to fit in or keep their jobs. On the other hand, it’s been reported that the RTO mandate has not been applied across all of Amazon’s subsidiaries. For example, Amazon's One Medical subsidiary will let employees work 3 days a week starting in October. This has caused more company-wide disputes. This new policy is creating friction not just with workers but also with global mandates, especially with the UK government's push for flexible working rights ahead of the holiday season. The UK government has actively promoted flexible work and argues remote work boosts performance and loyalty. In contrast, Amazon maintains that in-office work fosters better collaboration and innovation. For many employees, the return-to-office policies represent a substantial financial strain. A 2023 Owl Labs report found that full-time office workers now spend an average of $51 daily and $1,020 monthly to work full-time in the office, compared to $408 per month for hybrid workers. It's now more expensive to work from the office than in 2019. This does not include the time spent commuting to and from the office. Workers are skeptical of the motives behind RTO policies beyond the additional monetary cost. A MyPerfectResume study found that 77% of workers believe RTO policies give employers more control. 64% think their employers don't trust them to work from home. However, the real reasons may be more sinister. An emerging report says a quarter of VP and C-suite executives plan to use RTO mandates as a smokescreen to cut jobs and boost margins. Some industry observers have dubbed this strategy "back-channel layoffs." Additionally, corporate messaging says that RTO policies aim to boost collaboration and innovation. Yet, 22% of HR pros admit their firms lack the data to measure this. Without tracking, transparency, and KPIs, the consequences can be severe and directly impact a company's bottom line. For instance, 8 in 10 employers lost talent to return-to-office mandates, and the cost of replacing them is substantial. To avoid a mass exodus of employees like at Amazon, consider these strategies for a successful hybrid or flexible Return to Office (RTO) policy: Instead of implementing blanket mandates, engage your team in the decision-making process. This inclusive approach provides valuable insights. It also fosters a sense of ownership among employees. This increases their buy-in for the final policy. Conduct anonymous surveys or focus groups to understand individual circumstances and concerns. The pandemic has shifted employee priorities. Ford's global study found that 77% of employed individuals now value a balanced personal life over career advancement. Create flexible work options, like hybrid models or flexible hours. Balancing business needs with employee needs is a way to ensure both get met. As a leader, set clear benchmarks. Use tools to track productivity, collaboration, and employee satisfaction across work models. Consider metrics such as employee performance level, engagement scores, and retention rates, and use this data to refine your policies over time. With RTO costs rising, it's crucial to consider the financial impact on your team. Evaluate your compensation and benefits package holistically. Consider offering perks like commuter benefits, meal allowances, cost-of-living adjustments, and childcare or eldercare subsidies. Your leadership team's actions will set the tone for the entire organization. Ensure that company leaders adhere to the same RTO policies as other employees. Be visible and accessible in the office when you expect your team to be there. Publicly recognize teams and individuals who embody the company's new work culture. A survey of over 5,000 workers found that 95% say their emotional well-being impacts their productivity. Consider on-site counseling, local mental health provider partnerships, and mental health app subscriptions. Also, regular workshops on stress management, work-life balance, employee wellness, and self-leadership should be held. Train managers to recognize and support employees' mental health needs. Clear, consistent communication is key to successful policy implementation. Create a full communication plan for your RTO strategy. It should include: Q&A sessions to address concerns, anonymous feedback channels for input, and clear decision-making guidelines. Overwhelmingly, employees are experiencing distrust when it comes to the organizations they work for. Organizations are not handling their RTO policies in ways that keep in mind the fact that their employees are humans with other priorities and needs outside of the office. When delivering life-altering news to employees, it’s important to be transparent and holistic when considering how your organization treats its most vital resource: its people. One Community.

James L. McQuivey, PhD, VP, Research Director As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. Among our future of work predictions for 2025, we predict big risks and opportunities such as the following: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you. Read our full Predictions 2025: The Future Of Work report to get more detail about each of these predictions and read additional predictions.

Title: A Strange Trip Through the Violence of the Trump Era

Emily Witt’s favorite drug is acid—specifically between 75 and 100 micrograms two or three hours before leaving the house. It never causes a hangover, it lasts all night, and its effects can be amplified or dulled down with other drugs. On the right amount of acid, Witt feels happy to be around others, but not so delirious that she might mistake someone she doesn’t know for a friend. LSD is also a fairly straightforward drug, hard to lace with other, more risky chemical compounds, and thus relatively safe for human consumption. Besides, “as a straight white girl from the Midwest, the archetype of the nerdy midwestern acid freak … was an established role I could comfortably inhabit.” Witt discloses this preference halfway through her new book, Health and Safety, a memoir about love, work, and Brooklyn’s rave scene in the 2010s. In 2012, after she went off the antidepressant she had been taking for many years, she quit her full-time job at a newspaper and became a freelance writer. She was at work on her book Future Sex, but was already preparing to investigate another kind of hedonism. Before turning 30, Witt had been tentative about trying recreational drugs, worried about how they might interact with her dose of Wellbutrin. But after she stopped taking the medication, she felt free to experiment. After smoking DMT for the first time with a friend, Witt became fascinated by the concept of altered consciousness. “That this cognitive experience could be generated by the interaction of my brain with a chemical found in plants amazed me,” she explains at the book’s outset. “That our biology enabled us to trip could not be an accident. I wanted to understand more.” At first, Health and Safety appears to be, like Future Sex, an entertaining, provocative, first-person reported book about the subcultures surrounding a recreational activity. Health and Safety is not quite the scientific and cultural history that Michael Pollan offered in How to Change Your Mind; nor is it as experimental as fellow raver McKenzie Wark’s Raving, an informal, sometimes diaristic book that explains what it feels like to stave off gender dysphoria by letting loose on the dance floor. Witt has written something more expansive, borrowing elements of both genres. It is both a researched history of drugs and electronic music and a firsthand account of consumption and escapism. But it’s also an exploration of how one squares extended periods of partying with an otherwise conventional adult life—with its commitments to long-term partnership and full-time work. While Witt’s work sometimes covers the culture of drugs and dancing, she has also reported on pressing social and political issues: school shootings, police brutality, the alt-right. That work turns Health and Safety into something much more complex than a meditation on dancing and drugs. Namely, it is a book concerned with how people express their political frustration; how they take it out on others, and how they channel it into their everyday lives and personal relationships. When Witt sets out on her drug journey, she doesn’t “understand the point of being on a psychedelic at a bar or a party.” At first, her experimentation isn’t about meeting people, or immersing herself in music. Only later does the research swallow her whole. Eventually, the end of the workday and the start of the night become indistinguishable, even if she is closing her laptop and sliding on her sneakers. After trying DMT, she samples everything she can get her hands on: ayahuasca, acid, MDMA, magic mushrooms, ketamine. She reads books about drugs, learns about appropriate dosages and interactions, attends drug conferences, and goes to Burning Man. (This last one is a two-for-one research project, as the festival is an oasis known both for tripping and “consent tents.”) The drugs, at first, aren’t about meeting people, but inevitably she does. At the first ayahuasca ceremony she goes to in upstate New York, she meets an attractive guy named Matt who is really into mushrooms and self-help. She dates him for a couple years despite never really liking him that much, and their relationship is fading when she meets someone who, for the book’s purposes, she calls Andrew: a raver who makes music and organizes his life around partying. She and Andrew do drugs together and go to parties together. They fall in love, and he introduces her to a whole new set of ravers who go out in Brooklyn, upstate, and Berlin to dance to techno and house D.J.s. “My world oriented itself like a compass toward a magnet,” she writes of Andrew. “Toward his tastes, his friends, the social scene I wanted to inhabit.” But where the story really starts to gain traction and where the book’s subhed—“a breakdown”—begins to make sense is when Witt’s work as a journalist moves to the forefront and the partying fades into the background. In 2018, she interviews for a job at The New Yorker and is sent to Parkland, Florida, to write about the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Trump is president, the culture wars are heating up, and increasingly, she is covering what can only be described as “the violence beat.” She travels back to her hometown of Minneapolis, where an anti-Muslim activist interrupts an Ilhan Omar campaign event with her screams. She attends a Trump rally in Houston where supporters carry AR-15s and tell her that immigrants are “flooding into America to loaf, steal, and sell fentanyl.” She goes to Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse kills two protesters. She becomes immersed in dark stories that would keep any sane person up at night. Coming back to Andrew and her local joints in Bushwick allows her to “forget about America and its problems,” if only for a little while. These are the kinds of stories Witt is working on when Covid-19 hits Brooklyn, in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and the reignition of the Black Lives Matter movement across the country. The pandemic dramatically upends nightlife, taking away the community and outlet that ravers, Witt included, once had to blow off steam. D.J.s move into Zoom squares and stream their music on online platforms for fans, but “club music without the club was devoid of so much of its purpose.” The new slowness of life, however, also helps Witt come to the realization that her “most transcendent drug experiences were probably behind me” anyway. She thinks about leaving New York, and perhaps becoming a mother while she still can. Meanwhile, her work as a journalist is only becoming more important—and more frustrating to Andrew, who is depressed, disengaged, stung by the loss of his lifeline, and also a little resentful of Witt’s career. Journalists, he comments, “made their names by piggybacking on acts of violence and injustice.” It’s with this attitude that Andrew grudgingly joins Witt at a Black Lives Matter protest in the Bronx, where he is beaten up and eventually taken into custody by the cops. Witt, in a fit of panic, escapes the violence with her press pass. Everything goes downhill from here. Andrew is jolted into action after getting released from jail with minor injuries. He becomes fixated on the way that cops violated him. He starts researching policing strategies and decides he wants to order protective gear from Amazon. He has what turns out to be a manic break, and his resentment blooms into anger. As their relationship slowly falls apart, Andrew harasses her with text messages, reveals details about other women he’s slept with (they had an open relationship), threatens to change the locks on their apartment, calls her “a Karen” and “a cop,” and pees on the couch in her office. At one point, he becomes convinced that anyone who thinks he needs help—friends in their circle, his own mother—only thinks as much because Witt told them lies. He takes on a reactionary mode Witt describes as “a Trumpian logic.” All the while, she is trying to report on City Council meetings in New York and protests in Louisville. Adrenaline accumulates in this part of the book, as one begins to feel the nearly visceral way that violence comes to define Witt’s life at this moment, the dynamics of her relationship refracting the angry and emotional political climate. “The stagnation of the previous month,” she writes, “had been replaced by a new, vicious energy, and righteous political anger that I could not seem to sufficiently meet or respond to.” The sentence describes Andrew’s behavior after he is released from jail, but it could just as well characterize that peculiar moment in history, when social isolation, layoffs, and deaths from disease and political violence fed emotions and reactions at a rate too fast to appropriately calibrate in real time. On Twitter, Trump called Covid the “Chinese virus,” and his supporters followed with even worse slurs; in St. Louis, Patricia and Mark McCloskey pointed guns at protesters; and in Minneapolis, an anti-government collective called Unicorn Riot burned down the Third Precinct of the city’s police department. Trump and his supporters had primed the country perfectly for this zenith of anger, Witt suggests through the patterns of her own reporting. “I was writing the same story over and over; and recent history was mutating and becoming recombinant,” she writes. Kyle Rittenhouse replayed the vigilante violence of George Zimmerman, while the internet fostered a supercharged combination of Alex Jones and the homophobic hate group Westboro Baptist Church. In narrating Andrew’s descent into rage, Witt startingly captures the mood of the Covid years: a period when many took part in a mass competition to see who could be the most righteously outraged, each performing in a global morality pageant. “He spoke not with his own words but in the borrowed language of racism and trauma,” she writes of Andrew after he is released from jail and crowned with a newfound martyrdom. “Which in that time was the most unassailable language a person could deploy.” Andrew is frustrated by the system and his claustrophobia. Without a way to vent those feelings, Witt, with her “elite media job,” becomes a target. “Discarding me, had become, for him, an act of ideological purity,” she writes. “He had cast me as a stand-in for the failure of liberalism.” Andrew’s angry words get into her head, and force her to question her own conception of herself: “I was left to convince myself of the integrity of my politics, which I was incapable of doing, because of course I was culpable.” Andrew’s comments about her opportunism felt at points too obvious to be worth her energy. But, she allows, he “had national opinion on his side.” The conundrum raises the question of what we owe, as writers, to people when we are reporting on violence—physical, emotional, or otherwise. Is what journalists do in fact, as Janet Malcolm famously proposed, “morally indefensible”? Or, as Andrew seems to indicate, is a reporter just “ideal terrain” for “misguided virtue signaling”? The answer is not exactly clear, and finding it is not really Witt’s goal, either. For, after all, Health and Safety does not attempt to define stability, health, or safety. Rather the book is about striving for all those states of being in a tumultuous, difficult, and violent period. Dancing on drugs for 15 hours at a time may seem to some an irresponsible way to deal with reality. But when you revisit those unpredictable and dangerous moments of lockdown, the nightlife scene starts to look like one of the few places that still made sense.

Title: Why sticking to a rigid product roadmap might be killing your product, and how to escape?

In this article, Sapnil Bhatnagar, a technical product manager, shares his approach when developing a product roadmap and his own FLEX Roadmap Model. Sapnil is a Technical Product Manager specializing in Digital AI SaaS products, based in London, UK. With deep expertise in product strategy development, product vision and implementation through agile methodologies. Product development is evolutionary! New prioritization frameworks popping up every week, a new competitor feature that just launched, or an idea generated during your sweet nap time can hamper your ability to stick to a roadmap which was well crafted 6 months ago. To plan an escape from this vicious cycle and engage in re-prioritization we product managers can sometimes become too rigid with our product roadmaps, even becoming a cause of our own misery. Product roadmaps are often seen as the holy grail of planning and execution. They provide a sense of direction, help align teams, and give stakeholders a clear view of what's coming next. They serve as a guiding light for executive leaderships to manage and develop forecasts on resourcing and fill the funding winter if it comes! However, when product managers cling too tightly to these roadmaps, they risk stifling innovation, missing market opportunities, and ultimately, killing their product. This article explores why flexibility in product planning is crucial and presents a framework for striking the right balance between structure and adaptability. It's easy to understand why we product managers might be tempted to stick religiously to our roadmaps: However, in my experience, this rigidity comes at a significant cost. Let's examine the four key issues with rigid product roadmaps: Markets evolve rapidly. New competitors emerge, customer preferences shift, and technologies advance. A rigid roadmap can blind you to these changes, causing you to build features that may have been relevant when you planned them but are obsolete by the time they're released. During the course of my existing engagement in running a B2B product development, there was a radical shift in compliance requirements from the regulatory agencies, leading to accommodation of a critical reporting feature, if not done, it would have led to a big compliance risk. I acknowledged that if the product roadmap was not pivoted to cater to these immediate needs we may be looking at huge fines in a year’s time. Regulatory situations cannot always be forecasted; hence Product Managers are required to instrument their roadmap plan to accommodate uncertainties. Industry case study: Meta's horizon worlds (2022-2023) Meta (formerly Facebook) heavily invested in the metaverse (Zuckerberg’s new gig), particularly its virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, believing it to be the next big tech frontier, However, the market was misread, the product failed to align with current market demand and user expectations. Outcome: When teams are too focused on delivering pre-planned features, they may miss opportunities for creative problem-solving or breakthrough ideas that could dramatically improve the product. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, and rigid roadmaps leave little room for exploration. Though, being careful with innovation to not hamper the time to release is also important, it’s all about striking the right balance! Industry Case Study: Intel's Chip manufacturing delays (2022-2023) Intel, once a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, fell behind competitors due to delays in developing new chip technologies, Internal bureaucracy and a focus on existing technologies stifled innovation in advanced chip manufacturing processes. Outcome: Sticking to outdated plans means investing time and money into features that may not provide value. This inefficiency can be costly, especially for start-ups and small companies with limited resources. Case in point was my time at leading product development for a ML and data science augmentation project, where resources were being trained on-the-job, hence, sticking to training plans which were relevant to feature developments which were discovered and deemed relevant six months ago were no longer relevant and may even interject with productivity if followed. Industry case study: Amazon's Alexa division (2022) Amazon heavily invested in its Alexa voice assistant technology, believing it would drive significant revenue through voice shopping and other services, Though, the division struggled to monetize per projections leading to layoffs in the space. Despite having over 100 million Alexa-enabled devices sold, only a small percentage of users made purchases through voice commands Outcome: Talented product developers and engineers thrive on solving real problems. If they're forced to work on features they know are no longer relevant or valuable, it can lead to frustration and decreased motivation. Everyone likes to be creative at times, if the creative space is taken out of the metric, demotivation sulks in faster than expected! Industry case study: Twitter's mass layoffs and policy changes (2022-2023) Following Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the company underwent dramatic changes in leadership, policies, and workforce, with rapid policy shifts, mass layoffs, and public disputes in play, employee motivation went to an all time low, with flurry of organic and inorganic attrition. Outcome: To address these issues and implement solutions which can deliver quick fast and can scale, Over the years I developed my own FLEX Roadmap Model: F - Focus on outcomes L - Learn continuously E - Experiment rapidly X - X-ray vision (transparency) Let's explore each component of this model and how it can be implemented: Instead of detailing specific features months in advance, organize your roadmap around themes or high-level objectives. This approach provides direction while allowing flexibility in how you achieve your goals. The solution will become easier if you as a product manager can take proactive steps in coaching your leadership teams on Rolling-Wave planning. High level focus areas: Implementation: 1.1 Develop a high level view on product strategy 1.2 Compartmentalize your product strategy into product focus areas 1.3 Break product focus areas into product features 2.1 Proceed with Rolling wave planning as ideas on product features become clear 2.2 Start execution through ‘Feature driven development’ At some point we have all been hostages to a stringent deadline, immediate needs of accommodating priority and dry Microsoft Project Plans, dreading to update those plans and convincing executives on why the updates are not clearly documented can be taxing! Here, agile comes to your rescue! (Agile by design advocates continuous improvements and continuous feedback loops, Agile also promotes failing early, your Definition of Done can change and evolve, hence, keep making changes to your DoD as your product development continues and expands and you collect more and more feedback) Hence, as a product manager your starting point should be to create formal channels for collecting and analyzing customer feedback and enabling a smooth window to augment those feedbacks into your development, once you can achieve this, you will have a solid reasoning for ‘Why the plan needs to change?’ Always, make it a priority to incorporate customer input into your roadmap decisions and share the roadmaps as frequently as possible; Even better, set up a fortnightly, roadmap review call to maintain transparency, it has always worked flawlessly in my case, and there’s no reasoning why it shouldn’t work for yours! High level focus areas: Implementation: 3.1 Establish full scale Agile framework on your product delivery by advocating 3.2 Setup an achievable definition of done early on to avoid last minute surprises 4.1 Use metrics and dashboards to validate your product decisions focussing majorly on feature importance, feature touchpoints. 4.2 Ensure to develop these metrics in collaboration with your customers and product teams to capture the most accurate results. Intelligent fact: Do you know only 6% of the product features are actually ever used regularly by your customers as part of their customer journey? While sticking to pre-defined agenda and objectives is necessary, most value is created when teams experiment and fail. As a product manager I have always encouraged my team to run small experiments and develop alternate prototypes. Building a reward structure and healthy competition can lead to exceptional results, experimentation also helps validate assumptions before committing significant resources to a feature. (Try using Six Thinking Hats and 5 Whys concept to assess right experimentation and driving clarity) High level focus areas: Implementation: 5.1 Allocate specific time (~10%) in each sprint for your team to collectively brainstorm on ideas and refine generated ideas 5.2 Enable idea plotting to capture themes and pick top three ideas for implementation in subsequent delivery 6.1 Validate the implemented ideas through release in a small subset, thus enabling consumer experimentation 6.2 Swiftly discard unused ideas (features) which do not pull in positive outcomes (financial/user experience) within first 60 days I think 70% of the product manager’s job revolves around driving clarity, fostering clarity amidst uncertain and ambiguous environments is a mountain in itself. When the objective is unclear and ideas are floating all over the place, bringing in a structure and a ‘How to’ guide makes a huge impact! When you do need to adjust the roadmap, be transparent about the reasons with your team, drive transparency through guidelines by pointing towards the incremental value and enable collaborative sessions! (MIRO works best here) This will help stakeholders understand the value of flexibility, eventually augmenting your roadmap with achievable product's overall goals. High Level Focus Areas: Implementation: Step 7.1: Use custom or standard templates to conduct monthly product performance review focussing on user base and financial metrics Step 7.2: Close changes and document release notes formally month on month Release your product roadmaps in your product circle and consumer base enabling positive user experience and product acceptance It's important to note that abandoning structure entirely is not the answer. The key is to find a balance between providing direction and maintaining flexibility. While roadmaps are valuable tools for product development, they should be viewed as living documents rather than inflexible mandates. By embracing the FLEX Roadmap Model you're not just saving your product – you're setting it up to thrive in an ever-changing market landscape. Remember, the most successful products are often those that can adapt quickly to change. By loosening your grip on rigid roadmaps and implementing a more agile approach to product planning, you ensure that your product remains relevant, competitive, and truly valuable to your customers.

Title: Dear CTO: it's not 2015 anymore

Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:00:54Z

Engineers have been spoiled rotten for the last two decades. It’s the harsh - but objective - truth. Pre-2022, twenty-somethings regularly landed 6-figure jobs with nothing but a boot camp on their resumes. Big Tech employers offered unlimited PTO, ‘20% time’, and lavish benefits - ex: private gyms, gourmet cafeterias, and on-campus childcare. Job security was a given; recruiters constantly swarmed engineers with offers of more: better benefits, bigger salaries, and higher titles. If you were lucky enough to be considered tech talent, there was virtually no way to fail. You could get fired for your own incompetence and find a new role within weeks - with a better title and salary to boot. There was an ulterior motive behind all this. Engineers fueled the software boom. It was an advantage for Google to hoard 60,000 ICs. The point was not to put them all to work, but just to have them; it bought optionality while keeping critical resourcing away from their competitors. The downstream effect of this would transform engineering as a function. If you (like most companies) couldn’t afford the $350k price tag of a senior dev, you only had one option to attract top talent: Build a ‘great engineering culture’ In other words, a culture where engineers don’t need to do anything that they don’t want to do. Engineers don’t like politics, so product management transforms into a glorified mouthpiece, running interference and smoothing things over with unhappy stakeholders. Dev time is precious, so bureaucracy is put in place to ensure that requests are screened before engineers ever need to lift a finger. Developer sentiment surveys are distributed regularly to make sure that the tech team knows their feelings very, very important. No other function is run this way, but it’s business as usual for engineering. It was for good reason - retention was critically important; losing your ICs (who were constantly solicited by Big Tech recruiters offering them bigger and better) meant you might not be able to keep the lights on. Two decades of this arms race has birthed an extraordinary phenomenon: we have an entire generation of engineering leaders who think that hiring and retention is the point. They coddle rather than manage, disdain and avoid corporate politics, and fail to prioritize the bottom line. This isn’t universally true of all engineering leaders, but these norms pervade engineering culture. Engineering has operated under unique circumstances for so long that most CTOs have never experienced a ‘normal’ business environment. They think priorities can be set on trust and good faith. They mistake developer experience metrics for ‘productivity’ indicators. They think that the product team sharing a roadmap should be enough to explain what engineering is working on. They’ve been so hyper-focused on retaining their teams and staying alive that they’ve never had to justify their existence. But these leaders don’t realize that the days of focusing on retention are over. Software ate the world, and there’s no longer a point for Google to hoard 60,000 engineers. In 2023, Big Tech unceremoniously laid off 250,000+ workers and slashed benefits left and right. The promise of AI put the nail on the coffin: the party is over, and it’s not coming back. This transition is gearing up to be a painful one for CTOs and their teams. Their C-Suite peers are looking at the massive cuts organizations like Google and Amazon were able to successfully make and wondering if they could do the same. This wouldn’t be a problem in any other function; you don’t read about JetBlue making cuts to their marketing budget and immediately wonder if you could also cut your ad spend. But engineering has a unique problem because no one really knows what engineers actually do all day. I'm including this in a pull quote to re-emphasize how weird this is: most leaders have little to no visibility into one of their business's most expensive and important core functions. There are a couple of compounding factors that got us to this point. To start, engineering just isn’t widely understood as a function. In business school, you learn about product positioning and operations, but nothing about maintaining InfoSec as strategic infrastructure. There’s just no good way for non-technical leaders to build even a basic mental model of how enterprise engineering works. This makes conversations between technical and non-technical leaders uniquely painful. Virtually every conversation requires explaining foundational principles. Imagine if the CMO, before, during, and after a proposal on a routine ad campaign, needed to explain the concept of brand, why demand generation is important, and why we run ads. It’s so bad that most engineering leaders quietly handle routine engineering tasks behind the scenes. It’s much easier to just get their team through a major update than explain [common example of maintenance that non-tech person is likely to have never heard of]. This creates an us vs. them schism between engineering and virtually every other part of the business. Engineering feels (rightly) that they aren’t understood and appreciated. The rest of the business feels (rightly) that they’re dealing with a withholding, black box. Their conversations become increasingly hostile, to the point where engineering leaders - who were often raised in environments where it was perfectly okay to avoid things they didn’t like - stop trying to explain themselves at all. In many orgs, it’s product management that ends up picking up the slack. They act as a soothing balm - building bridges on engineering’s behalf and helping explain the what, why, and how behind engineering decisions. It’s no wonder that, when someone asks what engineering is doing, the answer is usually the product roadmap. This has become the norm for many companies. And this is why it’s going to hurt like hell for engineering leaders as they navigate this era of streamlining: Engineering leaders have never had control over their own narrative. Owning your narrative is essential to playing politics. Good narratives make goals feel natural and inevitable. They help leaders get everyone - not just those they manage - excited about achieving them. They provide air cover when things get tough and kudos when things go right. Engineering teams don’t have this. At best, they have a roadmap—a literal wishlist of things that product management would like them to do. This is why most CEOs have no concept of the life-preserving maintenance activities their engineering teams do every day. They don’t know when refactors happen and why. They don’t understand when bottlenecks occur because they don’t know where critical institutional knowledge is held. In short, they can’t see the work that engineers do. Engineering feels like an expensive, entitled black box that magically delivers features. This would be bad on its own, but nature abhors a vacuum. Engineering isn’t in the driver’s seat, but it still has a narrative. Engineers are socially inept nerds. Their work is cold, sterile, and binary. They don’t understand business and have no place in the boardroom. We can’t put them in front of investors and customers. They play foosball and drink beer all day. This is how people have come to see engineers. Imagine a head of support (who brings home $120k a year after two decades of leading call centers), watching a bunch of twenty-somethings play ping-pong at 4 p.m. Engineers might have been needed, but they were only barely tolerated. This is why FAANG making cuts has been such a galvanizing force for completely unrelated companies to begin layoffs of their own. People just can’t wait to believe that engineers aren’t so damn precious anymore. Enter the fierce debates we now see on ‘developer productivity’; they’re chomping at the bit to rightsize their engineering teams. This is the existential threat that CTOs now face. The scary thing is that most of them don’t even realize it - they’re still operating like it’s 2015, where the goal is hiring and retention. They’re strolling into conversations with their CFOs on ‘productivity’ with developer sentiment surveys in hand. Their teams are sitting ducks. It’s painful to watch. The irony of it all is that most engineering organizations outside of big-tech are already lean. Tech talent has been so expensive that most leaders outside of FAANG have learned to do a lot with very little. When over-eager business stakeholders make misguided cuts, they inadvertently put business continuity at risk by cutting core infrastructure. This infrastructure - and the developers who built it - enabled the prosperity of the software boom. Software engineers might have enjoyed extraordinary privilege along the way, but it was for a job well done. Take a look at Big Tech’s stock performance over the last two decades; you could easily argue that these workers deserved even more. Other functions would do well to bring the same kind of focus on enabling productivity, happiness, and autonomy to their workers. In fact, CTOs-turned-CEOs I know tend to be some of the most kind, creative, and abundance-minded leaders I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. They have an inherent understanding on the importance of culture and making people feel valued. But they - and their teams - won’t survive if they keep their heads in the sand. Just in this article, I probably made you feel all sorts of emotions about engineers. I did nothing to change your lived experiences; I just organized my thoughts, chose words carefully, and added necessary context. That’s the power of narrative. Good ones ring as truth because they help explain and reinforce our own experiences. That’s why it’s so important for engineering leaders to acknowledge that times have changed. If they don’t, it’s not just their teams and careers at stake - but the very continuity of the businesses they worked so hard to build. Are engineers a bunch of spoiled, overpaid geeks who were long overdue for a reckoning? Or are they the core infrastructure of revenue & innovation that we could all learn from? Whether or not CTOs choose to step up will make all the difference. After all, if you won’t write your story, someone else will. Godfrey helps CTO write their stories and bring people together. It tells the full story of what engineering teams do every day by visualizing maintenance, resourcing, and architecture in an easy, intuitive way. It’s Learn More A huge thank you to Matthew Casey, Sofia Hou, Mike Morreale, and Evan Kozliner for reading and proofing versions of this. I agree with a lot of what your article mentions. It does seem though that you think that the entire engineering population are just a bunch of spoiled overpaid 20 years-old with no developed communication skills since they didn't "need it". If this is the core point you are making then I am not sure if you are better than the average engineer that seems to think that everyone is stupid and not doing enough. While I agree that "creating a culture" was top-of-mind for CTO's in the "fatty years", I think there is a very important point that is not mentioned here. Hiring is a way of gaining power within an org. It is the prime and proven way to do exactly the "politics" the CTOs apparently "weren't doing enough of". What if we flip the idea here to "instead of trying to obtain influence and inflate headcount, CTOs should focus on building product and delivering value"? The "can you just use NORMAL WORDS" comment is a strange aside, and showing the person who wrote it in a very negative light. I know plenty of engineers who can use "normal worlds" alright, should anyone bother to actually listen. But the trend of the "fatty" years would be to prevent engineers from speaking to anyone because there was a thick (and thickening) layer of management which was laser-focused on usurping access to stakeholders. Personally, I think "the big shrink" will likely do very well by CTOs who can get back into the building mindset and the experienced engineers who will suddenly find themselves in a position where there is no insulating layer of middle management between them and the C-suite. Time will tell. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Why and How Lenovo Is Outpacing the Competition in AI
URL: https://www.technewsworld.com/story/why-and-how-lenovo-is-outpacing-the-competition-in-ai-179428.html
Time Published: 2024-10-21T12:00:13Z

On paper, Lenovo Group and Dell Technologies are remarkably alike, but the two companies are organized and run differently. That will become clear to most who compare last week’s Lenovo Tech World 2024 event to Dell’s similar event next month. At the heart of the difference is the nature of both companies’ acquisitions and executive leadership. Lenovo’s leadership is geographically diverse, making it a truly global company, while Dell’s is primarily centralized in the U.S. Although Michael Dell was instrumental in the company’s growth, he appears to have almost retired in place. Meanwhile, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, known as YY, is still a vibrant part of the company’s management. This difference allows Lenovo to move much more decisively on industry changes, while Dell appears unable to make big moves and has to undergo massive layoffs to make the same pivot to AI that Lenovo has already made. Another difference is the extent to which Lenovo is using AI. It’s already using AI operationally and selling mature AI solutions, while Dell still appears stuck on trying to sell a concept that the firm does not seem to know how to use yet. Dell’s marketing is doing a decent job of covering for these shortcomings, but the layoffs imply most customers are not fooled. Let’s discuss some of the highlights from Lenovo Tech World 2024. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, an interesting, mechanized laptop that Lenovo highlighted at the event. In the opening moments of an event like this, you can often see where a company’s heart and focus are. It might do something humorous or feature the leading offering, but occasionally, I am surprised, and this was one of those times. Lenovo opened with a demonstration featuring an individual with advanced ALS who cannot speak and can only move her eyes. But Lenovo had fashioned an AI solution for her so that, using AI, she could talk again. This breakthrough is monumental for individuals with ALS, enabling both speech and online interaction. This demonstration was incredibly powerful, and Lenovo followed up by covering what it’s doing for education with AI. Education is interesting because while it enormously impacts the world, the segment is not very profitable. Personalized learning for students using AI could be a massive benefit, as it should better engage those students and significantly increase the effectiveness of education across all demographics. Automated AI quizzes coupled with classes that teach using multiple AIs to create more compelling documents and reports should far better prepare students for the AI future than any other existing curriculum. Both things told me that Lenovo is more about making a difference than making a profit, which is incredibly important when talking about a technology that could eliminate many jobs. Lenovo made it clear that it is not working on AI to replace people but as a tool that would make students, people with disabilities, and employees more valuable rather than redundant over time. This approach stands in stark contrast to Dell’s recent AI-related layoffs. One of the more interesting offerings at the event was the Lenovo AI Library. Most companies are nowhere near as advanced as Lenovo in using AI. However, Lenovo’s journey to AI has created a massive amount of information. The company has now placed it in a library that can help its customers gain the insights they need to make informed AI solutions. Too many vendors are marketing AI as if it were an end in itself, similar to how digital transformation was once promoted rather than a tool to achieve specific business goals. This should ensure that Lenovo’s customers succeed while most other efforts are still, unfortunately, incurring significant failures. Where Lenovo stands out when it comes to these efforts is the blending of multiple AIs into a solution. Like people, AIs are not all equal and are best suited for the tasks they were designed to handle. However, many projects require diverse skills, often necessitating using multiple AI systems for successful completion. Lenovo’s hybrid AI approach is unique in recognizing this, offering greater real-world benefits and a higher likelihood of success. One example of this was the Lenovo AI paralegal. My wife and I are watching the old TV show “Suits,” which does a surprisingly excellent job of pointing out the critical nature of paralegals. These people are overworked, and much of what they do requires massive amounts of research, where a mistake can make the difference between winning and losing a case. Another powerful example was using AI for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy. Qualified ABA practitioners are expensive, and only relatively wealthy children have access to this type of therapy, which is increasingly critical given how much damage social media tools like TikTok are doing to them. The use of AI in this context could tremendously reduce the growing depression and behavioral problems today’s kids are suffering. Lenovo has long had a robust partnering culture. Most OEMs are at arm’s length from their technology suppliers, and our industry is famous for vendor conflict. Lenovo collaborates surprisingly closely with its suppliers, which has paid dividends in the past with workstations. Lenovo uniquely adopted AMD’s Threadripper and almost immediately took workstation leadership. Today, Lenovo’s closeness with Nvidia is what has paid off. Lenovo showcased what is arguably the best Nvidia Blackwell solution, which is cooled with Lenovo’s 6th-generation warm-water cooling technology, Neptune. Blackwell is incredibly powerful but also uses a lot of power and generates a great deal of heat. Neptune cools the part cost-effectively, which addresses two of the shortcomings associated with a part in this class. Neptune is today’s most widely used and efficient cooling technology for data centers. Over a decade ago, Dell predicted at Dell World that robotics would become the next big thing for enterprises. Autonomous vehicles have since emerged as the leading class of autonomous robots, with other types of robots also developing. This year, Lenovo reinforced this idea by showcasing current solutions, while Dell has yet to follow through on its prediction. Working with Nvidia, Lenovo showcased a Blackwell-based drive solution for cars with 2000 TOPS (Trillions or Tera Operations per Second). High-performance AI PCs have only 40 TOPS. Dell looked at doing this over five years ago but never executed a growing problem with that company due to a lack of clear leadership and willingness to take critical risks. Lenovo also highlighted its version of the autonomous robotic dog. Other firms have advanced robotic dogs, but Lenovo is the first in its class to do this.

Occasionally, an OEM surprises me, but I’ve been disappointed by how companies like Dell have approached AI sales and deployment to date. Many are not yet using AI extensively themselves and, as a result, lack the understanding needed to drive successful implementations. Lenovo, however, isn’t just pushing AI; it’s offering complete AI solutions — from education to robotics — positioning itself and its customers for the future of AI. For me, it was the work in education that I found to be the most compelling. Technology is doing massive harm to kids now, and we need to prioritize technological solutions to address this critical problem. I found a kindred heart in Lenovo; its focus here could save many kids from uncertain futures. (Photo by Author) I typically put products you can buy in this section, but I was so impressed with this concept that I am making an exception this week. I have an expensive automotive hobby, and I often watch videos on how to do this while working on my cars. The problem is that seeing the screen as I move around the vehicle usually requires that I reposition the tablet or PC several times, but my hands are greasy and can make a mess of that hardware, not to mention that there are times when my hands are otherwise engaged. The ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept looks like a regular laptop, but the screen rotates to follow you around the room. So, if you are cooking, working on a project (like a car), or otherwise moving around, the screen automatically moves to follow you. This demo video is pretty cool: One of the Amazon Alexa versions did this a few years ago, and I found it incredibly useful, but the device always had to be plugged in. Plus, Alexa’s capabilities limited it, and since Alexa isn’t a PC, it couldn’t access the videos I wanted to watch. The PC that Nvidia is secretly working on will take this concept further (and may not even need an OS like Windows), but the ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept comes closer to what I think it will be than anything else I have seen. This thing is awesome, so it’s my Product of the Week. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

Canada needs rigorous, deeply reported independent journalism now more than ever. Go to canadaland.com/join to become a yearly Canadaland Supporter today and get three months of perks and benefits for free. You can't really call Regina a news desert. They still have a newspaper. But if you actually look under the hood you’ll discover that they stopped printing the newspaper in Regina. They stopped editing it in Regina. The editor lives somewhere else. And as far the CBC goes, well, that acronym is now synonymous with layoffs. Everyone from the legacy media who purports to be telling people in Regina what is going on in their own community is doing so with less resources than ever before. These are zombie news organizations. That creates a news vacuum. A place for someone new to step in. And somebody did. And that somebody peddles garbage. That's not a value judgment of this new news source in Regina. It's just the objective truth. They're a garbage company called Just Bins. They provide dumpsters and news to the people of Regina. And they may be providing news to more people in Regina than anyone else.
