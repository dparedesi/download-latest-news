Plus, Amazon employees consider weighing quitting following RTO announcement. Plus, Amazon employees consider weighing quitting following RTO announcement. Greetings, comms pros! Let’s take a look at a few news stories from the last week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Tony Vinciquerra announces plans to step down A change at the top of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is underway, as CEO Tony Vinciquerra is slated to give up the company’s reins at the beginning of next year. SPE’s Chairman of Global Television Studios, President and COO Ravi Ahuja will take over on January 2, 2025, with Vinciquerra staying on in an advisory role until December 2025. Vinciquerra told Deadline that Ahuja will be a great fit for the role and shared a note of gratitude. “He has very good EQ and IQ. He’s much smarter than I am. And much better with people than I am. When I stepped into this role seven and a half years ago, I would’ve never imagined the extraordinary industry disruption and opportunity we’d face,” said Vinciquerra. “I’m filled with immense gratitude for this exceptional company and its profound legacy in Hollywood history. I’m consistently inspired by my brilliant and resolute colleagues.” No matter the company’s size, a change at the top is a big event to contend with. SPE handled this smoothly amid a changing entertainment landscape by making a runway for the change to take place and identifying a transition period for Vinciquerra. By emphasizing continuity, there’s a better chance for a smooth transition that keeps work and culture intact. 2. Longshoremen union speak out about strike Port workers across the country are continuing their strike over compensation and automation concerns, with representatives for the International Longshoreman’s Association claiming that their actions are meant to benefit “future generations.” According to The Guardian: Joe Mosquera, a crane operator and union organizer with ILA, local 1235, said its goals were straightforward. “The action is going to give us a fair contract and we can get back to work to get people the goods they need,” he said. “This is for our future generations. To keep automation out is to keep our jobs for the future. And if anything becomes automated, we want to make sure that there’s a worker to back it up.” The ILA has not had a new contract for six years. “We honored our last contract,” said Mosquera, “even through Covid when we had to work double or triple. We never shut down, so everybody could get their goods. We didn’t ask for a pay raise. We didn’t walk out to try to get leverage when we could have, because we were honoring our agreement.” In a world in which employee experience is becoming a more crucial part of employer communications, these strike actions bear watching. A major part of the strike centers on automation, which recalls memories of the WGA strike from last year. When workers don’t feel like organizations consider them or their needs and push for automation without any regard for their livelihoods, these situations get sticky and can drag out. For comms pros, there are three main things they need to do amid a unionization push or strike: Organizations derive identities from the people who work for them. Being able to relate to workers and provide them with what they need to succeed begins with acknowledging and talking to them. 3. Amazon employees threaten to quit over RTO mandate A few weeks ago, Amazon decided to call its corporate workers back to the office full-time beginning in January 2025. A recent survey from Blind found that Amazon employees aren’t taking the mandatory badge swipe lightly. According to Blind: “Just days after the company’s announcement, some Amazon professionals said they plan to take more drastic steps, including looking for another job. Nearly three out of four Amazon professionals (73%) said they are considering looking for another job because of the in-office work policy.” Returning to the office is totally fine as a policy, but it needs to be rooted in both company culture and sound reasoning. This is much different than calling people back to their desks because a company is falling behind on an ill-timed office lease — it communicates the ‘why’ behind the move through a shared sense of organizational values. In the absence of that “why”, you leave a void that causes people to speculate. In this case, Stanford economist and remote work expert Nicholas Bloom said that requiring employees back five days a week might be a way of conducting layoffs on the sly. Business Insider reports: Bloom told Business Insider that requiring employees to work in the office five days a week could be a “backdoor layoff” strategy — a move sometimes used by employers to reduce head count without facing the consequences of formal layoffs. He said the move would probably succeed on that basis but would “damage areas like AI where it is hard to recruit top employees.” “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” he said. Whether true or not, that idea is now out there and detrimental to the company’s employer brand. Though Simon Sinek’s “Start With Why” talk is standard issue thought leadership at this point, his wisdom rings true: people don’t buy what you do, but why you do it. 4. How about some good news?

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said. The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet. He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg. The lawyers said the mine’s filings with the South African government’s regulatory agency that listed Pienaar as a director were incorrect and should be “viewed as suspect” because news reports indicated the agency has been hacked. Pienaar filed a defamation lawsuit last year against an Associated Press reporter who sought interviews with Pienaar’s former associates. The AP said the suit, which remains pending, was meritless and an attempt to stifle legitimate reporting. Not long after Alexander rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2021, IronNet’s stock price soared, making its founders and early investors extremely wealthy on paper. Top officials were prohibited from unloading their stock for several months, but Alexander was allowed to sell a small amount of his shares. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. IronNet was projecting exponential growth that required the company to land a handful of major contracts, according to confidential board documents obtained by the AP. Those prospective deals included one valued at up to $10 million to provide cybersecurity for the U.S. Navy’s contractors and a more than $22 million deal with the government of Kuwait. It did not take long for IronNet’s promises to slam into a tough reality as it failed to land large deals and meet revenue projections. Its products simply didn’t live up to the hype, according to former employees, experts and analysts. Stiennon, the cybersecurity investing expert, said IronNet’s ideas about gathering threat data from multiple clients were not unique and the company’s biggest draw was Alexander’s “aura” as a former NSA director. The AP interviewed several former IronNet employees who said the company hired well-qualified technicians to design products that showed promise, but executives did not invest the time or resources to fully develop the technology. When IronNet tried to land contracts with the NSA, officials dismissed the company’s offerings as unserious, according to a former member of U.S. Cyber Command who was at the meeting but not authorized to discuss government procurement proceedings publicly. The failure to win large contracts quickly derailed IronNet’s growth plans. In December 2021, just a few months after going public, IronNet downgraded its annual recurring revenue projections by 60%. Another sign that things were not well: IronNet and C5 were engaging in a questionable business practice in an apparent effort to juice the cybersecurity firm’s revenues, according to C5 records and interviews with former employees at both firms. In addition to being a major investor, C5 was also one of IronNet’s biggest customers, accounting for a significant part of the cybersecurity firm’s revenue when it went public. C5 had signed two multi-year customer contracts with IronNet for $5.2 million, according to internal C5 records. Contracts of that size were typical for large clients with thousands of employees, not a small investment firm like C5 that had a couple dozen employees and partners, former IronNet employees said. “That’s an inflated number,” said Eddie Potter, a former top sales executive at IronNet, when told by the AP of the size of C5’s contracts with IronNet. He added there was “no way” that C5 required services “worth $5 million.” Indeed, one C5 internal record obtained by the AP shows it budgeted only about $50,000 a year for IronNet’s services. Pienaar’s attorneys said C5’s contracts with IronNet were to help protect the U.K. government’s hospitals and other entities against “escalating cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.” His attorneys said the work was coordinated through a charity Pienaar and C5 created in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and C5 records show C5’s contracts with IronNet were signed in the summer and fall of 2019 — several months before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Pienaar’s attorneys said Alexander and Pienaar were “briefed on the shocking scale of hostile nation-state cyberattacks on hospitals" in 2019, which created the “foundation” for IronNet’s work with C5. Pienaar’s charity never registered with the IRS, as one of Pienaar’s companies claimed in U.K. business filings, and former C5 and IronNet officials said they did not see it do any substantive work. “It was marketing, fluffy crap,” said Rob Mathieson, a former IronNet vice president. Pienaar’s attorneys said his charity was successful but there was “insufficient time” for it to register with the IRS. After reporting millions in revenue from C5 from 2020 to 2023, IronNet wrote off $1.3 million from C5 in what the cybersecurity firm claimed was “bad debt,” IronNet’s filings with the SEC show. Pienaar’s attorneys said the write-off represented a reduction in the cost of providing services to his charity and denied that C5 had not fulfilled its financial obligations to IronNet. IronNet was not alone in having trouble getting money from Pienaar and his firms. A group of nuns sued C5 in 2022, court records show, alleging it failed to return their $2.5 million investment in a tech incubator that Pienaar had promoted as a way to boost socially conscious start-ups. C5 agreed to refund the nuns’ investment, plus attorney fees and expenses, to settle the lawsuit, records show. The nuns’ financial adviser, Carolyn LaRocco, told the AP that Pienaar used the nuns’ investment to pay expenses she believed were unwarranted. An affiliate of the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit established by Congress, sued Pienaar in 2020 after he failed to pay a promised $1.5 million personal donation, federal court records show. The nonprofit’s affiliate then took Pienaar back to court after he failed to make payments on time as part of a settlement. Pienaar used $500,000 from a C5 bank account to meet a court-ordered deadline for payment, court records show. C5 staff were concerned about Pienaar’s use of the firm’s funds to cover his personal debt, according to C5 records. In the last year, Pienaar-controlled entities have been sued by a top former CIA executive who alleged C5 owed him back wages and a Washington landlord who accused Pienaar’s firms of failing to pay more than $140,000 in rent and associated costs. The suits were dismissed soon after they were filed, indicating the parties likely settled, court records show. A lawsuit recently filed by a financial services firm alleges C5 owes it more than $1 million in unpaid debts. After slashing revenue projections in December 2021, Alexander tried to project confidence and said IronNet was still on track to see its revenue rise. It didn’t work. IronNet’s stock went into a prolonged skid and the company underwent multiple rounds of layoffs. In April 2022, the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit from investors who alleged IronNet had fraudulently inflated its revenue projections to boost its stock price. The company has denied any wrongdoing but recently agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle the lawsuit, according to a proposed settlement filed in federal court. Alexander told Bloomberg News this past January that IronNet’s troubles stemmed in part from his naivety about how the business world worked. C5 began loaning money to IronNet to keep it afloat starting at the end of 2022 while Pienaar continued to try and boost the company’s brand. In September of last year, IronNet announced it had run out of money and was closing its doors. A Pienaar-controlled entity stepped in shortly afterwards with $10 million in loans to allow the company to restructure via bankruptcy. A dramatically scaled-down version of IronNet led by Pienaar’s allies went private in February and announced Alexander had stepped down as chairman of the board. Pienaar remains bullish on the company, which he said continues to successfully protect clients in the U.S. and Europe from cyber threats. IronNet’s more recent activities have included looking to partner with the government of Ukraine. “Any accusation that IronNet has been anything other than successful is categorically false,” his attorneys told the AP. Many of C5’s investors and former employees are baffled by Pienaar’s continued heavy bets on IronNet after it has been soundly rejected by the market. During bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year, an investment bank approached 114 prospective buyers for IronNet, federal court records show. None of them made an offer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Collapse of national security elites' cyber firm leaves bitter wake

IronNet, a cybersecurity startup, had promised it would combat hackers using a unique blend of expertise and software WASHINGTON -- The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health. IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin. “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud. IronNet’s collapse ranks as one of the most high-profile flameouts in the history of cybersecurity, said Richard Stiennon, a longtime industry analyst. The main reason for its fall, he said: “hubris.” “The company got what was coming to” it, Stiennon said. IronNet and top former company officials either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s founder and former CEO Keith Alexander is a West Point graduate who retired as a four-star Army general and was once one of the most powerful figures in U.S. intelligence. He oversaw an unprecedented expansion of the NSA’s digital spying around the world when he led the U.S.’s largest intelligence agency for nearly a decade. Alexander, who retired from the government in 2014, remains a prominent voice on cybersecurity and intelligence matters and sits on the board of the tech giant Amazon. Alexander did not respond to requests for comment. IronNet’s board has included Mike McConnell, a former director of both the NSA and national intelligence; Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Army vice chief of staff, and Mike Rogers, the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who is running for the U.S. Senate in Michigan. One of IronNet’s first presidents and co-founders was Matt Olsen, who left the company in 2018 and leads the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Alexander’s reputation and the company’s all-star lineup ensured IronNet stood out in a competitive market as it sought contracts in the finance and energy sectors, as well as with the U.S. government and others in Asia and the Middle East. IronNet marketed itself as a kind of private version of the NSA. By scanning the networks of multiple customers, the company claimed, IronNet’s advanced software and skilled staff could spot signals and patterns of sophisticated hackers that a single company couldn’t do alone. The company dubbed the approach the “Collective Defense Platform.” Venture capital firms were eager to invest. Among IronNet’s biggest early boosters was C5 Capital, an investment firm started and run by Andre Pienaar, a South African who had spent years serving the needs of the ultra-rich while cultivating business relationships with former top national security officials. C5’s operating partners – essentially expert advisers — include former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and Sir Iain Lobban, who used to lead the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency equivalent to the NSA. Former C5 operating partners include National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr. and Ronald Moultrie, who resigned earlier this year as undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. Prior to going into venture capital, Pienaar was a private investigator and started a firm called G3 Good Governance Group whose clients included blue chip companies, wealthy individuals and the British royal family. Pienaar also worked at the time to help Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg cement relationships with London’s rich and famous, according to William Lofgren, a former CIA officer and G3 co-founder. “The relationship was steady and frequent because both Andre and Vekselberg saw merit in it,” said Lofgren. Pienaar also helped Vekselberg win a share of a South African manganese mine in 2005 and then later served as one of the oligarch’s representatives on the mine’s board of directors until early 2018, internal G3 records and South African business records show. Vekselberg has been sanctioned twice by the U.S. government, first in April 2018 and again in March 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department has accused him of taking part in “soft power activities on behalf of the Kremlin.” In 2014, the FBI publicly warned in an op-ed that a Vekselberg-led foundation may be “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research.” Pienaar’s long association with Vekselberg should have disqualified him from investing in IronNet, which was seeking highly sensitive U.S. defense contracts, former intelligence officials said. The company’s leaders “absolutely should have known better,” said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer. He added that Russian intelligence services would have had a strong interest in a company like IronNet and have a history of using oligarchs like Vekselberg to do their bidding, either directly or through witting or unwitting proxies. Pienaar also sponsored a swanky Russian music festival that Vekselberg and a close associate, Vladimir Kuznetsov, put on in Switzerland. Kuznetsov, who served as a key investment adviser to Vekselberg, was also an investor in Pienaar’s investment firm. Alexander and others at IronNet either did not know the details of Pienaar’s relationships with Vekselberg or did not find them troubling: A month after Vekselberg was first sanctioned in 2018, Pienaar joined IronNet’s board and C5 announced it was putting in a $35 million investment. C5’s investment would grow to $60 million by the time IronNet went public, giving the investment firm around a 7% stake in the company. Vekselberg did not respond to requests for comment. Kuznetsov told the AP he stopped speaking to Pienaar about five years ago but did not say why. “I’m not commenting on that,” Kuznetsov said. Pienaar’s attorneys said he has never had a relationship with Vekselberg.

Title: TikTok Search, But It’s Going For Amazon; Can CTV Supply Outpace Demand?

Here’s today’s AdExchanger.com news round-up… Want it by email? Sign up here. Search High And Low TikTok announced this week that it would allow search advertising to be targeted by keyword. Previously, advertisers targeted specific audiences or types of audiences, but not actual search terms. TikTok’s growing search ad business is often framed as part of the overall threat to Google’s dominance. But TikTok search is part of a much sharper rivalry between the social media network and Amazon, according to Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. It is hard to square the heated rivalry between Amazon and TikTok with the companies’ recent advertising partnership. They’re often direct competitors, not complementary, and each is fighting hard to be the place for product discovery. Amazon and TikTok may be reluctant to give the other a leg up, but both want what the other has. Amazon needs targeted shopping supply and social media engagement; TikTok needs users to habituate themselves to purchasing on the platform. Amazon derives a huge advantage from the TikTok integration, since Amazon owns the customer and purchase data. TikTok gets another demand source, but as Amazon gets better and better at converting TikTok ad impressions to sales, TikTok earns no cut of the sales growth. As Seen On CTV Once upon a time, streaming was the shiny object of the ad industry. Now, ad supply outpaces demand, Ad Age reports. Part of that mismatch is due to media companies creating ad inventory seemingly out of thin air. Amazon will increase the rate of ads on Prime Video, while new placements like pause ads and home screen ads are spawning across streaming and smart TV services. Perhaps more importantly, media buyers remain disgruntled with the lack of pricing and measurement consistency. While the cost of cable TV is fairly consistent across the board (dayparts aside), streaming services launch ads with sky-high CPMs, then seemingly roll back prices at random. Plus, measurement is out of whack. Publishers still can’t agree on whether to sell and measure media based on GRPs or impressions, or what counts as premium inventory. Paired with the chronic lack of transparency in streaming buys, advertisers don’t necessarily see streaming as worth the cost and effort compared to cross-platform buys, one agency exec says. Considering CTV’s growing pains, it’s no wonder why buyers plan to spend more on social video than streaming this year. Going DEI-Free Pushy right-wingers aren’t the reason DEI programs are disappearing – or at least, not the only reason, Adweek reports. Shortly after the George Floyd protests in 2020, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives became a popular way for brands, agencies and vendors to address concerns from consumers and employees about racial inequality (and to look good in the process, a more cynical onlooker might say). Although DEI-related job postings increased a whopping 123% that year (per Indeed), not even two years later those jobs were already getting slashed in layoffs, NBC News reported. And now several major companies – including Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson – have publicly downscaled or even dropped their DEI initiatives. Conservative activists online would seem to be the most obvious instigating force here. But Adweek posits that last year’s Supreme Court decision against affirmative action had a more chilling effect, even though it only technically pertained to college admissions. Regardless, one thing seems pretty clear to both pro- and anti-DEI onlookers: None of these companies was that committed to the idea in the first place, if they were willing to flip so quickly. But Wait, There’s More! Apple Search Ads expands to Turkey and 20 additional countries. [9to5Mac] Amazon’s new shopping chatbot refuses to suggest “dupes,” aka off-brand facsimiles of luxury products. [Business Insider] The EU Commission has issued formal information requests to YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat about their content recommendation algos.

Title: From Layoffs To Love Lost: Why Job Loss Can Lead To Divorce And How To Avoid It

Loss of a job can increase the likelihood of divorce You’ve likely seen the headlines about looming job cuts, which are leading to 70% of U.S. workers to proactively prepare for the potential layoffs, according to a recent survey. And while it’s obvious that losing your job can be stressful, what you may not realize is that job loss is ranked as one of life’s most challenging experiences, so much so that some studies report losing a job can be more stressful than getting a divorce or even receiving a long-term illness diagnosis. Beyond the financial impact of getting laid off, it can take a serious toll on emotional health, self-worth, and even personal relationships. For those who’ve experienced a recent layoff, it’ll come as no surprise that it can affect your relationship—what is less talked about is that job loss is linked to increased rates of divorce. This correlation is complex to say the least and involves a mix of financial, emotional, and identity-related factors that create strain on a relationship, often in ways that may act as a knock-out blow to your marriage, partnership, or romantic relationship. For women, who juggle multiple responsibilities and face societal expectations around being a source of nurturing-stability, the impact of job loss can be feel even more intense. The last thing you want to after you’ve lost your job is to lose your support system too, so let’s break down why it feels so apocalyptic when you get axed and what you can do to safeguard your marriage, or partnership, in the wake of its wrath. While experiencing the end of a marriage is incredibly difficult, studies have shown that individuals tend to eventually return to their previous level of well-being after such event. If you really think about it, divorce often provides some level of closure, allowing those involved to eventually heal and move on. However, the emotional and psychological impact of losing your job may linger inevitability, and can feel even more overwhelming if you’re in a specialized field or had a high-level role, which on average have fewer opportunities and take significantly longer to replace. The uncertainty around job loss is what makes it so hard for couples to deal with. It can create a prolonged period of feeling “stuckness,” with no clear end in sight. So, unlike a breakup or divorce, where you may regain a sense of autonomy and direction, the helplessness that can come from searching for a new job creates an ongoing sense of instability. It’s that uncertainty which causes tension and could lead to the employed partner resenting the unemployed partner for not contributing financially—which could trigger feelings of worthlessness or failure, adding further strain on the relationship. Set Realistic Expectations Together: Sit down with your partner to discuss a plan. Setting realistic expectations around the job search timeline, budget adjustments, and how to support each other can alleviate the anxiety of uncertainty. Aligning your expectations will help you both navigate this period without placing undue pressure on your relationship. One of the most obvious effects of losing a job is the financial strain that comes with it, and the loss of one income can lead to an immediate sense of imbalance. When bills pile up and expenses outweigh income, a scarcity mindset can lead to arguments, resentment, and fear. Then, once that financial foundation begins to crack, it’s easy for both partners to start blaming one another and when that happens, you’re no longer trying to solve the problem as a team, but rather turning on one another and intensifying the tension and panic. It may be no surprise then that debt and financial stress are of the most cited reasons for divorce, with research finding that 54% of people believe them to be valid to consider divorce—and job loss can amplify it tenfold. The pressure to "make ends meet" can quickly turn into tension and conflict, with both partners feeling unsupported or misunderstood. Create a New Financial Plan Together: Review your finances and create a new budget that reflects your current reality. Openly discussing finances can help prevent misunderstandings and resentment. This also allows you both to find ways to cut costs and avoid debt, reducing financial stress and strengthening your bond. If you have a financial advisor/planner, it’s a great idea to get with them and get a true understanding on if there’s any immediate need to panic, or if you have some time before you need avoid Amazon and Target like the plague. A job is much more than a paycheck—it often provides a sense of identity, self-worth, and purpose. For many, career success is closely tied to feelings of confidence, respect, and stability. When you lose your job, you may feel like you’ve lost an essential part of yourself. This is especially true in our society which places such a high value on productivity and professional achievement. For women, whose identities are often interwoven with various roles—professional, caregiver, partner—job loss can feel like a personal failure, even if the circumstances were beyond their control. The loss of a job can trigger deep emotional responses, including shame, anxiety, and depression, all of which can negatively affect relationships. Some signs you might be struggling include becoming withdrawn, irritable, or overly dependent on your partner for validation. The resulting emotional strain can create distance, making it harder for your partner to connect with you. Over time, the disconnect can widen, leading to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction for both partners. Reconnect with Your Identity Outside of Work: To preserve your sense of self-worth, invest time in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your career. Whether it’s taking up a hobby, volunteering, or spending time with friends, these pursuits can help you maintain a sense of identity and purpose, reducing the emotional toll of job loss. Communicate Openly with Your Partner: Share your feelings about the job loss with your partner, including any fears or insecurities you have. Being vulnerable can foster empathy and understanding, helping to maintain emotional intimacy and ensuring your partner knows how to support you. While losing your job can feel like a crisis, certain factors can help alleviate the stress and mitigate the risk of damaging your relationship. Understanding what might help can be the key to surviving this challenging period together. Support from Family and Friends: Having a strong support network can make a significant difference and leaning on them can help reduce the pressure on your relationship by not relying solely on your partner for comfort. Living in an Area with High Unemployment: This may sound counterintuitive, but if unemployment is high in your area, it can normalize your experience and reduce feelings of shame or inadequacy. The shared experience can help you feel less isolated and reassure both you and your partner that the situation is not a reflection of your abilities or worth. Having an Extroverted Personality: Extroverted individuals tend to reach out for help and support more readily, which can be a crucial asset when dealing with job loss. If you’re naturally inclined to seek out social connections, it can help you stay positive and motivated. For those who are more introverted, making an intentional effort to connect with others can provide similar benefits. The loss of a job is undoubtedly a significant stressor, but it doesn’t have to lead to the end of your relationship. By being proactive, communicating openly, and making decisions together, you and your partner can navigate this difficult time as a team. Remember, your worth is not determined by your employment status, and your relationship can thrive even in the face of financial or emotional challenges. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: US Layoffs Up 53 Percent in September From Previous Year

Friends Read Free New data show that while employers handed out fewer pink slips in September than in August—when the number was at a five-month high—layoffs were up significantly compared to a year ago. According to recruitment firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, U.S.-based employers announced nearly 73,000 job cuts in September. While this was down by 4 percent from the previous month’s 75,891, the layoffs were up by 53 percent from last year. In the first nine months of 2024, personnel reductions rose by 0.8 percent year-over-year, to 609,242, surpassing in September the prior year’s running tally for the first time this year. This is the highest level since 2020, when more than 2 million layoffs were announced between January and September. Sizable portions of the year-to-date layoffs were centered in technology (116,858), entertainment and leisure (31,054), education (25,285), transportation (25,263), and manufacturing (19,794). These numbers have risen substantially from the same span in 2023. The Challenger report highlighted cost-cutting, business closures, and artificial intelligence as the top reasons for job cuts. “We’re at an inflection point now, where the labor market could stall or tighten,” said Andrew Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president. “Layoff announcements have risen over last year, and job openings are flat.” So far this year, employers have announced plans to hire close to 484,000 positions, down by 33 percent from 2023. Researchers say this is the lowest year-to-date hiring data since 2011. Labor market conditions could be stimulated in the coming months as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, and consumer spending is expected to rise, Challenger said. That said, layoffs continue to hit the headlines. Still, the JOLTS report showed an unexpected jump in job vacancies, topping 8 million for the first time since May. “This noisy indicator is starting to suggest a stabilization of the job market as the Fed pivots,” Adams stated in a note, as viewed via email by The Epoch Times. “Relatively few workers are being fired or laid off, and few are leaving jobs voluntarily for other opportunities, either.” Adams noted that the economy faces many near-term headwinds that will affect next month’s figures. “The impact of Helene and the strike also will likely affect October’s retail sales, industrial production, and jobless claims data, making the economy’s trend harder to tease out in the late fall months,” he said. Scores of retailers have been ramping up their seasonal hiring plans. Amazon, for example, announced on Oct. 3 that it will hire 250,000 workers for the year’s busiest shopping period. Last month, Target said it plans to hire about 100,000 seasonal employees. Macy’s said it will fill more than 31,500 full- and part-time seasonal positions. UPS aims to hire 125,000 seasonal workers ahead of Christmas. Companies are bracing for solid consumer demand. Sales for the 2024 Christmas shopping season are projected to increase by as much as 3.3 percent from 2023, according to Deloitte. Between November and January, holiday sales are expected to total $1.58 trillion to $1.59 trillion, Deloitte predicts. Adobe forecasts that e-commerce sales will hit a new record of just below $241 billion. The so-called Cyber Week (i.e., Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday) is predicted to account for one-fifth of online holiday sales. However, according to Adams, do not expect these jobs to be filled by many of those terminated by their companies this year. “Many of those who found themselves laid off this year from high-wage, high-skill roles, will not likely fill seasonal positions,” he said. Last year, the National Retail Federation, citing U.S. Census Bureau data, reported that core retail sales during the holiday season advanced by 3.8 percent over 2022, to an all-time high of $964.4 billion.

Title: Kong Report Unveils AI Landscape CXOs Must Navigate For Innovation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2024/10/03/kong-report-unveils-ai-landscape-cxos-must-navigate-for-innovation/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T05:43:04Z
Full Content:
API Artificial intelligence has moved beyond the hype cycle to become a transformative force in the enterprise. According to Kong's API Impact Report 2024, 92% of developers and business leaders say AI is a priority for their organizations. This widespread adoption is set to unleash a wave of innovation and economic growth, with APIs playing a crucial role in enabling AI technologies. The report, which surveyed 747 IT professionals and business leaders, reveals that the symbiotic relationship between AI and APIs is poised to create a staggering $43 trillion in cumulative economic impact by 2030. This projection underscores the critical importance of APIs in the AI ecosystem and highlights why CXOs need to prioritize their API strategy alongside AI initiatives. Here are 10 key insights from the report that every executive should consider: The promise of AI is not just hype - it's already translating into real-world results. A whopping 83% of respondents report that their organization's AI investments have created opportunities for new products or services in the last year. This rapid return on investment is likely driving the prioritization of AI, with 92% of those surveyed saying AI is a priority relative to other initiatives. For CXOs, this data point serves as a clear mandate to accelerate AI adoption. Organizations that lag behind in leveraging AI risk falling behind competitors who are already reaping the benefits of increased innovation and new revenue streams. ChatGPT remains the most widely used large language model in the workplace, with 27% of respondents reporting its use. However, the AI landscape is highly competitive and fragmented. Microsoft's Azure AI (18%) and Google Gemini (17%) follow closely, while a diverse range of other players like Meta's Llama, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic's Claude and others each capture significant market share. This diversity suggests organizations are exploring multiple AI solutions rather than relying on a single provider. LLM Adoption The above chart highlights a trend towards organizations adopting a multi-LLM strategy. As different models prove better suited for specific tasks, companies are increasingly leveraging various LLMs for different use cases. This approach allows organizations to benefit from the strengths of multiple AI models and services, potentially leading to more robust and versatile AI implementations across their operations. The competitive and rapidly evolving nature of the AI field is driving this strategic diversification in enterprise AI adoption. The report highlights that there's no AI without APIs. APIs serve as the eyes, ears and hands of AI systems, enabling communication between humans, AI systems and other digital tools. This interdependence is reflected in Gartner's prediction that by 2026, over 30% of the increase in demand for APIs will come from AI and tools using large language models. As AI usage proliferates, so will the number of APIs that enable them. CXOs should recognize that their API strategy is inseparable from their AI strategy. Investing in robust API management will be crucial for organizations looking to harness the full potential of AI technologies. With the exponential growth in API usage comes a corresponding increase in security risks. The report forecasts a 548% growth in the number of annual API attacks by 2030, reaching nearly 42,000 attacks in the U.S. alone. This alarming projection highlights the need for CXOs to prioritize API security as part of their overall cybersecurity strategy. As organizations rush to adopt AI, they must ensure that their API infrastructure is robust enough to withstand increasingly sophisticated attacks. Data privacy, security and regulatory compliance are the top reasons organizations implement AI restrictions, according to 60% of respondents. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable, as 60% of users admit to finding ways around their organization's AI usage restrictions. This disconnect between policy and practice presents a significant challenge for CXOs. It's crucial to develop AI governance frameworks that balance security and compliance requirements with the need for innovation and productivity. When it comes to integrating AI services with existing microservice infrastructures, data privacy and security/governance top the list of challenges for nearly 60% of those surveyed. This highlights the complexity of implementing AI at scale within enterprise environments. CXOs should be prepared to invest in tools and platforms that can help bridge the gap between AI services and existing infrastructure while maintaining robust security and governance controls. The impact of AI on the workforce is a mixed picture. While 57% of respondents say AI will make their job easier and 60% are passionate about working with AI, there are also concerns. About 35% feel AI adoption is moving too fast and 18% believe AI adoption will lead to layoffs in their organization. CXOs need to navigate these conflicting sentiments carefully. Implementing AI successfully will require not just technological investments, but also a focus on change management and upskilling initiatives to ensure employees are prepared for an AI-augmented workplace. Despite concerns about job displacement, the report suggests that AI is also creating new opportunities. Half of those surveyed say AI will enhance productivity and innovation, while 26% believe AI will create new positions or opportunities in their organizations. This finding aligns with historical patterns of technological disruption, where new technologies often create more jobs than they displace. CXOs should be prepared to identify and develop new roles that leverage AI capabilities to drive business value. Looking ahead, 3 out of 4 respondents believe AI will increase innovation and create new opportunities. This optimistic outlook suggests that AI is set to become a fundamental part of how work gets done across industries. As AI continues to reshape the business landscape, the symbiotic relationship between AI and APIs will play a crucial role in driving innovation and economic growth. CXOs who recognize this interdependence and invest accordingly will be well-positioned to lead their organizations into the AI-powered future. For CXOs, the message is clear: adopting AI is about positioning your organization for long-term success in a rapidly changing digital landscape. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Leaked: Whole Foods CEO tells staff he wants to turn Amazon’s RTO mandate into more ‘carrot’ than ‘stick’
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/02/leaked-whole-foods-ceo-meeting-amazon-5-day-rto-office-policy/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T21:43:24Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s five-day return-to-office order sent shock waves throughout the company and the broader business world last month. On Tuesday, Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel stepped up to the mic to assuage employee concerns at the Amazon-owned grocery chain. Saying he wanted Whole Foods employees to feel incentivized rather than bludgeoned into coming to the office every day, Buechel touted initiatives such as an “office experience task force” during a special meeting to address the RTO policy. “I want us to figure out, how do we find the win-win overall in supporting Whole Foods Market, our team members, our customers, and beyond,” Buechel said in the all-hands meeting on Tuesday, a recording of which was reviewed by Fortune. “Our goal here is not to make this seem like this is a stick,” he added. “We want to help create and work with our team members [in] having the carrot and getting the excitement about bringing back the culture and ultimately the interactions that we once had in our offices across the company.” Buechel said that his leadership team fielded 1,200 questions in advance of the meeting, which lasted a little less than an hour. Three employees attending the meeting in person were also given the mic to ask questions. The town hall comes two weeks after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that his company, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, would return to a full five days in office on Jan. 2, 2025, after nearly five years of remote and hybrid work at Amazon and its subsidiaries. Whole Foods spokesperson Rachel Malish only confirmed that Whole Foods staff will abide by the new Amazon mandate but did not respond to Fortune’s questions about the staff meeting. Jassy’s announcement came across as a tacit acknowledgement of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently chronicled. Jassy also noted that Amazon would look to thin out middle management and the bureaucracy that the CEO believes comes from too much of it, by reducing the ratio of middle managers to individual employees by 15%. One Whole Foods employee on Tuesday questioned leadership about how such a cut would be carried out at the organic grocery store chain. But Whole Foods HR exec Brian O’Connell told employees that that number is just a “target” and that the grocer has already “done a lot of good work” in reducing this ratio over the past year. “I don’t imagine we’re going to make a 15% reduction,” he said. Among the other queries employees had for management were questions about why Whole Foods workers should have to follow Amazon’s mandate when their compensation doesn’t always match that of their parent company counterparts, to whether the move was intended to force staff out, to how leadership plans to deal with a potential brain drain. Leadership offered vague answers to many questions—“freedom within a framework of a norm of an office-based culture” was one phrase from a Whole Foods marketing exec that especially rankled employees—and failed to explain how five days in office would fix problems that three days in person couldn’t. But Buechel was adamant that the mandate was not meant as an alternative to layoffs and that there would be flexibility to work from home when requiring quiet time to hit a deadline or if an unexpected personal need requires it. Buechel and other company executives pointed to efforts such as the creation of a new “office experience task force” made up of employees across company divisions who would be charged with brainstorming ideas to help staff transition from their current three-day hybrid structure to a new “office-based culture.” “What are things that we can do to make it exciting to come here and experience and work with our team members day in, day out?” the CEO asked rhetorically. The responsibility of figuring out how this balancing act will work will fall to individual managers, Buechel said. As for the company tracking how often employees badge into the office, which Jassy said would continue during the transition to full in-office work, the Whole Foods CEO said it would continue for now, but “my goal is to get rid of this” if employees “work responsibly.” “I don’t want us to be in this space,” he said. “I don’t want this to seem like we are punching a clock from 8 to 5.

Title: 5 Leadership Skills Every Leader And Manager Needs In 2025

Time Published: 2024-10-02T16:00:53Z
Full Content:
As we wind down 2024 and look ahead to 2025, it's important to reflect on the trends and shifts that ... [+] have occurred in the workforce this year so we as leaders can equip ourselves with the necessary skills to drive our organizations forward What a year 2024 has been. This year has been the year of actioned AI (artificial intelligence) implementation and integration; shocking announcements of employers forcing their teams to return to the office on a full-time basis; more layoffs from Big Tech and major consulting and financial firms and companies; hybrid work models gaining traction amid the flexible and remote work debate; and an increased number of organizations investing heavily in their upskilling programs, leading to reduced barriers for employees seeking to develop their careers. In light of this, what leadership skills should you prioritize as a senior business leader (and even as a middle manager) in your career development as you prepare for what 2025 might have in store for your team, department, or overall organization? The first and one of the most essential leadership skills any senior leader or manager needs to develop for 2025 is emotional intelligence, also referred to as EQ. A recent scientific research study published in the Revista de Gestão Social e Ambiental journal concluded that emotional intelligence in leaders correlates to favorable organizational cultures, high job satisfaction levels, and strong employee engagement. According to the same study, emotional intelligence in leaders manifests itself through traits and competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, interpersonal skills, and relationship management skills. Notably, it would be virtually impossible to say that you have a high level of EQ without excelling in communication skills or being self-aware, both in and out of the workplace. It is fairly evident that with the workforce undergoing the various changes we have witnessed, such as AI, restructuring after layoffs, the increased use of freelancers to supplement the talent gap in the workforce, and hybrid working, leaders and managers will need to up their game when it comes to knowing how to manage change effectively. Leaders at all levels of an organization need to champion change and the relevant upskilling needed for those changes to be successfully implemented (more on upskilling later). They should also be proactive in guiding teams through transitions while creating an atmosphere of psychological safety. Career resilience is critical for leaders and especially for middle managers, whose roles are being ... [+] eliminated in a bid for flattened organizational structures While most people commonly think of resilience and adaptability as necessary for leaders from an organizational point of view, this article approaches resilience from an entirely different angle: a leader's own career growth. Just a few days ago, Business Insider released an article titled, "It's a Tough Time To Be A Manager In Tech," which highlighted the disturbing realities of leading in the tech industry, brought to light recently in the wake of companies such as Amazon and Meta flattening their organizational structures in a bid to streamline their processes and be more efficient. With organizations eliminating middle managers from the talent structure, this is the time more than ever for middle managers to develop resilience for their own careers' sake. While being a middle manager in a tech firm (especially in Big Tech) might be seen as a dream job, it's essential not to get cushy, comfortable, and too relaxed in your role. Remember that you are easily disposable at this point, and your job is at risk. Therefore, always have a plan B for your job and career, keep your options open, and consider other career paths to contribute with your skills, such as consulting, freelancing, or pursuing a middle management role in another industry or organization. In Statista's analysis of skills on the rise between 2023 and 2027, based on a survey of more than 800 global companies (representing over 11.3 million employees worldwide), technological literacy was listed as the third most essential skill, with 68% of employers considering this to be the case. If leaders wish to implement sweeping AI changes across their organization and encourage its ethical use, they must model this AI-positive behavior. Leading by example, in this case, means educating yourself as a senior leader or middle manager about AI, Generative AI, the terminology surrounding it, practical use cases for your organization and the industry/market you operate in, understanding the risks associated with it, and knowing how to use it ethically so you can partner with AI software developers, upskill your workforce internally, and hire the right people to enable this integration to happen. It would help if you also remained consistently aware of emerging technological trends so you can be in the know before things happen on a mass scale. This way, you can prepare for change before it affects your organization in a significant way. Last but not least, resourcefulness and creativity are another essential leadership skill you will need for 2025. This has become more critical than ever since the introduction of artificial intelligence, highlighting the need for human reasoning and judgment so that they can be used effectively to augment work rather than entirely replace it. "More than 70% of companies surveyed consider creative thinking and analytical thinking to be the skills most expected to rise in importance between 2023 and 2027," states Statista. "Indeed, cognitive skills are growing in importance most rapidly due to increasing complexities in the workplace." While AI excels in administrative tasks and routine work at the basic level and can be used to help generate ideas, it needs help solving real problems. You will need to use AI to boost your innate curiosity, out-of-the-box thinking, and innovation. Technological literacy is the third most essential skill between now and 2027, according to more ... [+] than two-thirds of companies globally When you focus on developing leadership skills such as EQ, change management, career resilience, tech and AI literacy, and creativity/resourcefulness, you'll be better equipped to handle whatever 2025 brings to your workforce and organization. You will emerge as a confident and successful leader—setting you and your organization ahead of competitors and enabling productivity and real value to stakeholders. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The New Power of New York List 2024
URL: https://variety.com/lists/new-power-new-york-list-2024/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T16:00:00Z

What is power? Is it the speed with which an A-lister returns your calls, the ease in nabbing a reservation at the hottest Manhattan restaurant or how many times you appear on Page Six? Maybe it’s something ineffable, but more impactful: the ability to define and shape culture. That’s what you see in the movers and shakers in the media business, like CNN’s Mark Thompson and ABC News’ Almin Karamehmedovic, who are spotlighted here. And it’s certainly evident in creative geniuses like Heidi Gardner, a breakout star on “SNL”; Cole Escola, who has lit up Broadway with the rococo comedy “Oh, Mary!”; and Clairo, an indie rock darling. In all, this collection of New Yorkers have at least one thing in common — they’re making the most of their respective moments. Each brings to the table a unique set of talents, and each is leaving an imprint on their respective medium. What starts in New York changes the world. The Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy “You Hurt My Feelings” and the Anne Hathaway thriller “Eileen” were among the recent successes for Likely Story, the production company Bregman and Azpiazu founded in 2006. Since then, they’ve become a presence at Sundance — with three of their movies premiering at the fest’s 2023 edition. One upcoming project is “Power Ballad,” directed by John Carney (“Once”) and starring Paul Rudd and Nick Jonas. Since its 2021 rebranding, CBS’ morning broadcast has been fueled by its hosts’ chemistry. And while co-hosts Gayle King and Tony Dokoupil have long been familiar to CBS viewers, it’s Burleson — a former football player and sports journalist, and a sometime rapper under the moniker New Balance — who’s been the current panel’s darling. As a key member of WME’s theater department, Buzzetti represents many of Broadway’s biggest entertainers. He started his career in 1996 at the Ambrosio-Mortimer agency before joining Gersh two years later. Since Buzzetti joined WME in 2010, everyone from Lin-Manuel Miranda to David Lindsay-Abaire to Quiara Alegría Hudes has turned to him for his dealmaking prowess. Other clients, which include the productions “Avenue Q,” “In the Heights,” “The Book of Mormon” and “Hamilton,” have won Tonys and gone beyond Broadway, too, landing Oscars and Emmys. If you don’t recognize the name, your kids do. That’s because Cenat conquered Twitch with comedy livestreams, gaming marathons and celebrity collabs that reach more than 13 million users. The social media impresario’s livestreams with the likes of Kevin Hart and Ice Spice — some lasting for 24 hours — are hugely popular with Gen Z and Gen Alpha viewers. Cenat also has ventured into more traditional sides of the entertainment industry, releasing music and appearing in “Good Burger 2.” After Trevor Noah’s tenure ended, it seemed unclear what “The Daily Show” would do to move forward. One solution was to play the hits: Popular former host Stewart has returned, one night per week, through the election. Another, though, was to rely on team spirit: The regular suite of hosts — Chieng, Klepper, Kosta and Lydic — have distinguished themselves with sharp perspectives and insights. One of the fastest-rising artists in indie music, Claire Cottrill — aka Clairo — became a face of bedroom pop with her 2019 album “Immunity,” which featured the standout songs “Bags” and “Sofia.” She then channeled ’70s folk on her sophomore effort, “Sling,” and soft rock and soul on 2024’s “Charm.” Over the years, Cottrill has moved between the city and more spacious enclaves in upstate New York and Massachusetts, but her sound still permeates the five boroughs’ indie-rock corners. Last month, she played a five-night residency at Webster Hall. Adjmi got the idea for “Stereophonic” while listening to Led Zeppelin’s “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” on a plane. A decade or so later, his recording studio-set drama became the most Tony-nominated play in Broadway history (winning five). The three-hour show follows a Fleetwood Mac-like band as the members labor over their second album. They fall in and out of love; feud and reconcile; indulge in drugs, booze and egotism; and, somehow, amid all the disharmony, create beautiful music. Lately, J. Crew has been setting trends, not chasing them. A couple years ago, for instance, downtown scenesters one might never have expected to wear a mall brand were abuzz over the company’s giant-fit chinos. Credit for the brand’s menswear line goes to creative director Babenzien, who brings an edgy, gritty sensibility made familiar by SoHo’s Noah, which he founded, and by Supreme, the global streetwear colossus. As the head of FilmNation, Basner navigated the treacherous world of indie-film financing to become one of the entertainment business’s most influential figures. He has survived one pandemic and two labor strikes, along with changing tastes, to produce some of the year’s most exciting movies. They include “Conclave,” a Vatican thriller that’s generating Oscar heat, and “Anora,” a comedy about a sex worker in Brighton Beach that nabbed the Palme d’Or. The “Summer House” cast members came onto the series already friends; now, they’re building an empire. Berner, whose stand-up special “We Ride at Dawn” recently premiered on Netflix, and DeSorbo, host the podcast “Giggly Squad,” which launched in 2020. They also announced their forthcoming book of relationship advice, “How to Giggle: A Guide to Taking Life Less Seriously,” and are on an extensive national tour, sharing their loopy perspectives on life and love with their many devoted fans. In April, Amazon hired Bhatia, previously a senior executive at NBCUniversal, as vice president of global video advertising. It was a sign of the company’s wish to make more inroads on Madison Avenue by tapping someone steeped in traditional television advertising. All eyes are on Bhatia, who is well versed in the kinds of newer audience data that can help brands target the consumers they need to reach; the question is, can he bring the techniques he developed in more traditional media to Amazon? It shouldn’t have worked. Yet “The Outsiders,” a rough-and-tumble musical adaptation of S.E. Hinton’s gritty coming-of-age novel and Francis Ford Coppola’s film, has become a Broadway smash. Grant, playing Pony Boy, provides the story’s bruised spirit as a greaser from the wrong side of the tracks, and Taymor, the show’s director, staged a rain-soaked rumble that was so dazzling it helped “The Outsiders” capture the Tony for best musical. Houser lives in Brooklyn, but as co-founder and president of Rockstar Games and executive producer of the “Grand Theft Auto” series, he’s associated with the fictional city of Los Santos, the Los Angeles-inspired backdrop of “Grand Theft Auto V.” It’s the second-bestselling video game of all time, behind “Minecraft.” Rockstar also makes the blockbuster game series “Red Dead Redemption,” but all eyes are on the long-awaited “Grand Theft Auto VI,” due in 2025. Jacobs-Jenkins is the playwright behind last season’s hit “Appropriate,” a darkly comedic family drama starring Sarah Paulson, Corey Stoll and Elle Fanning. It was nominated for eight Tonys and won three, including best revival. He’s returning to Broadway with “Purpose,” another epic family drama. Described as a “moralistic satire,” the show follows an influential family that’s become a pillar of Black American politics. In the hands of Jacobs-Jenkins, “Purpose” is poised to be another can’t-miss Broadway event. Few filmmakers of any genre have as fertile a creative mind as Gibney. He’s helmed documentaries about Boris Becker, Paul Simon and “The Sopranos.” Gibney, while often focused on the famous, has also investigated secretive and challenging organizations like WikiLeaks and the Church of Scientology. His Jigsaw Productions, backed by Imagine Entertainment, promises to only grow more prolific. A five-time Grammy winner, Glasper is one of the leading forces bridging jazz with hip-hop. He played on Kendrick Lamar’s landmark album “To Pimp a Butterfly,” and has worked with artists like Common, Anderson .Paak and Q-Tip. With his sixth annual residency, Glasper is set to take over New York’s fabled Blue Note jazz club for the month of October, once again delivering the most exciting shows in Greenwich Village. Since joining “Saturday Night Live” in 2017, Gardner has emerged as a genuine breakout; her unscripted laughing in a 2024 “Beavis and Butt-Head” sketch went viral in part because Gardner’s characters tend to have a certain frustrated dignity. Gardner lives in New York but often reps her hometown of Kansas City on the show — notably when Travis Kelce hosted last year. Germanotta is best known professionally for co-founding the anti-bullying nonprofit Born This Way Foundation. Personally, she’s best known for her connection to the organization’s other founder — her daughter Stefani Germanotta, aka Lady Gaga. Gaga’s mother co-owns the well-loved Upper West Side restaurant Joanne Trattoria and advocates on behalf of young people’s mental health. The “13 Reasons Why” breakout recently stripped down to his skivvies as the, er, face of Calvin Klein. When he’s not burning up red carpets or anchoring photo shoots in glossy fashion magazines, Flynn has a burgeoning acting career, one that saw him rocking an old-timey mustache in the Lincoln assassination drama “Manhunt.” Next, he’ll try to scare audiences’ pants off appearing opposite Brian Cox and Edie Falco in the poltergeist thriller “The Parenting.” Starting off as Martin Scorsese’s assistant, Frechette has spent her career on film sets from “Shutter Island” to “The Wolf of Wall Street.” More recently, she stepped into a producing role for Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions, landing credits on his “Personality Crisis: One Night Only” and “Stories of a Generation — With Pope Francis.” In 2023, Frechette was an executive producer on the three-and-a-half-hour epic “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which went on to earn 10 Oscar nominations. Formerly a top executive at companies both sprawling and established (AOL Time Warner) and lean and scrappy (RadicalMedia), Friedman struck out on his own with Bungalow Media + Entertainment. The company takes a boutique approach to the TV shows, movies and digital media it gets involved with — and being selective pays. Recently, Bungalow launched several projects, including CBS’ “13 Days in Ferguson,” a look at the aftermath of Michael Brown’s killing, and Max’s “Serving the Hamptons,” a reality show set in a Southampton eatery. It’s been a bumpy year for Cohen, the real estate scion and film lover whose company defaulted on a loan that left his art-house cinema chains on the auction block. But Cohen Media Group, the indie label that Cohen controls, had some wins. “Io Capitano,” a searing drama about immigration, was nominated for an Oscar for best international feature, and the company released “Merchant Ivory,” a documentary about the cinematic duo, to raves. As YouTube’s head of TV, film and sports partnerships, Conkling oversees multibillion-dollar deals with broadcast and cable networks and sports leagues. She was instrumental in YouTube TV’s new pact with NFL Sunday Ticket, making the company the exclusive home of every football game in the U.S. In doing so, YouTube TV wrestled the must-see NFL bonanza — a favorite among super fans and sports bettors — away from DirecTV after 28 years. A nice Jewish boy walks into a white-nationalist meeting. What sounds like the setup to a dicey joke is the premise of “Just for Us,” Edelman’s very funny solo show about the time he attended a local Nazi rally after receiving antisemitic threats online. After a stint on Broadway, a taped version of the performance aired on HBO and won an Emmy. Escola has endeared themselves to audiences through YouTube videos as well as roles on television shows like “Difficult People.” But the 37-year-old is having their highest-profile moment yet as the writer and star of the Broadway phenom “Oh, Mary!” After a twice-extended downtown run, the play — which imagines Mary Todd Lincoln as an alcoholic aspiring cabaret singer terrorizing her husband while he tries to win the Civil War — is the hottest ticket in town. London-born and Oxford-educated, Thompson’s no stranger to New York: Among the postings in his long career are a role as the CEO of The New York Times Co., where he helped transform and modernize the paper’s presence online. At CNN, where he began in October 2023, Thompson stepped into a chaotic situation after the firing of Chris Licht; this summer, he announced plans to overhaul the newsroom, including layoffs. Comedy fans have long been familiar with Torres’ sensibility from “Saturday Night Live,” where he worked as a writer from 2016 to 2019, or from his show “Los Espookys”; his signature is a sort of loopy surreality, with tinges of camp and wordplay. This year, he created the HBO series “Fantasmas” and the A24 movie “Problemista,” both of which draw their humor from Torres’ experiences as a Salvadoran immigrant navigating life in New York. The Hollywood power player who co-founded the management company Untitled Entertainment also produces films and shows like “The Kill Room” and “Ray Donovan.” All the while, Weinberg, who transitioned decades ago from publicist to talent manager, has been keeping clients like Demi Moore (“The Substance”), Maya Hawke (“Inside Out 2”), Zoë Kravitz (“Blink Twice,” “The Batman”) and Jean Smart (“Hacks”) booked and busy. When the team behind the Tony-winning “Merrily We Roll Along” wanted to share the onstage magic with a wider audience, they turned to RadicalMedia; the company filmed performances of “Hamilton” to produce a beloved movie, and it will now do the same for “Merrily.” Thirty years after Radical was founded, Kamen and Scherma have kept growing the company. In addition to producing programs such as a History Channel JFK docuseries, Radical oversees marketing campaigns for companies ranging from Apple to Adidas. Taking the reins as the new president of ABC News, Karamehme dovic oversees the network’s many TV news titles, including “World News Tonight With David Muir,” “Good Morning America,” “The View,” “20/20” and “Nightline.” By the time he moved to New York in 2008, the 16-time Emmy winner had garnered a reputation as an intrepid field reporter, embedding himself with the U.S. Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and traveling to the country to document the fight against ISIS. The Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures chief serves as a bridge between Hollywood and Broadway, finding classic films that can inspire hit shows and vice versa. As a driving force behind “Beetlejuice: The Musical,” Kaufman proved there was life in the ghostly franchise, which gave the studio confidence when it came time to make a sequel to the original film. He also helped turn “The Outsiders,” a musical adaptation of a 40-year-old movie, into a zeitgeist-y stage smash. As Kevin Durant’s longtime manager as well as co-founder and CEO of Boardroom, Kleiman serves as an ambassador between the NBA and Hollywood. Boardroom produces daily newsletters as well as film and TV projects like “Swagger,” an Apple TV+ drama loosely inspired by Durant’s early life; and “NYC Point Gods,” a Showtime docuseries that examines how a group of ’80s and ’90s basketball legends reinvented the game. The madness of the 2024 election cycle has been a boon for cable news, including the women whose insights and intellects fuel MSNBC. Liberal viewers have likely needed reassurance or clarity at various points along the bumpy journey that brought us presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and the cabler’s veterans have an authority built over years of covering the turbulent political scene. Moon’s rise is straight out of a storybook. After graduating from high school in 2020, the 22-year-old was cast as a stand-in for Alicia Keys in “Hell’s Kitchen,” a jukebox musical inspired by the “Empire State of Mind” singer’s upbringing in Manhattan. Critics raved about her soaring voice and commanding stage presence. Then Moon won the Tony for best actress in a musical, becoming one of the youngest recipients of the award. Before becoming the executive producer of Sherri Shepherd’s talk show, Murray was a journalist and on-air personality, including on the nationally syndicated “Tom Joyner Morning Show.” Now, in addition to his producing duties on “Sherri,” which replaced “The Wendy Williams Show,” he’s bringing a shot of pop-culture energy as an on-camera commentator. As the ambitious and tightly wound trader Harper Stern on HBO’s financial drama “Industry,” Myha’la has provided the show its sense of intense competition. In its third season, the series has become a lifeline for those who miss the gamesmanship of “Succession,” and Myha’la has leveled up; she also appeared in the 2022 feature “Bodies Bodies Bodies” and the 2023 Netflix sensation “Leave the World Behind.” A lot is riding on James Gunn’s DC cinematic universe reboot, particularly after the last one imploded in spectacular fashion (cause of death: “Justice League”). And to get it right, the DC Studios chief enlisted Ana Nogueira, an actress turned scribe, to write “Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.” The film, which Gunn describes as a “science fiction epic,” will debut in 2026 and pick up where his next movie, “Superman,” leaves off. After that, Nogueira will write a “Teen Titans” film. As CEO of Jay-Z’s multimillion-dollar entertainment powerhouse Roc Nation, Perez oversees the careers of titans like Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Megan Thee Stallion and Fat Joe. As head of the company in charge of programming the Super Bowl halftime show — for which it has won five Emmys — Perez placed clients, including Shakira and Rihanna, on the world’s biggest stage. She’s also helped Roc Nation lean into its charitable efforts, and was credited by Lil Uzi Vert for encouraging the rapper to seek treatment for a Xanax addiction. The ABC News correspondent is recognizable to TV viewers from his appearances on “Good Morning America.” But this year, Reeve shares a more personal side with the release of “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story.” The film draws on home movies that prominently feature Reeve and his half-siblings, Alexandra Reeve and Matthew Reeve, interacting with their famous dad both before and after the horse-riding accident that left him paralyzed, inspiring him to become an advocate for people with disabilities. Bring tissues. The liberal voice on Fox News can be an uncomfortable position to occupy. But you’ve got to hand it to Tarlov, a Democratic Party political strategist and rotating co-host of the panel show “The Five”: She can take care of herself. Tarlov is plainspoken and direct in defending Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. As the conservative-leaning panel’s dissenting voice, she’s the one saying things the network’s core audience doesn’t want to hear. “The View” is one of the Teflon brands on daytime — for all the reinventions and cast changes, the core idea and the rock-solid fandom remains the same. As executive producer, Teta is entrusted with making sure the show stays true to its identity, including continuing to generate watercooler moments and booking splashy interviews with newsmakers. Thomas parlayed his career as a child actor on shows like “Victorious” and “iCarly” into making music with some of the industry’s biggest names — including one of his former co-stars, Ariana Grande. The Brooklyn-born artist scored writing credits on the pop star’s “Yours Truly” and “Positions” albums, plus production work with Drake, Post Malone and Jack Harlow — and also makes his own music. In 2024, he won a Grammy as a songwriter on SZA’s “Snooze.” A manager, sales agent and lawyer, Sloss is a different kind of multi-hyphenate. He doesn’t write movies, or act in and direct them, but he brings different creative forces together. The Cinetic Media founder is a sounding board for indie mavericks like Richard Linklater and Todd Haynes, as well as a dealmaker, helping sell and promote their movies. New York is still the center of indie film, and Sloss, who lives and works here, is part of its beating heart. Playing George Russell, a rapacious robber baron with a secret soft side, on HBO’s “The Gilded Age” turned Spector into the period drama’s unlikely heartthrob. The second season ended with a rare moment of marital discord between George and his wife, Bertha, who are usually in lockstep in their quest to conquer New York society. When the new season debuts in 2025, viewers will learn if the Russell marriage survives or if George becomes TV’s most eligible bachelor. Formerly the host of CNN’s media-criticism show “Reliable Sources,” Stelter was laid off by the network in 2022 due to cost-cutting. Now, after two years, during which time he wrote the Fox News takedown “Network of Lies,” Stelter returns to write for and appear on CNN. Stelter’s varied career includes an executive producer credit on “The Morning Show,” but he’s best known lately for sounding the alarm on air about the dangers of disinformation. Stern is managing director of Playground, the company that’s worked on some of Broadway’s buzziest plays and musicals, like “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” “Dear Evan Hansen,” “New York, New York” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” He’s also worked extensively as a producer on projects such as Kenneth Lonergan’s “Howards End” for BBC, the Kelsey Grammer-led “The Last Tycoon” and “Rosemary’s Baby” with Zoe Saldaña. Three decades after it was launched to help revive lower Manhattan in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Tribeca Festival continues to celebrate the city and its connection to cinema. Rosenthal, who co-founded the event with Robert De Niro, has kept Tribeca relevant by expanding its influence beyond film and into virtual reality and gaming. When freed from festival duties, Rosenthal is an in-demand producer, with credits that include “Wag the Dog” and “The Irishman.” Schoenbrun is emerging as one of their generation’s most innovative and surreal filmmakers, with this year’s “I Saw the TV Glow” breaking out at Sundance and hitting theaters nationwide. “I Saw the TV Glow” is a Lynchian allegory about isolated teenagers seeking connection through a shared favorite show; Schoenbrun, who is trans and nonbinary, drew from their own experiences, including their youthful interest in fantasy TV. As head of AMC Networks Film Group, Shooman runs both IFC Films, a distributor of art-house films, and Shudder, a streaming service that traffics in horror and slasher movies. That unique vantage point has inspired Shooman to back offbeat films, such as the occult thriller “Late Night With the Devil,” that have become some of the company’s biggest theatrical successes at a time when the box office has been contracting.

Title: National pharmacy chain to lay off nearly 3,000 workers

WOONSOCKET, Rhode Island — CVS Health announced Tuesday it plans to lay off 2,900 employees, a move that comes about a year after the pharmacy chain laid off 5,000 workers. Mike DeAngelis, executive director of corporate communications, tells USA Today that the latest round of layoffs will be “primarily corporate roles.” Quartz reports the layoffs are part of the company’s effort to reduce $2 billion in costs. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” DeAngelis tells CNN. The most recent layoffs represent less than 1% of the company’s overall workforce, CNN reports.

An analyst tells CNN that drug store chains in the U.S. are struggling “because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs.” Competition from Amazon and chains such as Target, Walmart, Costco and dollar stores has cut into drug stores’ non-pharmaceutical sales, CNN reports. CVS reportedly has nearly 350 locations in Ohio, including dozens in Northeast Ohio. It has nearly 9,200 locations in the U.S. CVS has closed about 900 stores since 2022, CNN reports.

Title: Amazon’s RTO charge is just layoffs in disguise, experts say
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/02/amazon-rto-layoffs-in-disguise-andy-jassy/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T09:00:00Z

Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced last month, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, already has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them is that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Man Baffled When He Shows Up for Job Interview and the Interviewer Is an AI Avatar

Time Published: 2024-10-01T21:53:14Z

When being evaluated for a job, employment seeker and marketer Jack Ryan found himself being interviewed by an artificial intelligence-powered avatar — and was not exactly thrilled with the experience. Ryan told 404 Media that the avatar he interviewed with, which was developed by a Melbourne-based AI startup called Fairgo, was "a perfect demonstration of late-stage capitalism." "While Fairgo's intent is to provide a fair and equitable interview process," Ryan said, "I can't imagine AI, [large language models], and other tools are able to interpret the human emotion and facial reactions to provide an actual, well-rounded interview." In a clip posted to his LinkedIn last week, the Silicon Valley-based marketer and self-described disabled athlete was seen smirking as the red-haired female avatar asked him for his work experience and encouraged him to get creative. "I find it helps when candidates tell me a story in answering the questions," the avatar, which does not appear to have a name, said robotically. It's a perfect encapsulation of the kind of uncanniness many said the age of AI would usher in — except, of course, far more banal. On its website, the startup claims that candidates interviewed by Fairgo avatars "consistently love the interview experience" — but Ryan very much disagrees. "As a disabled individual who is reliant on remote work, I am already concerned about openly stating I am disabled in the forms that companies put at the end of their job applications," he explained to 404. "To add an AI component into this mix, I imagine, would have the opposite effect of [diversity, equity, and inclusion]." Fairgo's CEO Julian Bright insisted in his own interview with 404 that his company's AI is actually there to help reduce human bias. Furthermore, Bright maintained that Fairgo's AI is not at all involved in the candidate selection process and that it does not use any video or audio taken during the process to evaluate candidates. All the same, being interviewed by an AI avatar seems to have left a bad taste in Ryan's mouth. "As someone who has interviewed upwards of 50 candidates for prior roles, human connection and interaction is the single most important indicator of how a team will mesh and jive together," he said. "If an AI is running the early stage process, it eliminates potential candidates because of its algorithmic design." At the end of the day, using a service like Fairgo's "shows how executives and corporations are further trying to cut costs on the human side of business," Ryan said. "As someone who has seen these layoffs at numerous top tech companies that then go on to rehire 6-12-18 months later... it's laughable at best and terrifying at worst," he concluded. We can't say we didn't smirk along with Ryan — but that's only to keep ourselves from crying.

Title: More Than 75,000 American Workers On Strike Today

This is a published version of Forbes’ Careers Newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Dockworkers strike at the entrance to a container terminal at the Port of Baltimore, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) Americans are on strike. Nearly 100,000 workers across the United States are walking off the job over contract negotiations with their employers, ranging from dockworkers to Boeing employees. The latest to join the picket line as of midnight on Tuesday are 45,0000 dockworkers from Maine to Texas. The union representing East and Gulf Coast dockworkers failed to reach a deal with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance. Specifically, the union wants stricter protections for its workers who they say are vulnerable to being replaced by automation and demanding a 77% wage increase over the next six years. And that doesn’t include 33,000 Boeing workers, primarily in its manufacturing sector, who are still on strike after they rejected the company’s “best and final offer” for a contract. The company has since implemented a hiring freeze, paused taking on new plane and part orders (with some exceptions) and furloughing white collar and desk-based employees. The two labor actions stem from similar complaints: wage increases, and protections for workers who could be replaced by automation or AI. Indeed, such talent (and retention) concerns are among the top concerns for manufacturers. About 50% of the top challenges faced by manufacturing companies are talent- and people-related, according to a survey by ABI research. But it’s not just an issue in the manufacturing industry. Last year, unions representing screenwriters and actors (SAG and WGA) also held strikes that paused Hollywood production over AI protections for artists.

Find ways to “upskill” without going to school. Shot of a group of businesspeople having a meeting in a modern office A new report by Owl Labs shows that American employees are increasingly prioritizing “green-flag” bosses in their careers. Some, more so than healthcare benefits. Have you ever quit a job because of a bad boss? What about staying at a bad job because of a good boss? Managers have so much to do with our experience at work. From providing support in your current role to creating paths for career development, they are your main point of contact with company leadership. So employees (and job seekers) are taking a closer look at who their manager is, and how the boss can help be advocates for them. “A lot of it has to do with putting trust into someone else for their career,” says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs, “especially as a hybrid or remote worker.” Indeed, the potential for things to go south with a bad manager can be so daunting that Americans are prioritizing a good boss with “green flags”—things like support, advocacy and helpful feedback. According to Owl Labs, 92% of employees said that a supportive manager is the most important factor to their work, second only to compensation. This is up from last year, when 85% of surveyed employees said it was important to their work, behind compensation as well. “Generations now are really thinking about interviewing their boss [during the job process],” adds Weishaupt, “because if they’re going to be represented by this person within the company, they want to make sure they trust them.” News from the world of work Dell joined tech giant Amazon in ordering employees back to the office full-time on Thursday, though the order only applies to salespeople for now, according to Bloomberg.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Smite Developer Hi-Rez Lays Off Employees, Focusing on Smite 2

Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:16:23Z

Hi-Rez has announced that they have made layoffs within the company as part of an "internal reorganization and prioritization." Smite 2 is already in Early Access but requires those who are interested in playing it to purchase the Founder's Pack first before the game goes free-to-play after the first year. Studio Head Steward Chisam made a lengthy post on X, saying that the changes that Hi-Rez have made are "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was first released in 2014, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has been ported to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and even Amazon Luna. The only place players can't play the game is on mobile. Smite has been a hugely successful game in the MOBA genre, with there being many characters to choose from and a big esports scene with multiple tournaments, which also includes the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship. Chisam hasn't disclosed how many were laid off in the restructuring and said that "this will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&A, and Titan Forge divisions." It's said that there will still be some developers working in small teams on Paladins and Smite to provide light updates to the games, but most of the studio is now shifting its focus entirely over to Smite 2. In the post, it's said that the team is now pivoting their focus on "gameplay development in the near term," which will include new modes, Gods, and quality-of-life improvements for the title rather than focusing on cosmetic and monetization features, which was originally the game plan for the Smite 2 team. Chisam has said that this has "a real human impact at a tough time," but also states that Smite 2's development team overall is larger than Smite's "throughout most of its life cycle. The team working on Gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the Smite 1 team ever was for such features. In this lengthy statement, it's also mentioned that they want to make Smite 2 the best possible game experience that can sustain itself "long into the 2030s." As the game is still in the Alpha stage, it's said that they have learned a lot about the process of "migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets players expectations and moves faster." Whether the amount of layoffs will be disclosed in the future is uncertain, and replies to the post have been turned off.

Title: How the Mouse Stumbled

By Ej Dickson A few years ago, I was talking to the host of a popular Disney-theme-park podcast when the conversation invariably led to where it always does between two Disney adults: Why do we love Disney so much, when everything it does seems tailor-made to piss us off? This was in 2022, in the midst of a particularly brutal public-relations war sparked by the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ legislation prohibiting public schools from including materials about LGBTQ+ identities in their curricula. Many Disney employees were outraged by the bill, and because the company’s largest theme park is based in the state, there was massive internal pressure on then-CEO Bob Chapek to speak out against it. But Chapek did the opposite, explaining in a memo that publicly decrying Don’t Say Gay would “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and would only serve to “further divide and inflame.” Eventually, following days of bad press, Chapek issued a memo apologizing for not publicly opposing the bill. But the damage had already been done: Both progressives and conservatives were outraged, and the bad press eventually led to his ouster a few months later. According to reporting from The New York Times, Chapek would later tell people that he felt unfairly targeted, since his handling of the bill (or more accurately, its lack thereof) had been supported by the board as he went. Disney’s approach struck many, including myself, as the apogee of corporate bungling. It felt like the company was sending a clear message that although it would be happy to accept money from members of the LGBTQ+ community, that wasn’t tantamount to acknowledging its right to exist. And as a queer Disney fan myself, that message didn’t sit well with me. So I asked this podcast host: How did he square his own principles with loving Disney? Did he feel bad about it? He didn’t have to think twice about his answer. “Not really,” he said. “They keep putting out stuff I like. Yes, it’s a big, soulless corporation. And, yes, I still love it. Because they make things that move me.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 At the time, I thought this was kind of bullshit. There are a lot of brands that make things that move people. I, for one, am moved by fried-chicken sandwiches and carbonated water and $10 canvas sneakers. Yet I avoid buying Chick-fil-A or a SodaStream or Shein clothes, because there are aspects of their business practices that do not move me, that I, in fact, find repugnant. And while it may be momentarily satisfying to write a scathing Twitter thread calling out colonialist violence or evangelical Christian homophobia, voting with my wallet is by far my most effective form of protest. So why not do that, even if it means I can’t stream The Simpsons on Disney+, or purchase the new Pizza Planet-truck-inspired popcorn bucket? Is that really such a difficult tradeoff in order to affect some concrete, if marginal, change in the world? As it turns out, for me at least, the answer is yes. Because a few weeks — not even a few months — after the Don’t Say Gay debacle, I booked a trip to Disney World. I’ve gone on at least two more since then; in fact, I just came back from another one two weeks ago. I haven’t stopped buying my kids Disney-branded clothes and toys. I haven’t even canceled Disney+. The simple explanation for why I do this is because I am a hypocrite who is devoid of integrity. But I fear the actual explanation is far more complicated. I am one of a cadre of people who self-identify as Disney adults. While it would be easy to define this group as “adult Disney fans,” it’s a little bit like saying Beauty and the Beast is a movie about a hot girl who reads a lot and then develops Stockholm syndrome; it’s technically true, but it also kind of misses the point. Unlike Swifties or Trekkies or Philadelphia sports fans, Disney adults can’t really be defined by one or more demographic traits; you can’t say they skew white and female or middle-aged and nerdy or inebriated and prone to battery-throwing, because they are any and all of the above. They are united by only one factor: an unflagging belief that everything Disney puts out, from its streaming shows to its theme-park attractions to its cruises to its animated films, is superior to that of its competitors, in that it is infused with a specific ethos that can only be summarized as “Disney magic.” Disney magic is a term that’s even more difficult to define than Disney adult. On a customer-service level, it refers to the small touches that make a park guest’s stay more memorable: a free dessert here, an extra 30 seconds interacting with Chip and Dale there. It’s the type of attention to detail that is supposed to make you forget you’re spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, because Disney is not supposed to feel like a vacation at all. It’s supposed to feel like an enhanced version of reality, where the people are nicer, the streets are cleaner, and the food tastes (marginally) better. But there’s another aspect of Disney “magic” that’s more ineffable. It’s the way a full-grown adult man kind of has to catch his breath when he sees an actor playing Cinderella in full regalia. It’s the distinctly floral chlorine scent that wafts from the waters of Pirates of the Caribbean (so beloved that there are candles sold on Etsy inspired by the odor), or the way you automatically hear a clip-clop of hooves when “76 Trombones” pipes through the sound system of Main Street USA. It’s a feeling that marketing experts would likely chalk up to decades upon decades of a multinational conglomerate building brand allegiance across generations, but that a less cynical person would attribute to the apotheosis of the ideology popularized by Walt Disney himself, the idea that Disney will exist “as long as there is imagination left in the world.” Disney magic can be best summarized as a testament to the boundless human capacity for imagining, whether that applies to a child gazing up at Sleeping Beauty’s castle or an executive trying to figure out how to maximize quarterly Frozen-merch earnings. As a kid, I went to the Disney parks with my family probably every other year, because they were the one place where our conversations didn’t end in shouting and tears. I used to spend hours writing in my journal about vacations we took months ago, documenting every little detail like where we went to eat or about other families we’d met at the hotel. I would read and reread these entries, because they served as a reminder for me that there was a place where I could be happier than I was at home or at school, where all the kids thought I was a snaggle-toothed weirdo who read the dictionary for fun. (They were right, but that’s not germane.) So for me, Disney magic was the ability to envision a world where people were nicer than we were to one another, or than my family was to ourselves. Disney is, of course, not just its parks: It is an entire brand universe, comprising consumer products, publishing, media networks (ESPN, ABC, FX), studios (Pixar, LucasFilm, Marvel, 20th Century Studios), and international operations. It has such a stranglehold on the culture at large that according to one survey, Mickey Mouse has a higher level of name recognition than Santa Claus. Entire generations have grown up on a steady diet of Disney-owned properties, a list that has only expanded since the acquisitions of Marvel, LucasFilm, Pixar, and 20th Century Fox over the past two decades. One could theoretically spend an entire human life cycle exclusively consuming Disney products, from being swaddled in a Mickey-branded Huggies diaper to exchanging wedding vows in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. And while there’s no such thing as a Disney-branded birth or funeral, I would bet my 401(k) that the idea has been floated in boardrooms. For the past few years, however, there has been a distinct sense that Disney has been slipping in its ability to consistently provide consumers its trademark magic. Though 2023, the company’s centennial, was projected to be a banner year, its last animated feature, Wish, was a box-office flop, as was Pixar’s Elemental; its Marvel entries, The Marvels and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, fared little better. In May 2024, CEO Bob Iger revealed at an investor conference that Disney+, the company’s streaming service that launched in 2019, was operating at a $4 billion loss, largely due to what he deemed an emphasis on “volume and not quality,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Even the parks division, typically the most profitable of Disney’s verticals, is flailing, with operating profit declining three percent last quarter due to what CFO Hugh F. Johnston referred to as “moderation of consumer demand.” Share prices have plummeted. Over the past few months, I have spoken to various figures within Disney’s extensive orbit. Depending on who you speak to, the loss of Disney magic can be attributed to a wide range of factors: Many point to Bob Chapek, the parks head turned CEO who, by the end of his brief tenure, was so widely reviled that he was literally booed off the stage at the D23 fan expo. According to a September New York Times investigation, Chapek had essentially been pushed out by his predecessor Iger, who served as CEO for 16 years before retiring in 2021. A beloved figure within the company for years, Iger had become frustrated with Chapek’s poor management of Disney creatives, according to the Times piece, orchestrating his ouster even after he had personally hand-picked him as his successor. Others pointed to various external factors, such as the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the parks being temporarily shuttered, tens of thousands of employees being laid off, and a $4.7 billion loss in the third quarter of 2020. The economic instability brought about by the pandemic “was bad for every company, but especially Disney, because they count so much on the parks” for revenue, says Scott Gustin, a reporter who covers theme parks. “And I don’t think things have been steady [at the company] since.” Overall, however, there is a distinct sense among almost everyone I spoke with that over the course of the past few decades, via a series of decisions motivated by an amalgam of greed and complacency, Disney is in serious danger of losing its position as a cultural juggernaut. “Disney’s never hidden the fact they’re all about your money,” one former midlevel corporate employee told me. “But they’ve also provided high-value entertainment, high-value experiences. Now, I would say the company has pivoted to nickel-and-diming. And they are not providing high-quality entertainment and experiences in the same way.” (Disney did not respond to requests for interview or comment.) These conversations painted a portrait of a corporation on autopilot and operating under the assumption that it is simply too big to fail. These sources contend that while this may have been true for Disney at one point, the company has squandered enough goodwill among its consumers that it no longer is. “There is a sense that if the company is not careful and they don’t adjust their course, that there is a point where people won’t see them as the leader anymore,” says one former employee. They also were reflective of a company that is dismissive toward, if not outright contemptuous of, its most loyal fans. According to two former corporate employees, the company eschews hiring what one referred to as “superfans,” viewing a love for the brand as “a huge turnoff.” “To me, it feels counterintuitive, because I feel like you’d want to hire the people who know the brand best, so they can protect it,” the person said. “Some of your biggest advocates are going to be these people.” Fans of the parks in particular have expressed mounting frustration with rising ticket prices, the elimination of various amenities, and the perceived decrease in quality of the overall experience. Many of the sources I spoke to for this piece told me that in recent years, staffing had been an issue at the parks, leading to attractions being shut down, and overwhelmed employees providing poor customer service. Some issued complaints directly to the company, only for such feedback to fall on deaf ears. “They tolerate fans,” the former corporate employee told me. “They take their money. But I feel like the fans and the bloggers and the influencers kind of annoy them, too. From my perspective, they don’t market toward the people who are their biggest moneymakers.” In true Disney-adult form, many sources I spoke with skewed toward personifying these failures, viewing them as reflective not of a multibillion-dollar corporation subject to shifting markets and trends, but of an individual whose actions cause personal disappointment. One source I spoke with likened the company to a toxic ex-boyfriend who you always come back to against your better judgment; another person, to a high school mean girl. Now, they say, the brand is facing the consequences. “People are revolting against Disney,” one former executive said. “They are sick of the bully in the room.” TO BE FAIR, DISNEY HAS BEEN in similarly dire straits before. In the early 1980s, the company had lost its primacy in the film and animation markets, churning out forgettable features like The Fox and the Hound and Pete’s Dragon. Between 1982 and 1984, its net income fell by 25 percent, making itself vulnerable to takeover attempts by corporate raiders. With the appointment of Michael Eisner as CEO in 1984, Disney’s fortunes shifted, ushering in the so-called Golden Age of Disney animation with features like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin; drastically expanding the parks, including Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Paris; and acquiring ABC in 1995, including ESPN. Eisner also introduced the particularly brilliant marketing strategy of capitalizing on its existing intellectual property (IP) by selling limited-edition VHS tapes of classic Disney films, releasing them only for short periods of time. This strategy allowed millions of Gen X-ers and millennials to inject the iconography of Disneyana — the princesses, the castles, the songs, and, of course, the non-fucking mice — directly into their veins. In 2005, after a series of high-profile box-office flops and public feuds with former Disney animation exec Jeffrey Katzenberg, the board pressured Eisner to step down as CEO, leading him to hand the reins to then-President Bob Iger. As he documents in his book, The Ride of a Lifetime, Iger had inherited a company that was flailing as it had in 1984: The post-9/11 economic recession had sent Disney’s stock price tumbling, the animation department was adrift, and the advent of internet piracy had taken a bite of the company’s profits. “Almost every traditional media company, while trying to figure out its place in this changing world, was operating out of fear rather than courage,” Iger wrote, “stubbornly trying to build a bulwark to protect old models that couldn’t possibly survive the sea change underway.” In short, it was a climate very similar to that of our current media landscape, and Iger was able to clearly visualize a path forward for Disney that did not rely on traditional media frameworks. Foreseeing the impending demise of cable television, he became an early advocate for digital-first mobile-streaming content; he also led the acquisition of Pixar, which was by far outpacing Disney in terms of its creativity and ingenuity, thus successfully reinvigorating the animation team. Both of these decisions were widely derided and extremely expensive: “In essence,” Iger wrote of the launch of Disney+, the company’s streaming subscription service, “we were hastening the disruption of our own business, and the short-term losses were going to be significant.” But Iger was keenly aware of the fact that such short-term losses were essential to preserving the integrity of the brand and the quality of the product. “You have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there’s nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product,” he wrote. Under Iger’s leadership, Disney became a mega-conglomerate with massive global reach, with the company opening parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and building its extensive library of IP with the acquisition of Marvel, LucasFilm, and 20th Century Fox. And while this rapid growth has gone a long way in establishing the company’s dominance in the global market, it has also come with accompanying growing pains, particularly following the 20th Century Fox merger in 2019, according to a number of former corporate employees I spoke with. Once a legendary Golden Age film studio that produced such classic films as The Sound of Music, Star Wars, and Titanic, Disney’s acquisition essentially “swallowed up” the company and “spit out what it didn’t want,” according to one source. “That was a very dark point,” says the source. “It was ugly. It was ruthless.” The deal was accompanied by multiple rounds of layoffs, as well as a growing sense of complacency that made many employees’ lives difficult. One former employee sums up the attitude as follows: “You’re so lucky to work here, because you get to work on the best content, the best movies, the best shows in the world. If you are unhappy, we don’t need you.” To a degree, that attitude has always existed within the Disney brand. Yet those I spoke with said it was more justifiable prior to the merger, as well as the launch of Disney+ in 2019. That year, the company hit a high-water mark both creatively and commercially: Thanks to the release of box-office smashes like Frozen II, Toy Story 4, Avengers Endgame, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the company grossed a record $13 billion globally, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the worldwide box office. Something shifted, however. Multiple sources tell me that employees felt they were under so much pressure to ramp up output for the platform, and to establish it as a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon, that it became impossible to keep up. “There’s a pretty obvious decline in quality starting from 2019,” one former corporate executive tells me. “[2019’s] The Mandalorian is the only thing on Disney+ that was treated with the same care as they had treated [previous releases]. The pressure was just so intense to put out as much content as possible.” The end result has been a string of anemic superhero franchise entries (The Marvels), overhyped streaming series (the just-canceled The Acolyte), bloated franchise reboots (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), underperforming live-action remakes (Mulan, Pinocchio), and uninspired animated features, previously the bulwark of the Disney entertainment division (Onward, Strange World, Elemental). Though there have been a few hits over the past few years — 2021’s WandaVision was critically acclaimed, while Disney Animation Studios’ Encanto got a huge boost from its soundtrack going viral on social media — much of its output has been disappointing. And while some of these failures could be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with people failing to return to theaters in pre-2020 numbers, that explanation only goes so far. One source I spoke with speculated that the pandemic only served to highlight how little care Disney was giving to the quality of its entertainment offerings, operating on the assumption that people were bored at home and would watch anything put out under the Disney brand — an assumption that was proven wrong with the failure of what they viewed as subpar films like Soul and Luca. “Covid brought Disney to its knees,” one person told me. “And the problem is, Disney didn’t think it could be brought to its knees. So now it has to reckon with that.” On the parks side, previously Disney’s biggest revenue driver, the company has especially struggled. “There’s a lot of discourse around Disney’s rapid growth, and with that a lot of discourse about its perceived greed and the deep decline and quality of their movies and their parks,” says Jenny Nicholson, a YouTuber and former Disney cast member. In the spring of 2024, Nicholson posted a scathing four-hour video essay chronicling the downfall of one of the parks’ most notorious failures, Walt Disney World’s immersive Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which cost thousands of dollars a night and was open for barely 14 months before it shut down. Nicholson’s video essay condemning the project as an ill-conceived cash grab amassed more than 10 million views, seemingly due to its ability to tap into the mounting “frustrations” fans have with the parks, she says. These frustrations can be best summarized as the distinct feeling that guests are being cheated. Since the parks temporarily shut down in 2020, the company has slowly eliminated beloved amenities such as early park hours for resort guests, or free transportation from the airport to Disney hotels, or ways for fans to skip lines for free, all while steadily boosting ticket prices. “There seems to be a lot more push toward short-term profits as opposed to the overall longevity and reputation of the company,” says Nicholson. As a result of the skyrocketing prices, guests are increasingly shying away from the parks. On an August 2024 earnings call, CFO Hugh Johnston indicated that there had been a three percent decrease, or “a bit of a slowdown,” in operating income at the domestic parks during the third quarter. He added that the company anticipated a similar decline in earnings in future quarters, downplaying it as “a slight moderation in demand.” Such an admission must be particularly galling for the company in light of its arch rival, Universal Studios, building a massive theme park expansion called Epic Universe just a few miles away from Kissimmee, Florida, where Walt Disney World parks and resorts are located. One theme park journalist told me that over the past decade, Disney’s Imagineering division — the department focused on creating new theme-park rides and attractions — has focused too much on capitalizing on lucrative IP, such as the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, and less on creativity. “Where [consumers] sit, in 2024, we’re just after who’s innovating and who’s giving us thrills and spending money,” the journalist said. “And that’s Universal by far.” Disney’s overreliance on existing IP has been a source of frustration for fans for close to a decade — and if you look at the company’s slate of upcoming releases, it does not seem that they plan to pivot anytime soon. During the August 2024 call, Johnston noted that the downward trends in parks would likely be offset by the entertainment division, including the upcoming releases of highly anticipated films like the CGI-animated Lion King prequel Mufasa, and Moana 2. Citing those two examples is telling: Both are based on existing Disney IP, only emphasizing that the company has become overly reliant on adapting preexisting material, rather than generating new and fresh ideas. “Disney only has a few rabbits in their sleeve when it comes to bringing people to the movies,” one former employee told me. “There’s only so many animated films they can turn [into] live action. There’s only so many rides they can turn into films.” The quality, the former employee said, “is just not there anymore.” Ultimately, however, in speaking to various fans and insiders of all stripes, Disney’s decline can be boiled down to one crucial factor: arrogance. Having achieved market primacy for so long, and having garnered such a rabidly devoted and demographically wide-ranging fan base, there is an overwhelming sense that there is nothing Disney can possibly do to lose its hold over the public imagination. To adapt a famous 2016 election-era Trump boast, if Bob Iger stood in the middle of Main Street and shot Goofy in broad daylight, the company would probably lose some fans — but certainly not all. Its guiding ethos appears to be bolstered by the sense that it is simply too big to fail in any meaningful way. But if its recent string of failures are any indication, for one of the few times in the company’s history, it may not be right. ONCE, WHEN I WAS IN MY very early twenties, I was on a vacation with my family and we got into a fight. I can’t remember what it was about, but I was distraught enough that I needed to not be with them at the time. So I stalked off into the distance, sniffling and shaking and ignoring my phone calls, in search of someplace where I had always felt safe. And I ended up on the It’s a Small World ride. As my Friendship Boat gently rocked through the water, the intoxicating chlorine fragrance intermingling with that of the microwaved pizza from Pinocchio’s Village Haus next door, and animatronic kiwis and flying fish and can-can girls winking at me from the plasticine shores, it suddenly occurred to me how insane this all was. In a moment of emotional turmoil, I had not retreated into meditation or drugs or alcohol or cognitive behavioral therapy or any of the other tactics at my disposal. Instead, I’d beelined, as if by mammalian instinct, like a dying elephant making its way across the savannah, to a 1965 World’s Fair exhibition sponsored by Pepsi. Why had I done this? What was this going to offer me? How was this going to make me feel better? This wasn’t even an E-ticket attraction. There are about a million reasons I can think of to point out why It’s a Small World should not be emotionally effective. It’s long. It’s boring. It is built around a conception of global unity that does not celebrate cultural and political differences but completely eradicates them, as represented in the ride’s final tableau showing all the children of the world clad in the same generic white outfits, singing and holding hands, looking like a Benetton ad as conceived by the Hare Krishnas. Its primary designer, Mary Blair, was a genius whose artistic gifts were sublimated by the misogyny of the Disney company, resulting in a life of thwarted ambition that led to her early death from alcoholism-related dementia. And of course, there’s the song, two relentlessly peppy melodies played over the same set of chords, written by the songwriting duo the Sherman Brothers, who also wrote the music for The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins, and The Jungle Book. It’s frequently voted among the most annoying in history, even though it’s probably less so than Walt’s original proposal for the ride, which was to have all the children of the world sing the national anthem in their native tongues simultaneously. But no matter how many reasons I can come up with for why It’s a Small World should not move me, no matter how much I cringe when I think about sobbing on a boat ride surrounded by animatronic children, one fact remains: I am still moved. The idea that a group of disparate people from various backgrounds — a brilliant yet frustrated alcoholic, Russian Jewish immigrant brothers, a raging anti-communist and probable antisemite — could come together and present such a simple and united vision of children as a force for peace, is deeply moving to me. The idea that Walt Disney — a man who sold a vision of optimism and progressivism, yet was so contemptuous of his employees’ right to unionize that he voluntarily testified against them in the 1947 HUAC hearings, even firing the animator who created Goofy; the man who is perhaps most responsible for contempt for the little guy being integrated into Disney’s DNA — could set aside his own noxious politics to help present a vision of a better world for children is deeply moving to me. The reminder that we were all children once, that we all started out believing in a better world, undergirds so much of Disney’s best work. I’m thinking of the final scene in Mary Poppins, when the wealth-and-status-obsessed banker father finally presents his children with the kite they’d been begging him to mend; or the moment in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves when the orphan Snow White has narrowly escaped a violent death, and she’s scared and alone in the forest until she meets a bunch of woodland creatures and vows to stay resolute, the chirpy orchestral chorus for “With a Smile and a Song.” “There’s no use in grumbling when raindrops come tumbling/Remember you’re the one who can fill the world with sunshine,” she sings, as the bunnies wag their tails and the chipmunks scrunch their noses and the birds marvel at the beauty and the robustness of the human spirit. Every time I sing those words to my own kids — and I mean every time — I can’t help but tear up a little bit. Because it’s not a message of blind optimism or shiny, happy ignorance in the face of despair or anything else people like to accuse the Disney corporation of promoting — or which it has arguably promoted in its approach to things like the Don’t Say Gay legislation. It’s a message of power. You are the one who can fill the world with sunshine. You are the one who can use your own imagination to remake the world however you see fit. It’s a message I wish I had taken more to heart when I was an anxious, sad, scared little kid; I wish I had believed that I could have built my own magic. Frankly, had I done so, it probably would have saved my parents a lot of money. Over and over and over again, I continue to give Disney money, because Disney continues to make things that move me. I believe in Disney magic. I believe in the power of smart, creative people coming together to tell good stories in new and interesting ways, to teach us who we are and who we were and who we would like to be; and in the capacity to reinvent the world as long as there is imagination left in it.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the US health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s (CVS) workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Sony has revealed that it already used machine learning in developing the 2023 game. By Hayley Williams on October 1, 2024 at 5:07AM PDT Sony's plans to augment its game-development process with AI and machine learning is already underway, the company revealed in its 2024 Company Report. In one example cited in the report, Sony used machine learning to augment the subtitling process for certain languages in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Sony has revealed it used voice-recognition software to automatically synchronize subtitles with their corresponding voice lines in certain languages, dramatically reducing the speed of the subtitling process. Spider-Man 2 launched with text support for 27 languages, with 12 of those also available in fully dubbed audio. The company said that this use of machine learning, a subset of AI computing, was part of a broader plan to "[deliver] our IP rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans." The segment of the report focuses on technologies that have the potential to improve efficiency in development processes, including AI and machine learning as well as real-time 3D processing, and sensing and capturing technology. Sony isn't the first to include AI in its development workflow, and it definitely won't be the last. EA has spoken on using AI in the development of this year's College Football 25 to automatically create models for the thousands of players who were included in the game. Microsoft is also all-in on AI, as is Amazon Games. Nintendo is one of the few major players in the industry to speak out against the use of AI in game development at this point. While so many companies are excited about the potential for AI in game development, few have touched on the potential impact it may have on the industry's human workforce, even as sweeping layoffs continue to impact developers and support staff across the industry. Video-game voice actors and mo-cap performers are currently on strike, with the use of AI a key concern for union SAG-AFTRA. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: The Human Cost Of Efficiency And Why It Should Matter To All Investors

A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems—Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon—Across Corporate America Man lying on the floor. Accident in warehouse With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business’s most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers. While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms—like discrimination, bias, and fairness—are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers’ seat to first understand and address these harms. The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article—the first in a series on AI and the workplace—focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors. The Promise of Algorithmic Management Systems Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry’s claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber’s 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly. A Slippery Slope A slippery slope of mud and melting snow. Photo Tim Clayton (Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty ... [+] Images) However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like “cogs in a machine” or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion. As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006). Why This Should Matter to Investors Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon Skillful worker attending brief meeting in the factory . Industrial people and manufacturing labor ... [+] concept . Amazon—the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization—is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management. Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other’s claims that Amazon’s high injury rates are linked to the company’s workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon’s “Time Off Task” (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates. During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked “Amazon Confidential” that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021—nearly 25% of Amazon’s 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon’s announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour—Amazon’s largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits—may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay. Because it’s challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let’s also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety. According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon’s rate of recordable injuries—the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)—was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon’s total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company’s warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon’s total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries. Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled “2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,” which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June—ending the week of Prime Day—the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon Organization and transportation in the warehouse Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance. In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow. As a case in point, two warehouses violating California’s Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon’s largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an “excessively intrusive” surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees’ scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as “excessive.” As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs. Spreading Like a Virus Coronavirus Covid-19 Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity. Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable “work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,” among other issues. The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles—which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools—aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk.

Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a “healthier” relationship with their work, compared to those who don’t use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who’s hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). “Knowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don’t,” HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. “It’s a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,” said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. “There are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,” he told Quartz.

But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. “There’s all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don’t want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that’s important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,” Altman said on the “How I Write” podcast hosted by David Perell.
