By Lambert Strether of Corrente. Bird Song of the Day Northern Mockingbird, Granville Schools Land Lab, Licking, Ohio, United States. “Song.” * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Transition “Axelrod: Second Trump administration has ‘wholly different feel'” [The Hill]. “‘Say what you will about the direction he wants to take the country but this is a wholly different feel from 2016. Trump is stocking his admin with seasoned loyalists who will not guide, but rather BE guided, by HIM,’ Axelrod posted to the social platform X. ‘People wanted to shake up Washington. For better or worse, they’re [going] to get what they asked for,’ he said.” • The difficulty that administrations have is that they have to administer, and to do that, they need administrators. How many heterodox policy experts are there who actually know where the levers of power are? Commentary: Tucker's very public campaign to get Trump to hire heterodox people seems to be losing to Trump's very public desire for the GOP to like him, a lot of safe picks, so far no wildcards. — Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) November 12, 2024 2024 Post Mortem From a Republican pollster, but AP Votecast data: The rundown of which groups swung right & didn't looks like an intersectional layercake of oppression. 😂 Old, white, married, educated people hold steady, young, nonwhite, single, and non-college educated people zoom right. pic.twitter.com/MU1u0RPDEj — Patrick Ruffini (@PatrickRuffini) November 12, 2024 So, a change election after all. “Exit Right” [Gabriel Winant, Dissent]. “Just as in 2016, Harris supporters have fallen back on the racism and sexism of American society as an explanation for defeat. No doubt these are hulking obstacles, but they don’t suffice as omnibus explanation…. [But] these are not static phenomena. Trump mobilizes these forces; the task of his opponent is to countermobilize and defeat them. A successful campaign draws on the material of the existing society and assembles it into a portrait of the present and a vision of the future: it does not simply reflect frozen facts of public opinion and common sense but reorganizes them and ultimately produces new forms.” And: “The pathologies of the Democrats, though, are in a sense not the result of errors. It is the structural role and composition of the party that produces its duplicitous and incoherent orientation. It is the mainstream party of globalized neoliberal capitalism, and at the same time, by tradition anyway, the party of the working class. As the organized power of the latter has been washed away, the commitment has become somewhat more aspirational: Harris notably cleaned up with the richest income bracket of voters.” And finally: “The demobilization of the Democratic electorate is thus the product of the party’s contradictory character at more than one level. The accountability of the Democrats to antagonistic constituencies produces both rhetorical incoherence—what does this party stand for?—and programmatic self-cancellation. Champions of the domestic rule of law and the rules-based international order, they engaged in a spectacular series of violations of domestic and international law. Promising a new New Deal, they admonished voters to be grateful for how well they were already doing economically. Each step taken by the party’s policymakers in pursuit of one goal imposes a limit in another direction. It is by this dynamic that a decade of (appropriate) anti-Trump hysteria led first to the adoption of parts of Trump’s program by the Democrats, and then finally his reinstallation as president at new heights of public opinion favorability. Nothing better than the real thing.” • With “globalized neoliberal capitalism,” Winant focuses on ideology, not class (i.e., the Democrat base in the PMC). Still, worth reading in full. * * * Deploy the Blame Cannons! Lambert here: In general, the lastest barrages of blame cannonry are better written than the previous hot take emisisons, not sure why. More to come! “Kamala Fell to the Same Cabal That Destroyed University Presidents” [Maureen Tkacik, The American Prospect]. “Time was you had Democrat billionaires, Republican billionaires, and opportunistic bipartisan billionaires. Republicans had the resource extraction guys and the Waltons and anyone who employed enough workers that they needed to bust unions; Democrats had Hollywood and Big Tech; both parties had joint custody of Wall Street. And the billionaires got what they wanted 99.9 percent of the time. This election was different. For all the venal raves the media bestowed upon Kamala Harris’s fundraising prowess, the whales near-universally lined up behind Trump. Of the top ten mega-donors, only the bottom two gave to Democrats; Trump’s haul from his own top ten donors—none of whom boasts the surname Koch or Thiel—amounted to about $945 million; Harris’s topped out at $254 million. (Harris ended up raising more money, thanks to Resistance giving, but Trump got to spend much less time raising it, and with Musk, he had the algorithms on his side.)” And: “At its heart, the billionaire revolt was the expression of a broader dissatisfaction with Joe Biden that was most surely rooted in the real, substantial, and (in the post–Cold War neoliberal era) unprecedented things his administration was quietly (too quietly!) doing for working people, small-business owners, and the proliferating subsistence entrepreneur class that falls somewhere in the middle. It sued Amazon for squeezing sellers to the bone while manipulating prices ever higher, Albertsons and Kroger for conspiring to gouge shoppers by littering the country with dead strip centers where supermarkets once stood, Live Nation for indenturing a generation of young musicians and turning tickets to concerts and sports events into luxury goods, Welsh Carson (the most powerful private equity firm in health care) for gouging hospital patients and suppressing the wages of anesthesiologists in multiple states, and more. It even got a court to label Google a monopolist. This stuff was extremely popular, and Democratic leaders never talked about it, likely because it pissed off the donor class—which is of course the very reason they should have been talking about nothing else.” And: “In any event, though, the billionaires weaponized toxic wokeness to make themselves seem more receptive and in touch with Normal Dudes than the Democrats, who unbeknownst to most Normal Dudes had actually been working tirelessly on behalf of the common man while Joe Biden was preoccupied wringing his hands over why Bibi was being so mean to him.” • I like this piece a lot, but I’m not sure how much I buy “working tirelessly on behalf of the common man,” since I think it proceeds from the very, very low baseline set by Obama. I would never trash the efforts of the Lina Khan and the anti-trusters; they are tireless, but the Democrat Party as a whole? The successful deep-sixing of a million disproportionately working class deaths from Covid tells the tale. “Kamala Harris ran the Fyre Festival of campaigns” [The Spectator]. “As the finger-pointing begins, and the autopsy of the Kamala Harris campaign continues, financial details are being released on how the Harris campaign managed to blow more than $1 billion in war-chest funds — and not only lose, but get wiped off the electoral map by Donald Trump, who ended his campaign with roughly $488 million. That’s not a Dr. Evil typo: Kamala Harris not only blew a billion dollars, but actually ended up $20 million in debt. Where did the money all go? To celebrities mostly, and elaborate sets and stages. As it turns out, not all of those celebrity “activists” appeared with Kamala Harris because they believed in her or were doing their civic duty by getting engaged. They charged fees — and some were astronomical. Harris made elaborate promises to her crowds about celebrity performances. Crowds were brought in with the promise of seeing Beyoncé perform, only to leave disappointed. It was all a financial ruse, much like the infamous Fyre Festival of 2017… the Harris campaign spent upwards of six figures to build a custom set for her appearance on the Call Me Daddy podcast, which only netted about 800,000 downloads. Meanwhile, Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast — and his interview has got more than 47 million views on YouTube. There were seven swing-state concerts that involved high-priced performers — Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Jon Bon Jovi, Ricky Martin and more — who seemingly ended up costing the Harris campaign more than $20 million on event production alone, and reportedly even more on paying the celebrities to appear. Even Oprah Winfrey charged the campaign $1 million to show up. The campaign went so far into debt that the campaign was reportedly forced to scrap Canadian Nineties indie-pop singer Alanis Morissette to save money. The pop concert campaign strategy is said to have been the brainchild of former Obama advisors on the campaign.” • Ironic [chortles]. “Is said to have been” by whom? * * * “Why Was There a Broad Drop-Off in Democratic Turnout in 2024?” [New York Times]. “Mr. Trump won the White House not only because he turned out his supporters and persuaded skeptics, but also because many Democrats sat this election out, presumably turned off by both candidates. Counties with the biggest Democratic victories in 2020 delivered 1.9 million fewer votes for Ms. Harris than they had for Mr. Biden. The nation’s most Republican-heavy counties turned out an additional 1.2 million votes for Mr. Trump this year, according to the analysis of the 47 states where the vote count is largely complete. The drop-off spanned demographics and economics. It was clear in counties with the highest job growth rates, counties with the most job losses and counties with the highest percentage of college-educated voters. Turnout was down, too, across groups that are traditionally strong for Democrats — including areas with large numbers of Black Christians and Jewish voters. The decline in key cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, made it exceptionally difficult for Ms. Harris to win the battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania.” And: In Pennsylvania, the biggest electoral prize on the battleground map, Mr. Trump’s victory received an outsize boost from an unlikely place — the five counties with the highest percentage of registered Democrats: Allegheny, Delaware, Lackawanna, Montgomery and Philadelphia. Ms. Harris won these counties, but not by the margins needed to overcome Republican-heavy areas of the state. Total turnout was down from 2020 in all five Democratic strongholds, which could partly explain how Ms. Harris received 78,000 fewer votes than Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump added 24,000 votes to his total in these same counties. Holy moley! And it’s the same story in other swing states. What a debacle. “The common national experience that explains Trump’s 2024 gains” [Ronald Brownstein, CNN]. “But the scale of Trump’s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country — a shared disappointment in the results generated by President Joe Biden’s administration…. But since then, [UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavrec] said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 — and then back toward him in 2024 — points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president’s performance four years later.” • Throw the bums out! “In the Race for the Presidency, GOP Turnout Declined, Democratic Turnout Collapsed” [Daily Yonder]. “Donald Trump won the popular vote and the presidency by getting nearly as many votes this year as he did in 2020, while Democratic turnout – especially in major cities – collapsed, a Daily Yonder analysis of preliminary election returns shows. Kamala Harris got 12 million fewer votes than Joe Biden did in 2020, a decline of 15%, according to a preliminary analysis of 46 states. Trump, meanwhile, lost only 1 million votes, compared to his 2020 returns, a decline of less than 2%.” • Handy chart, broken down by county type: * * * “Even Fox News Saw a Close 2024 Election. Then the Voting Data Came In” [Variety]. “‘At 5 p.m., the most likely outcome was a very close election,’ says Arnon Mishkin, who has directed Fox News’ decision desk for years. ‘Different people looked at the data and said this could tilt Trump and this could tilt Harris.’ Within hours, however, a different story was unspooling — and viewers of Fox News were early to hear it being told. Fox News was able to call many states earlier than many of its competitors, including a critical loss by the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania in the wee hours of the morning that largely decided the race in favor of Trump.How so? The company made a big investment in new voter technology last decade that relies less on exit polls, and more on on-the-ground data from each state.” • I ran into a similar problem in my own (not to be pompous) methodology; I didn’t prepare readers for the scope of Trump’s victory, e.g. winning all swing states. I wrote that up yesterday, but started with a metaphor about the death of Saruman, which I butchered, out of haste. I have since corrected it, and readers who were justifibly confused can read what I meant to say here (which I feel is important or I wouldn’t be harping on it). * * * “Judge delays Trump immunity decision in NY hush money case” [The Hill]. “A New York judge delayed a Tuesday decision on whether President-elect Trump’s conviction can withstand the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, following his election victory last week. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to freeze the case until Nov. 19, newly public court records show, enabling prosecutors to respond to Trump’s demand the case be dismissed entirely now that he is president-elect. Trump’s sentencing, which would be the first of any former president, is scheduled for Nov. 26. He was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to conceal an affair, which he denies. Trump’s attorneys believe his election as president compels the dismissal of his criminal prosecutions. ‘The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern,’ Trump attorney Emil Bove wrote in an email to the judge.” • Maybe Trump could make a short jail stay work for him, carrying on the stellar work he did at McDonald’s and driving the garbage truck. Merchan could send him to jail for a day, to underline respect for the process blah blah blah, and Trump would enter Rikers — in an orange jumpsuit, naturally — to a cheering throng of inmates and guards, and then Merchan could put him on probation, and everybody could stand down and forget about this farrago of bad law and political prosecution. Democrats en Déshabillé “The model exactly predicted the most likely election map” [Nate Silver]. But that’s not the interesting part. In a footnote: “I essentially got to perform a randomized control trial on how partisans in both camps reacted to good and bad news. And there was an asymmetry. Republicans are generally happy when you agree with them partway or half the time. Admittedly, the sorts of Republicans who encounter our work are not a representative sample, probably being on the moderate side — though you can find plenty of Trump supporters in the Silver Bulletin comments section. Democrats, however — and here, I’m not referring so much to Silver Bulletin subscribers but in the broader universe online — often get angry with you when you only halfway agree with them. And I really think this difference in personality profiles tells you a little something about why Trump won: Trump was happy to take on all comers, whereas with Democrats, disagreement on any hot-button topic (say, COVID school closures or Biden’s age) will have you cast out as a heretic. That’s not a good way to build a majority, and now Democrats no longer have one.” • Democrats, as we would expect, are doubling down on this behavior: There’s a concerted effort to move high(er)-traffic accounts off Twitter onto Blue Sky, as if the world needed more Democrat embubblement than it already has. Further, for all its many faults, Elon Musk’s hell-site still has a very functional Covid-conscious community, which these trolls would end up splitting, not that such a thing would matter to them. Brunch at Blue Sky! “The US Is a Civic Desert. To Survive, the Democratic Party Needs to Transform Itself.” [Pete Davis, The Nation]. The deck: “The party should jettison its consultant class and move toward a local-membership model that would help to rejuvenate civic life across the country.” More: “Here’s one sketch of how we could begin to turn this around: The 4 Ms of party membership, each symbolic of a necessary mindset shift. First, Membership Cards. When you join the Labour Party in Britain, you get mailed a welcome packet, complete with a membership card and information about how to get more involved. The Democratic Party could learn from this: It should mean something to join the Democrats. … Second, Maps. There should be an accountable Democratic captain for every neighborhood in the country…. Third, Meeting Halls. Monthly meetings should be designed with utmost care. Best practices for making meetings, working groups, and annual calendars warm and engaging should be gathered and disseminated. Formal rules and procedures should not be fetishized at the expense of engaging new members. … Finally, Mutual Aid. The party should directly care for members and for the broader community. Democrats should do disaster relief, take on homeless-shelter shifts, cook food when members have a baby, welcome new immigrants to town, and host block parties throughout the year. … This is all easier dreamed than realized. Fostering a culture of membership is a long-haul project—more like the planting of acorns than the planting of sunflower seeds.” • Dude. When Labour UK becmae a membership organization, they got Jeremy Corbyn, and who wants that?

Stay safe out there! Airborne Transmission: H5N1 “Dependence of aerosol-borne influenza A virus infectivity on relative humidity and aerosol composition” [Frontiers in Microbiology]. They have a fancy new machine: “We describe a novel biosafety aerosol chamber equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation for bubble-bursting aerosol generation, size distribution measurement, and condensation-growth collection to minimize sampling artifacts when measuring virus infectivity in aerosol particles.” Interestingly: “Despite decades of research, there remains great difficulty in identifying and understanding the factors that control the spread of influenza epidemics, which occur each year in both hemispheres. In this study, we aimed to simulate exhalation, airborne residence, and re-inhalation of IAV-containing particles as accurately as possible. As an initial step, we specifically used purely saline aerosol particles to avoid the complexity of natural matrices. We revealed large discrepancies between aerosol-borne viruses and previous microliter droplet experiments performed with similar matrices. The discrepancies between aerosol and deposited droplet experiments need to be explained in order to obtain a reliable model for aerosol transmission.” • Thanks, droplet dogmatists. Maskstravaganza Smile Nazis in music: There should be only music spreading in the air, not Covid. — Adam Wong (@Engineer_Wong) November 8, 2024 Testing and Tracking: H5N1 “Bird flu infections in farmworkers are going undetected, study shows” [STAT]. “[CDC] findings, published Thursday, suggest that a small but not insignificant number of H5N1 infections are going undetected among people who work with dairy cows. Blood samples taken from 115 farm workers in Michigan and Colorado over the summer found evidence of a recent infection in eight individuals — half of whom recalled being ill around the same time the cows were sick. The other half could not recall having any symptoms.” Serological surveys. More: “In response to the new data, the CDC is now recommending that any farm workers who were exposed to infected animals be tested for H5N1, whether or not they have symptoms. Previously, the agency advised that only individuals who had been exposed and had symptoms be tested. The purpose of this expansion is to intensify case-finding efforts, so that even workers with mild or unnoticeable infections can be offered treatment and isolation. The CDC is also recommending that Tamiflu be offered to any individuals on a farm with infected animals who’ve had a high-risk exposure — like being splashed with milk from a dairy cow or participating in a culling operation on a poultry farm — without adequate personal protective equipment. The CDC’s study found that all eight people with H5N1 antibodies had reported cleaning milking parlors, and most reported milking cows. None of them reported wearing respiratory protection and fewer than half wore eye protection.” Elite Maleficence “ASHRAE Standard 62: tobacco industry’s influence over national ventilation standards” [Tobacco Control]. BMJ 2002 (!). From the Abstract: ” The tobacco industry has been involved in the development of ventilation standards for over 20 years. It has successfully influenced the standard and continues to attempt to change the standard from a smoke-free framework into an “accommodation” framework. The industry acts directly and through consultants and allies. The major health groups have been largely absent and the health interests have been poorly represented in standard development. While concentrated in the USA, ASHRAE standards are adopted worldwide.” • Commentary: “Learned and Unlearned Lessons in Quality and Safety From Hospitals’ COVID-19 Burdens” (Invited Commentary) [JAMA]. “[S]till absent from the peer-reviewed literature is a discussion of the importance of hospital quality performance reporting and benchmarking in times of crisis as a mechanism to ensure safety. Hospitals in the US were effectively relieved of their obligations to provide high-quality pandemic-era care when pay-for-performance programs, rankings, and ratings excluded months of pandemic-era data from their method. Though ostensibly made with benign intent, these decisions to exclude pandemic-era quality-reporting data were not patient centered and may not have been methodologically necessary. The findings of Metersky et al demonstrate that quality and safety data are needed more than ever during times of crisis. This would allow patients and payers to understand which hospitals have resilient systems in order to make informed decisions about where they choose to receive and fund health care.” Fortunately: “With hospital-specific COVID-19 admissions data from HHS coupled with patient-level Medicare or other electronic health record or claims data, it is still possible to recreate the unreported pandemic-era quality outcomes benchmarks to identify resilient hospitals, systems, and processes during surge capacity. In fact, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ FY 2025 Inpatient Prospective Payment System Proposed Rule will extend the COVID-19 admissions data to include data for all respiratory illnesses.” IPC = Infection Prevention and Control.

Stats Watch There are no official statistics of interest today. * * * Antitrust: “How Albertsons Kills Rural Grocers with Land Use Restrictions” [Matt Stoller, BIG]. “[S]upermarket executives see rural markets as particularly easy to monopolize, because there is often just one store. They even have a name, “no-comp[etition] or low-comp[etition] zones,” according to one executive on the stand. Of course that makes sense, we’d expect firms to maximize profits where they can. One might be tempted to say, well, there are some towns that can’t support more than one store. And that might be true, except that there are several examples of supermarket chains using tactics in such towns to thwart the opening of competition. How? Well, they find a way to dominate the existing plots of land and buildings suitable for such a store. In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, fined Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington. As part of the sale, the supermarket giant put a requirement on the deed that no grocery store could open there until 2038. Ferguson found this provision was a violation of the state antitrust law. These kinds of land use restrictions are likely common. A few months ago, I got an email from an economist focused on rural areas, who explained how Albertsons abuses its market power in a series of small skiing towns in rural California using a similar strategy.” Manufacturing: “Boeing reaches settlement to avert civil trial in 2019 Max crash” [Straits Times]. “The crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane killed 157 people. The trial was set to begin on Nov 12 in Chicago. It originally involved six plaintiffs but until now all but one had settled, according to a source familiar with the case. The hearing on Nov 12 will take place to inform Judge Jorge Alonso of the settlement, who must approve the deal for it to be officially settled, the source said. ‘It is a damage-only trial, meaning no evidence regarding the liability of Boeing will be presented,’ the source told AFP.” • Too bad. Manufacturing: “Boeing Got The Easy Part Done. Now Comes The Tougher, Existential Problems” [Seattle Medium]. “Boeing is America’s largest exporter, and therefore very exposed to any trade war. China is the largest global market for new aircraft purchases, with Boeing forecasting that China’s fleet of commercial jets will double in the next 20 years. The aircraft maker has been down this road before. The company’s sales to China ground to a near-halt in 2017 as trade tensions between the two countries escalated during Trump’s first term. Orders from Chinese buyers fell from 64 in 2016 to 51 in 2017 to zero in both 2018 and 2019. A similar drop could occur if a new trade war breaks out. ‘We really don’t know what Trump will do with Chinese tariffs,’ said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an industry consultant. ‘But if he slaps 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods, the quickest way for China to retaliate is to switch to (Boeing rival) Airbus for 100% of its needs.’ Boeing has seen a modest resumption of sales and deliveries to China recently, with 20 orders in 2021 and 15 in 2023. So far this year it has 53 deliveries to China, up from 35 in the four previous years combined.” Manufacturing: “Employees across Boeing face sweeping layoffs this week” [Seattle Times]. “Boeing employees will learn Wednesday who will lose their jobs in mid-January in the round of layoffs Boeing announced last month. The cuts will be broadly spread across the company and, despite some expectations earlier, engineers and production workers won’t be exempt…. But a Boeing senior engineering manager in St. Louis said the cuts in the works target a roughly 10% reduction across the engineers supporting military programs, including the F-15 and F/A-18 jet fighters and the Navy’s P-8 submarine hunter, which is built in Renton with military systems installed in Seattle. Those engineering organizations will shrink, said the manager, who asked not to be identified to protect his job. “If the idea in Kelly’s mind is cutting overhead and programs will not be impacted, that’s not what’s happening.’…. Still, it’s clear non-front-line positions will suffer bigger losses. And white-collar staff working remotely may be particularly targeted as Ortberg tries to get the workforce connected and aligned with his new direction. A manager of a small team of about 15 people, all working remotely — and ironically focused on ways to improve efficiency in program management — told one employee to expect a 30% cut in his team. ‘If we are not holding a wrench, if we’re considered overhead, it’s about 30%,’ said the employee, who also asked not to be identified to protect his job. The reduction for ‘people working on planes might be less than 5%.'” Manufacturing: “Boeing delivers fewest planes since 2020, warns factory restart after strike will take weeks” [CNBC]. “As the workers return, Boeing has to assess potential hazards, restate machinist duties and safety requirements, and ensure that all training qualifications are current, a spokesman said. ‘It’s much harder to turn this on than it is to turn it off,’ CEO Kelly Ortberg said during the company’s quarterly call last month. ‘So it’s absolutely critical that we do this right.'” * * * Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 69 Greed (previous close: 67 Greed) [CNN].

Photo Book “Leaving and Waving” [Deanna Dikeman]. “For 27 years, I took photographs as I waved good-bye and drove away from visiting my parents at their home in Sioux City, Iowa. I started in 1991 with a quick snapshot, and I continued taking photographs with each departure. I never set out to make this series. I just took these photographs as a way to deal with the sadness of leaving. It gradually turned into our good-bye ritual. And it seemed natural to keep the camera busy, because I had been taking pictures every day while I was there. These photographs are part of a larger body of work I call Relative Moments, which has chronicled the lives of my parents and other relatives since 1986. When I discovered the series of accumulated “leaving and waving” photographs, I found a story about family, aging, and the sorrow of saying good-bye. In 2009, there is a photograph where my father is no longer there. He passed away a few days after his 91st birthday. My mother continued to wave good-bye to me. Her face became more forlorn with my departures. In 2017, my mother had to move to assisted living. For a few months, I photographed the good-byes from her apartment door. In October of 2017 she passed away. When I left after her funeral, I took one more photograph, of the empty driveway. For the first time in my life, no one was waving back at me.” Zeitgeist Watch “Why Close Reading is An Essential Part of Literary Translation” [Literary Hub]. “Reading—’this fruitful miracle of communication in the bosom of solitude,’ as Proust called it in a translator’s preface— is miraculously and mysteriously neither objective nor subjective, neither purely taking something in nor purely revealing or expressing what’s inside oneself. It is a complex interplay of the self and the world, analogous to perception—we see what’s really there in the world, but we see it, and it’s there in our world, the environment we move in and care about, which is different from the environment of any other person or animal in the same physical space.” • Take that, influencers! Class Warfare “The ‘Happiness Plateau’ Doesn’t Exist” [Bloomberg]. “[T]he latest academic work chips away at the idea that there is a plateau, just as previous academic work chipped away at the idea of happy peasants and miserable bourgeois. Matthew Killingsworth, of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, has amassed a sample of more than one million real-time reports of experienced well-being in the US (compiled by getting people to report their day-to-day well-being on their smartphones). In a 2021 paper he studied 33,000 people who provided such real-time evidence and discovered three things: that there is no evidence of a divergence between evaluative and real-time well-being; that real-time well-being rises linearly with income and, third, that the slope is just as steep above $80,000 a year as below. The idea of a happiness plateau is for the birds: Higher incomes are clearly associated with both feeling better on a day-to-day basis and being more satisfied with your life overall. What about people who earn well above $80,000? In a new paper Killingsworth compares the reported life-satisfaction of his sample of 33,000 Americans with a wide variety of incomes with the reported life-satisfaction of two groups of ultra-wealthy individuals: millionaires from around the world and members of the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. His conclusions are well-summarized in the title of his study: ‘Money and Happiness: Extended Evidence against Satiation.’ Truly wealthy people are significantly happier than the highest earners in the ordinary income group if you take ‘life satisfaction’ as a meaningful measure of happiness. Moreover, the happiness gap between truly wealthy people and middle-income earners is three times as large as the happiness gap between middle and low-income groups. We not only get happier as we move from the middle-income herd to the Succession crowd, but we get a lot happier. Killingsworth’s study is not perfect: There is such a shortage of evidence about the well-being of the truly wealthy that one of the studies he relies on, of the Forbes 400, dates from 1985 (the other is from 2018). But never has the phrase ‘more research is required’ sounded more attractive.” • If there were in fact a happiness plateau, would there not also tend to be a capital accumulation plateau for capitalist owners? There doesn’t seem to be.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Remember the last week – and the FEMA employee directing the Milton response team to avoid Florida homes that got overlooked. Things just got a lot more interesting……. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5SP0jIZPs0 The fired employee is refusing to go under the bus calmly. I would possibly call her a whistleblower. It appears she was following orders from headquarters – and this was also happening in NC and other places. Hoo Boy! All those silent Trump voters lying to pollsters and the dearth of Trump signs in yards – the MAGA crowd may have more IQ than the PMC think. Again, who am I going to believe – the employee under the bus OR yet another branch of this Administration and the lapdog national media who seem to lie about almost everything. Thanks very much for the link Doc. It gives good information about the FEMA process. This whole program is 2 1/2 hours but the interview starts at 10 minutes in. The phrase or term “hostile work environment” seems overly broad, much like claims of “micro aggressions” have been used in the past as a weapon against others. Granted, if someone is pointing a gun at you, that is a reason to leave, but abandoning neighborhoods merely because some people are acting emotionally after a natural disaster is bad. And there is a question I really want the answer to….. Did all of these celebrities like Bon Jovi and Springsteen and Oprah charge the Obama campaign and the Biden campaign the same millions or is this something new? Because if they did not, it appears to me that the Kamala campaign may have been one of the largest money-laundering schemes in history. This really needs to be investigated. Is it against the law for celebrities like Oprah to appear and say nothing publicly about it being paid, and then take what seems to be obscene amounts under the table? It’s OK when they do it. That is another aspect of campaign spending that sorely needs to be addressed: any entity getting more than (picking a random reasonable number) $10,000 has to list all of its owners, unless it’s a publicly traded company. No more hiding behind LLCs. Someone(s) in the consultant class are sobbing all the way back home while counting their cash—-while I imagine some small-time bakery gets stiffed and becomes one of the creditors holding the Harris campaign’s $20 million bag. > No more hiding behind I still insist that in 2020, after being stabbed in the back by the Democrats, Sanders should have pivoted to riding the wave of labor organizing that was rising at the same time the pandemic was. I think he could have made the case to his base, and his base would have accepted it, particularly with a focus on protecting the working class from the ravages of Covid in the workplace. As it is… I won’t say that the well for a Sanders-style campaign based entirely on small donations has been poisoned irretrievably, given how horrid the current system is, but honestly, what did people get? (Perhaps the small donor concept should be redirected to an institution, more or less permanent, as opposed to a campaign, temporary by definition). I have trouble seeing why that’d be against any law. If Obama can charge millions in speaking fees for showing up at corporate and other hubbubs, why not? (I have to imagine Obama had to go bona fide for political campaigns, but that’s sort of his job as a Dem insider, but talking politics is not Oprah’s or Beyonce’s job. Um, maybe you missed this, but this is from when Stephen Colbert was a “better” comedian. In this clip he starts a super PAC, and can take any and all amounts of money from corporations: Comedy Central’s “Colbert Super PAC” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxvjL7KJlk The lawyer helping him is pretty much the guy that wrote the law. Later on, Stephen signs a few more forms with the same lawyer (after the election) and all the remaining super PAC money becomes his money (there might be a few shell corporations in this). All entirely legal, has been for years. (I’m looking for that clip – I think it’s been scrubbed out of existence.) Haven’t you ever wondered where all the money goes AFTER the election, or why elections seem to cost more and more? Here’s the shell corporation: Comedy Central’s “Colbert Super PAC”: Stephen’s Shell Corporation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOeChlhbhg And here’s the whole saga. Now what they gloss over in this by saying “he donated the money to charity” is that it was HIS MONEY TO GIVE at the end: Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC Lessons | Long Story Short | NBC News https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy7TUtlPmqk I still cannot find the clips where he signed a couple forms and the money was his – I should have save that. For all we know, the first time Trump ran it was just for the PR, and the MONEY. I’m not sure he expected to win. Just a little coda – because I’m not trying to belittle Trump – like him or not, he is now a giant in American politics, and good for him. I think Trump’s 2016 election was about an American public that was thoroughly disgusted with the corruption that Colbert demonstrated in both parties (the uniparty). The American public is not dumb, and they are very tired of getting screwed, so Trump, who was pretty straight forward about calling out the corruption, won. i agree with all you said….i remember trump at 3am or whatever(2016) with a real, authentic* ‘i caught the car’ look. he wanted his narcissistic supply, and got it…but then was expected to govern? pure dying empire mode,lol. (* you could tell it was authentic because, altho i never paid him much mind, he was ubiquitous, and was never, in my mind, to be associated with that word…i could almost see the cartoon thoughtbubble:”oh shit”) If you look at presidential elections over the past 30 years the winners oscillate between Democrats and Republicans. The electorate keeps hoping against hope that things will change, but they never do. Trump will prove to be a disappointment and so a Democrat will likely be elected POTUS in 2028. And the beat goes on. > Trump, who was pretty straight forward about calling out the corruption, won. This from Dave Chappelle is a hardy perennial, and not wrong: Won’t you come and join the Party Commentary on “Not Like Us” (a “Diss Track”). Drake is bad Is that bad good or bad bad? I’d like to know this too. I thought I was cynical enough and informed enough that nothing would surprise me. But hearing celebs were paid to endorse Harris actually has me a little surprised. I could see if it was pay for a performance, but Beyonce getting $10mil to come out and say “vote for Kamala” is nuts! I can’t believe there isn’t a disclosure requirement. Well, this is ‘Merica…I guess I can. Also, great to see the numbers. I remember all the crowing about how much they were raising. Didn’t do squat for ’em. Just like Hillary 2016. Heh. Never heard of paying celebrity endorsers but I’m too old to understand modern politics. This is strongly suggestive of Hollywood having a business relationship with, if not the Democrats then with the people the Democrats report to. When I worked with the Kennedy in ’80 campaign it was a no-brainer to give the “driving Sally Field” gig to one of our female union stewards that we’d been trying to talk into joining our local’s COPE committee. That was 1980 and the use of celebrity surrogates was somewhat edgy but Norma Rae was a popular movie and Field was on board. To the absolute best of my knowledge Field did this at her own expense and our driver did not get paid by the union or the factory although Field probably thought that was the case. Everyone always assumed you were getting paid if you took time off work for a campaign. Can’t cite the rules but that was a no-no. Not only do high level volunteers do so without pay, they usually do so at significant personal cost to themselves. If they have money, they donate both time and money to the campaign. And they don’t talk about that because no one needs to know those things. When you’re not being paid, it empowers you to, well, take my word for it — it empowers you. The current “everyone must get paid” bull excrement was put in place as part of a manufacturered higher wages for campaign workers movement that’s less than a decade old and which was created to push volunteers (witnesses) out of campaign spaces. Raising pay made the jobs more valuable and instead of selectively recruiting staff from existing experienced former staff/volunteers, the party and the various campaigns started doing crony hires. If I have a problem with 2020 vote tallies, it’s because I know for a fact that the Democrat party lacked the qualified staff to pull off a massive ballot harvest. My guess would be that countless NGOs used staff interfacing with poors to provide contracted for services plus help with filling out and casting ballots. It’s all — in my opinion — crooked as hell but when you don’t know how to win elections, cheating probably seems like the best option. > If I have a problem with 2020 vote tallies, it’s because I know for a fact that the Democrat party lacked the qualified staff to pull off a massive ballot harvest.

Interesting hypothesis (and akin to the role NGOs play in placing migrants, as contractors, entirely under the radar). And not, naturally, covered at all, the NGOsphere being a pillar of the Democrat Party, not to mention Little Madison’s workplace after Oberlin. This is an evolving story. Unsurprisingly it is being picked up on all right wing news and related websites and they may be stretching things quite a bit. Still, even the Washington Examiner is quoting FEC filings reporting that the Harris campaign gave $1 million to Harpo Productions (Oprah’s company). Oprah has publicly stated that doesn’t mean she was paid $1 million. Right. Of course not. Regular people understand how someone paying the company you own and profit from doesn’t mean you were paid… Of the amounts people are pulling from FEC filings appears to be production related expenses for various Ms. Harris’ appearance. For example, on the Call Her Daddy podcast. Those expenses are allegedly related to a $6 million payment for a mediocre looking set. Donors have every right to be furious about this. $6 million spent to help down ballot candidates could have dramatically altered a lot of contests. Pretty sure Trump didn’t have to pay the Podcasters he visited to speak on their shows. Pretty sure all of the celebrities Harris worked with were wealthy enough to donate time and production assistance if they come to. Pretty sure Harris is an idiot and she deserves people calling her out on this grift. I hope all her post election fundraising fails and she has to pay the bill for her failure. Stopping Hitler and saving democracy is important, but you’re not expecting me to do it for free, are you? Not for nothing, but Oprah still has an entire production company. I can think of nothing done for Harris that should have cost a million. Especially as Winfrey could have provided everything at cost, if not fronted it herself. (The one set cost I saw cited would bankrupt most film and television if every set cost that. and even if it wasn’t necessarily from Harpo.) Someday, when the deluded Harris supporters finally recover, Oprah’s reputation may finally be toast. One of the richest women around not only foisted a losing idea on the public, she had to be richly paid to do it. I would think they will finally go Dr. Oz, Dr Phil, liquid diets, Harris…why did we ever think she knew diddly. Cripes she was GOOP before Paltrow. I’ll bet she does know Diddy though. $6 million spent to help down ballot candidates could have dramatically altered a lot of contests. Could have at one time, but the people who knew how to actually GOTV were run out of the Democrat party years ago. The institutional memory, the skills, the techniques — all gone. The Democrats have outsourced their GOTV operations to phony hacks with no clue how to organize voters. Sure, the celebrity campaign was a boondoggle — the spectacle of a Hollywood billionaire, the richest person in the entertainment industry shaking down a political candidate for a pittance she could spend on lunch, was particularly skeevy. And you can multiply that many times over, as the article so fascinatingly does by listing all the has-beens and never-weres that the campaign thought would win them the election. It’s pathetic and indicative of their out-of-touchness that in the end they couldn’t secure an appearance by Alannis Morrisette. Don’t tell me — Hootie and the Blowfish and Courtney Love weren’t available? But the celebrity campaign is really just the bright shiny example, it doesn’t tell the whole story. All the money that Democrats *do* put into the mechanics of campaigns is stupidly spent. They spend it on “data science”. On “new” methods and techniques. On “things and tools” as Harris so eloquently formulated it: databases, targeted ads, shrill fundraising emails, phone calls, text messages. On occasion, they actually knock on doors. But now they only allow “professionals” to do that, and no matter what town you’re in, despite all the “data” they’re armed with, those professionals don’t know anything about you, or your neighborhood, or your town, or what’s important to you. And on the rare occasions that someone opens the door, the “professionals” make it obvious that they don’t care about any of that, either. They’re just about putting you in a box, like “5S” so they can congratulate themselves like a helicopter parent does a toddler (“good job”) before moving on to the next door, where probably no one will answer and they’ll just leave another door hanger. That’s Democrat “voter outreach” now. That’s “engagement”. Show your support for our campaign by “liking” us on BookFace. Get involved with our campaign by buying the merch. Granted, annoying text messages are small-bore compared to genocide, COVID shot mandates, inflation, rigged politics, censorship, saber-rattling, corruption, child poverty, union bashing, hippie punching, and a Dick Cheney endorsement. With such a longass list, any one of those Darwin Award moves could have done in the Democrats by itself. But all those expensive, “innovative”, forward-looking “tools” can’t make up for a cruel, boneheaded, tone-deaf politics. And that’s where Democrat money goes. Another $6 million wouldn’t have made a damn bit of difference with these bozos. They would have gotten better use of all that money by burning it to heat their offices. > All the money that Democrats *do* put into the mechanics of campaigns is stupidly spent. They spend it on “data science”. On “new” methods and techniques. On “things and tools” as Harris so eloquently formulated it: databases, targeted ads, shrill fundraising emails, phone calls, text messages. Apparently, Democrats now believe that politics is not local; fitting for a globalist party. This tallies with not giving the Democrat capo in Philly walking around money. No walking around money? In Philly? Really? And sure enough, they did badly. It also fits with a mindset that equates large donations with effectiveness, both as a candidate and a legislator. Now with the payments to celebrities, and probably donor owned tech companies and probably donor run NGOs, I am reminded of an Ourbourus, Every thing circles the donations. The donor class gives the candidate money which they use to beg donations from small donors, so they can hire consultants and producers and NGOs for the campaign giving much of the money back to the donor class. But without an “honest liar” as a candidate it is just a snake eating its own tail. Everyone gets their cut, except the small donors, as millions and now billions are spent to elect no one. Or even if they do get elected, their time is spent setting up the next circle. Just in case.

The coffee was served in Restaurant El Forcat, C. Roteros 12 in Valencia (sigh, I was there about 1 week before the terrible flooding). Wonder what other slogans they have on their packets? If Lee above is right is a company from Granada. Doesn’t surprise me. “Even Oprah Winfrey charged the campaign $1 million to show up.” Trump might be Hitler-adjacent and a danger to democracy but in neoliberal hell-world the bag must still be secured. (…with apologies to Sally Field) You like me {hands over a million bucks} you really like me! Oprah claims that she was not paid a dime by the Harris campaign. …on the grounds that it went not to her, but to her production company. I remember reading somewhere that when a major corporation is on the edge of death and every officer knows it, there is a better chance of a woman being appointed to be the captain who either rescues the ship or goes down with it. To paraphrase Bugs Bunny from a cartoon I remember . . . ” If its the Captain’s Mess, let her clean it up”. Or go down with it. I wonder if deeply secret private polling showed the Democratic Strategerists that ” this sucker is going down”, in the deathless words of Dubya Bush. And if the sucker is going down, why not let Kamala Harris be the Captain, since she wants it so bad. One thing for sure, in the widest scope, Kamala did not create and fill the sewage lagoon she ended up drowning in. 4 decades of New Yuppie Scumocrats and Clintobamacrats did that, step by careful step. Strangely, or not, I feel no sadness that Kamala drowned in the sewage lagoon. I am sad that she was not joined in that fate by so many deserving Democrats and Democrat parasites. Well, I feel no personal sadness for her, to be sure. She knew the risks and she took her chances. I feel sad for us in that her defeat means TrumpenVance’s victory , and people who thought things couldn’t get worse will feel just how much worse things can get. That’s why I voted for Harris.

Best thing for everyone. “Best thing for everyone.” Hmmm…. This sounds a bit too close to G–less Communism to we members of the “Committee For the Suppression of Choice.” (Your contributions not tax deductible.) It’s a conflict resolution variant. i agree. the ballot measures tell a much larger tale than we’ve heard, so far. like the Pew findings over the years that even most gop voters want universal healthcare. we remain unrepresented. and all this yelling about how the country failed kamalamadingdong sure as hell aint helping. at least we havent gotten to the russian interference stage(tm). i find that part particularly tiring. and the Gabriel Winant thing in Dissent is really good…really long, but really good…especially where he starts quoting Stuart Hall and Brecht. The Winant thing: > The Democrats, in other words, comprehensively failed to set the terms of ideological debate in any respect. > It is the structural role and composition of the party that produces its duplicitous and incoherent orientation. It is the mainstream party of globalized neoliberal capitalism, and at the same time, by tradition anyway, the party of the working class. Silly me, I was thinking they didn’t have an ideology, just targets. But I was paying attention to their words. I agree with Lambert, with the caveat that ‘globalized neoliberal capitalism’ is that which Must Not Be Spoke. Because class is implicit, and it’s the opposite of ‘local workers’. back when i was politically active locally…2001 til around 2009 or 10(whenever obamacare turned into what it became)…i was quite the starchild among the local dems(and libertarians and what i call, variously, the front porch/small-c/russel kirk/wendell berry conservatives(such egalitarianism/ecumenicism was unknown to each group, and is in itself pretty remarkable. i’m proud of it))…wrote a lot of letters to the editor of the local brochure, which were printed…influenced, thereby, a few local policy things…and was courted by the local dems to help them with their efforts…back when they had efforts,lol. but when obama got in, the fight was declared over(it wasnt)…i continued advocating in the paper for universal healthcare, or at least a step towards it… but then i and my MIL got invited to obama’s secong inauguration party, at the hilltop manse of a local rich guy(we were the 2 token po folks).waterfall in the foyer, gigantic picture window overlooking the barrio where i then lived, easily ignored if one simply refrained from looking down. and we sat around with the beautiful people, all of them well off and educated, and talked about who had went where to campaign for O…ohio, several other “battleground states”…fine wine, finer scotch, and even a few keystones for us rabble representatives. the talking stick, as it were, finally…and reluctantly…came to me…”joe, what do you think?” and i went to the big window, pointed to my barrio, and said, “i think we need to get the hell off this hill, get down there to the barrio with cabrito and a few kegs of beer, and register people to vote”….utter silence…shoegazing…shuffling of feet…a tiny almost choke on a half swallowed nip of scotch…and then they moved on, as if nothing had been said to upset their reverie…and then it was time to watch Obama speak on the gigantic tv thing…and MIL and i left. i was never called again…my emails were never answered again…the phone was never picked up. i put in the next paper a call for dems to meet me at the cop shop to become deputy voter registrars…and a friend, apolitical, showed up…merely to support me. i registered one person, and gave up on politics. that’s who the democrats are, now…and who they will remain, until the spell is broken, and the current regime crashes and burns utterly. i came down from the hills for Bernie in 2016, but not with the demparty…as an independent force. and went right back to the hills when the dems stole it from him. thats the perspective i’ve watched all this from, ever since. again, Fie! demparty cannot be saved, because they’ve poisoned it since at least clintontimes. they embody covert narcissism, it turns out…something of which i have become an expert, due to my mother(boomer dem wannabe pmc with all the pretensions and assumed superiority we see evidenced on msnbc at any given time). let them go into the wilds with all our sins at long last, and wither away. that is th only way to “reform” them. let them become dust. yes very good and accurate account, this is how it works as soon as PMC-types and educated folks are involved and PR is part of the game – not just politics but any area > i agree. the ballot measures tell a much larger tale than we’ve heard, so far. 100%. Missouri is a fine example. Damion Searls and the philosophy of translation. I have translated from French and Italian into English, from poetry, prose, and theatrical pieces. For some time, I was a member of an association of literary translators. Whenever translators starting talking about translation, they go on endlessly, as if they have to justify the idea of translation — as if translators and interpreters haven’t been around for thousands of years. Translation “theory” is even more deadly boring, although not quite as untethered to reality as queer theory and gender theory. Searls: “As writers go, a translator operates under an especially strong constraint: to produce a text that’s a translation of the original, not some random new thing.” This is “theory”? A long time ago, I read somewhere, or figured out the kernel of the problem myself — a translation of a work of art in the original language has to be a work of art in the target language. This has meant that some drafts of poems that I was trying to translate are still drafts — I can’t seem to get them into English. An Italian poet, whose work I was working on (some of which are those drafts in limbo), himself a noted translator of Proust into Italian, told me that at a certain point in translating, one must just give up. A translation can be beautiful, but usually, it is mainly adequate. This is why I love Moncrieff’s Proust translation. It’s a work of art in and of itself, the language inspired in ways that transcend merely paraphrasing those dense volumes into English (from a rather error ridden French edition, to be sure; Kilmartin did wonderful work availing himself of the corrected later editions to revise the Moncrieff translation). Yes! Big question is will this art survive pattern-based AI translations? Will people understand, see the difference? A.I. has no consciousness which is why prose translation doesn´t work yet. But when data is huge and calculating power enhances eventually you will get a translation of a novel that – and this is the very point – merely resembles the original more or less. (But who cares?) Is it possible the industry actually destroys the art of translation? And this is a very serious cultural issue if these moneyed interests are not checked in time with full force. >>>The Security Gap: Less Secure Group Swing Right IMO, yet again another patronizing take from the journalism class—and “white savior”-adjacent to boot. How about this take: people who don’t push electrons for a living, and people who spend more of their after-tax income on non-discretionary things, moved right. And your take is different from the tweet how? chris christie says trump to deschedule mary jane. https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/24/11/41910180/exclusive-chris-christie-says-trump-will-remove-federal-restrictions-on-marijuana-find-sweet-spot-for-crypto-regulation i mean, its that guy, and all…err those guys,lol…but if it happens, it sure as heck wasnt on my bingo card. Iowa Governor Harold Hughes was a reformed alcoholic who legalized liquor-by-the-drink in Iowa by enforcing existing laws which were widely disregarded. In no time at all the legislature passed liquor-by-the-drink and state liquor stores lost their monopolies but it did take decades to get ‘strong’ beer into Iowa. All accomplished by a 12-stepper (not a dry drunk, btw) who modernized Iowa liquor laws simply by enforcing them. Teetotaler Trump is exactly the POTUS I’d expect to normalize drug relations. Very glad he’s not doing this Harold Hughes style which would be to restart the war on drugs in the most disruptive and annoying manner possible to force Congress to take action. This will mark 12 steps, er years of having a non-drinker as President, and I’m ready for round 2 of teetotalitarian leader, barkeep please pour me a glass of Malbec and keep ’em coming when you see them nearing empty or me getting tipsy. Now having a toketolerant leader, I did not see that coming~ When Hughes was elected governor for the first time in 1962, the legislative session didn’t begin until mid-year. Hughes deputized the state police and made them shut down the “key clubs”, which were a loophole in the law. By the time the legislature convened, they were all jonesing for a drink and passed the reform quickly. Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “the best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly”. He was correct, of course, but the strategy wouldn’t work in this case. ::musical interlude:: (via YouTube) :) I doubt that Trump will deschedule mary jane. There is way too much money at stake in keeping it scheduled. As Putin has said, presidents get elected and some have ideas, but then the men in dark suits carrying briefcases show up and suddenly the president has a change of heart. Haven’t we seen this play out over and over again? Here is an item from whitepeopletwitter noting that Trump’s pick for SecState, Marco Rubio, has said he would NOT call for a Gaza Ceasefire. It is titled ” Congratulations Dipsh!ts”. Here is the link. https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1gplwwb/congratulations_dipshits/ But there are always tradeoffs in life, and maybe this is an acceptable price to pay for imposing peace on Ukraine. And to those who say it is not, I can only say ” Don’t blame me, I voted for Harris.” Actual quote from Trump today, after nominating Mike Huckabee to be the new ambassador to Israel: Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!” That’s the exact same language that Joe used when referencing his team (Blinken, Burns.) Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Excuse me while I now go pet an emotional support animal. And do not blame me, I voted for Jill Stein. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-nominates-mike-huckabee-us-ambassador-israel?msockid=2d204d3eb7166bef256e59a3b6406ab1 A guinea pig would be most appropriate for an emotional support animal… Gawd, when I first read that about Huckabee, I thought it must be from The Onion. Reality is getting worse by the moment. It’s going to take more than an emotional support animal to get through this. And don’t blame me, l didn’t vote for Trump. Charles Krauthammer coined the phrase “Oval Office OJ.” That was a bit of a hyperbolic reference to Bill Clinton after he got caught with that woman. But it rings true here. Neither party is interested in peace, or stopping the killing, just pretending like they didn’t commit the crime. Or in our case act as an accessory to murder. Best of wishes. The Lou Reed song comes to mind: Busload of faith to get by I like the “emotional support aminal” that Big Gretch fed in that infamous Pet Care video. It gets better. Trump seems to have just nominated a Fox newscaster, Pete Hegseth, for defense secretary. I was hoping for Tulsi. Not a good sign. I googled Pete Hegseth, and he is a serious war crime enthusiast. Makes Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men look like a shrinking violet. Methinks we are going to get our war-mongering straight up, not on the rocks. To modify your meme a bit, the Ship of State is now steering right for the rocks. What is funny about this is that Trump may well subconsciously be playing the part of America’s Nemesis. “You’ve been causing trouble for me for the last eight years. Now I’m going to show you what real trouble looks like.” Fellow Chris, I have no doubt Mr. Huckabee is capable of supporting that goal. Graveyards are quite peaceful. No children laughing. No people arguing. No traffic noise. No messy moral conflicts. No ethical concerns. No claims of “just war”. No hostages. Just peaceful dirt blowing through empty ruins filled with the dead. Mostly women and children. It will be peace the likes of which the world hasn’t known for millenia. I hope the stifling quiet drives whoever lives there completely mad. Gaza has the bones of a real supernatural horror story. The lurking shadows at the end of the hall in the sparkling new beachside condo in Gaza. The faintly heard cries of playing children out on the beach in the middle of the night during the full moon. But when you go out to look, nothing is there. Then you stub your toe on a half-buried child’s baby doll. But the beach commission is supposed to have cleaned up the beaches already! What’s that? It gleams dully in the moonlight. You go closer and see a land mine freshly washed up by the tide. You turn to go back and find yourself surrounded by mines. How did this happen? The condo by the sea idea is slowly but surely losing its allure. Suddenly you see a pattern in the mines laying around you. They are in a hopscotch pattern! Did some children put them there? What children? This is an Elder Condo, no children allowed except to visit. Something is wrong. Ets. etc. Stay safe. Watch where you step. I did not vote for Harris or Trump because their support for Israel is support for genocide. You passed the test, congratulations! Me three. I cannot imagine how Trump can bring peace to the Middle East but it is theoretically possible. I could envision no path to peace with Team Harris (or Biden). From my reading I have gathered that the road to peace in the Middle East goes through the grave. And to underline the point, it’s not clear that we’re getting peace in Ukraine out of this either. https://reason.com/2024/11/12/trumps-reported-national-security-advisor-supports-bombing-russia-and-afghanistan/ Poor guy thinks that it is still the 1990s. Boy, isn’t he in for a surprise. Most of those countries on his hate list can now shoot back. As I understand it, by the time Trump is in office most of NATO’s member countries will be in violation of the 2% of GDP rule agreed upon in the Wales Summit Declaration (NATO) (Article 14) in 2014. Here (also NATO) is a handy graph (#2). If my memory serves me here, Trump makes a lot of noise about member countries being deadbeats. There will be meat on that bone this time around. I see a lot of gloating going on among Democrats and others about Trump’s neocon picks. (No, I don’t see too much of it here because I think people here are much better informed.) What I do have to say is I have always been very impressed with how responsive the Republican party is to it’s voters – it’s much more responsive than the Democrats who routinely $hit on their supporters, and Trump’s supporters did get Pompeo removed. That is an achievement. Trump responds to public pressure! I mean we’re talking about war here. And we don’t want war. So how about we support them in their efforts? How about instead of don’t blame me we say I don’t want war, what can I do? I mean I didn’t vote for the guy, but I certainly want what’s best for my country, and we are where we are. I get a kick out of the bookends on the ap votecast bar chart Well OK, let me re-phrase this in a way that could motivate more voters… Tired of how the Democrats blow you off? Tired of having a rich ex-President lecture you on how to vote? Pile in on that X effort to convince Trump to dump the neocons. Attach a video about how you are working with your fellow citizens to help shape Trump’s Presidency because he listens to the voters, and he listens to the citizens that didn’t even vote for him. So rather than having an ex-President lecturing YOU on how to VOTE, he’s listening to US on how to run AMERICA. I mean, imagine being Clinton or Obama and watching THAT. That’s like slipping the dagger in, giving it a good twist, and snapping it off at the hilt. Rhetorically speaking of course. I have added orts and scraps. The quality of the blame cannonry and the post-election analysis is improving, which is a mercy/ LOL wrt the Spanish sugar packet! :D Grover Cleveland’s 2nd term started with a financial panic where money was really scarce, silver coins dated from 1893 to 1895 being the most valuable years of all, as few were minted. What if ‘Trump 2-the Sequel’ started similarly? “Return of the Creature From the DC Swamp?” Oh, be still my beating heart! Trump as the “Swamp Thing.” (I don’t see him as the Toxic Avenger. You know that character. The long-lost evil twin brother of the Hulk.) My Elliotician says the odds favor a massive move upward in the barbarous relic, with silver headed to test the long-term high in the 40’s. It won’t happen likely in time for Christmas, but February is a distinct possibility. Confetti money drives out the good, and once the moneyed classes figure out that their 401k is a 201k factoring in inflation, it’s Katy bar the door! I’m thinking more along the lines of something that matters to everybody, the current value of their abodes not abiding and in fact free falling, as inflation gathers steam in everything else they purchase. To coin an old phrase, a financial panic. The problem with confetti money will become apparent when and if the masses have a divine revelation, sort of like Moses when he saw the burning bush. All that funny-money being printed up is really quite worthless when you get down to it. At least a Kennedy quarter had some silver in it. Tricky Dick really fooled us good in 1971, and here we are almost 54 years later still swallowing the trickwitchery. We’re a ways away from that, but maybe all the reckless talk of tax cuts, guns, and butter will do the trick. I need boundless and unfettered fiat money to keep going for at least another couple decades, as its all I know, as well as pretty much all of my fellow citizenry. It’d be tantamount to removing all the lane dividers on the 405 @ rush hour were the fiat lady to sing, kinda bad. What possible financial wrecks have we cataloged for 2025 on NC so far? Last I checked it looked like we were going to have: (1) a collapse in home prices, (2) a complete collapse of the commercial real estate market, (3) market contagion from any banks exposed to either of those via MBS or CMBS, (4) shenanigans from inflation revving back up with the rate cuts, (5) possible supply side shocks from China restricting key inputs, (6) further labor issues from strikes, (7) possible price shocks from tarrifs being put in place prior to industrial policy, (8) huge swings in public sector workforce due to St. Musk pulling a Twitter on the federal government employee population, (9) labor related issues from possible mass deportation or the implied threat of mass deportation, (10) increasing risk of HPAI breakout in US. Oh, and, (11) weird weather causing grid failures this winter. Let me know if I’m forgetting anything. The Aliens are wondering why the Terries won’t eat the terryfood any more. 1.) not likely 2.)bailout 3.)see 2 4.)who cares, my inflation is wall streets payday 5.)what’s the difference between sanctions and tariffs 6.) who cares 7.) see 5 8.) see 6 9.) the beatings will continue until morale improves, plus 6 and 8 10.)unforeseen calamity for the win 11.) bonus points but both 10 and 11 allow cover for more fiscal stimulus to the corpulents Beyond hope and fear is a zen state, or something, stock up on water and canned goods I guess. As a release I recommend finding a med industry mba and be short tempered and mean and when they ponder the dire state of the dem party suggest firmly that the fact that 9 out of 10 med industry mba’s are dems is the problem. apologies to yves for being too broad, let’s say nine out of ten pharma industry mba’s and their private equity brethren instead… Why can’t Democrats just accept Harris was a shitty candidate? In 2019, Sanders was so good I switched voter registration from Republican to Democrat just to be able to cast my vote for him when the circus rolled into town. Unfortunately, when it did, the smoke filled room had already anointed Biden in SC. So amidst a pandemic, I presented myself in person and cast my vote for Sanders anyway. Come November I vote for DJT for the same reason I voted for him in 2016, Joe Biden was the same corrupt piece of crap as Hillary Clinton (saying a lot because HRC is the queen of corrupt alongside Rep Pelosi). However, had Senator Sanders been the nominee in 2020, I would have voted for him (and he would have won). Come this election, a) it probably wouldn’t have included DJT, but b) if it had I would have voted for Sanders again. I’m your basic Republican trending toward middle of the road voter. Democrats just need to run someone good. And their line up for 2028 doesn’t have anyone good in my opinion. Pritzker, Newsome, Whitmer, Butigeig, Kahana, et al? The whole lot can go to Hell. Notice I don’t even mention Harris . . . she’ll never run again, and if she’s stupid enough to try, she drops out before the first primary just like last time because she’s a shit candidate. Both of her Presidential runs set a lot of donor money on fire. No one will want to look stupid and so won’t back her again. Unfortunately hers may be the only one whose future career options took a hit. Not even her husband and brother in law will get blackballed much less the top Obama and Clinton retreads that were part of the campaign. To be fair, the Dem platform also sucked – basically it was “Joe Biden did everything perfectly.” Bernie could not have won on that platform. re Oprah-gate–Oprah says she was not personally paid a million dollars but turns out her production company was paid a million to stage one of the Harris rallies. https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/oprah-winfrey-never-paid-million-kamala-harris-campaign-1236207187/ Which doesn’t answer the question of why the mega rich Winfrey didn’t volunteer her company’s services for free as well. Tis a mystery. Company policy? Simple greed? If you are that good, charge for it? Lots of people got Oprah’s number when she had to be barred bringing in her film crew into a relief center in Maui in order to publicize herself. I have a longer comment in moderation about how none of it adds up. (And I even went for providing service at cost versus gratis.) But yeah, Winfrey has a long record of bad recommendations. I do believe that a majority of the deluded Harris supporters will get that she was a terrible candidate who had nothing to offer, and Oprah knew it but took the money anyway. May both fade into the mists of time. Who knew that Pol Ticketron is the best place to procure ‘sold-out’ acts. Who sold out? Don’t be surprised to discover a close bond between American political Parties and procurers. For example, Epstein-Bare Virus, which is, naturally, an STD. I was never particularly optimistic -shocking I know- but Trump’s appointments seem characteristically bad. Oh well. It’s gonna be a fun four years. We’ve got a collision course with Trumpflation as well if he succeeds with tariffs and deportations. Oh, it could be a mess. Trying to cut interest rates and taxes with inflation going up. How does it usually go? Prices will be going up and stats will say it’s just “vibes”. Trump is going to do a lot of things any sane person will despise: Bully Jay Powell into cutting interest rates back to zero; Nominate warmongers; Fire Lina Khan, the best public servant we’ve had in years. You cannot vote your way out of what is coming. Maybe Trump will bring it faster. I never see anybody obsessed with money doing the kind of things I like to do, which invariably cost nothing more than gas & food money, even though we can obtain a similar scale of exclusivity that Illionaires crave in living their sheltered pampered lives, but perhaps not having a price tag on my experiences lessens its allure, dramatically. Bike Snob NYC’s latest column about the rise in pedestrian deaths. Feeling Bloated https://bikesnobnyc.com/2024/11/12/feeling-bloated/ “The US Is a Civic Desert. To Survive, the Democratic Party Needs to Transform Itself.” I guess they are saying that the party should go back to the future? I mean the party had been organized and run right down to the neighborhood level up until the 1980s. And the Republicans, while never as community oriented, had also been far more organically involved at the county and city levels decades ago. Both are far more brittle than they look. not brittle where it really counts, like ballot access, media access, debate access, funding, etc. they both seem pretty strong in those areas, still….but legitimacy crises rolls and tumbles right along, under the floors, and will not be denied. ive seen allusions to…but no hard data(no time, these weeds hafta be pulled right now) the idea that overall voter turnout was down quite a bit…i expect that to continue and get much much worse, much quicker than anybody expects. i voted this time around by staying home. so did many others, mostly on the dem side. shunning the entire crooked and evil mess. Fie! It wasn’t that long ago that they went to court and showed that they were like a club that did not have to listen to their members – and they won. The Republicans would be somewhat similar. Here in Oz over thirty years ago one of the main parties had a major ‘reform.’ Up til then, local branches would choose who would stand for them in their seat and if they won, represent them in Parliament. Afterwards, that party was free to parachute all manner of people into those seats that did not live there or know the people. The other party was doing the same and was even parachuting in ‘celebrity’ candidates which never worked at all. How will community organizing work when all they have is contempt for anybody not already in the cult? Well, Howard Dean had some success trying to reinvigorate the Democratic grassroots, and the party elites couldn’t wait to throw him and all his efforts in the trash. So this is what we’ve ended up with: a rootless party with crappy candidates, supported by billionaires and celebrities, pushing militarism and foreign slaughters with an asphyxiatingly heavy dose of identity politics layered on top of that, a combination that will never appeal to a plurality of voters. And they don’t even seem to have any insight, self-awareness, or–let’s face it–brains. Just big egos and big delusions. People like Dean, Al Gore, Gary Hart, and some of the others from that era may have had bad positions on some of the issues, but you at least felt like they were intelligent and able to adapt to reality not matching their expectations. Howard Dean had some success trying to reinvigorate… Howard Dean in recent years has been a fierce neo-conservative, and severely undermined Bernie Sanders especially in concert with Neera Tanden (now of the Biden administration). Dean and Tanden worked to drive Representative Tulsi Gabbard from the Democratic Party for standing against military strikes on Syria. https://twitter.com/govhowarddean/status/850895059771957248 Howard Dean ✔@GovHowardDean This is a disgrace.

Tulsi Gabbard: “Yes, I’m skeptical” of claim Assad regime is behind chemical weapons attack 7:32 PM – 7 Apr 2017 John Ratcliffe is Trump’s nominee as Director of the CIA. Another (former) Republican Congressman, who served as Director of National Intelligence in the last year of the Trump administration. The main controversies back then were his challenges to the Russiagate narrative. I just read the Wikipedia article on Ratcliffe. It is pretty amazing, in that it still asserts a number of Russiagate claims as true that have been proven false, and vice versa. Hard to tell where this guy would fall on the “warmonger” scale. But he did give the Establishment fits on Russiagate, which is a plus in my book. Here’s his Wikipedia page. Pretty entertaining: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ratcliffe_(American_politician) thanks 4 info On the other hand what´s your problem? German legacy daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG today has a big interview about Trump up-close and personal with none other than: CHRISTOPHER FUCKING STEELE! Even without the paywall you get this magnificent picture of Putin holding baby Trump (NOT baby Yoda!): https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/trump-putin-steele-dossier-wahlbeeinflussung-lux.VHXwZ2yC2maewnZ5z54YGn?reduced=true “”Trump is a vengeful man” “Christopher Steele unwittingly rose to fame in 2017 with the dossier that investigated Donald Trump’s involvement with Russia. How does the British ex-agent now view his re-election?” Gosh this guy must be a real hero! p.s. Well, you have to grant Ratcliffe that he has no Wikispooks entry to his name, yet. Rubio does: FWIW https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Marco_Rubio I love those Ratcliffe eyebrows. They remind me of the eyebrows of a certain American president who too came from Texas. A beautiful human being. Must be a hell of a place with countless remarkable American patriotic men. BUT, one has to indeed admit, Wikipedia says Ratcliffe was providing DISINFORMATION! How cool is that. “(…) Thirty-five days before the November 2020 election, Ratcliffe declassified 2016 Russian disinformation that asserted Hillary Clinton had personally approved a scheme to associate Trump with Vladimir Putin and Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Ratcliffe provided the disinformation to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who publicly released it. The allegation had been previously rejected as baseless by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. Ratcliffe acknowledged in a letter to Graham that the intelligence community “does not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.”[82] The intelligence community opposed the release of the information.[83] According to the New York Times, Ratcliffe’s disclosure “appeared to be a bid to help Mr. Trump politically.” (…)” Yes, Wimpypedia is “entertaining”, it is not a source for truth. “Leaving and Waving” Saw something similar with this English couple. They took a picture of themselves in their backyard with their house behind them. Did it every year like clockwork but then one year there was only the husband and a few years later, nobody. But the saddest photo of that ‘Leaving and Waving’ series was the last one where it was just the house. For the person taking that photo, it would have been probably a good bye to the house they grew up with with their parents and all the memories. i couldnt bring myself to look at all that…still too near, 2 1/2 years later. “her absence is like the sky, spread over everything” -C.S. Lewis Yes. That is a wonderful book about loss. Lewis was a versatile writer. (He went through the same loss himself.) I have something similar. Every year before traveling home from our Christmas gathering, we took a few pictures of my family and my parents. Nothing planned, it just turned out we were in roughly the same spot. The kids (and some times the adults) grumbled, but we got a few pictures every year, missing a handful of years because weather kept us apart. 2023, both parents passed. This year the house was sold so the tradition ends… but we have +20 years. From youngsters to college age. Maybe I will put them in an album. Makes me appreciate my wife’s perseverance in this task despite the rest of us moaning about it. I try and tell our children that with each passing, a bit of up close and personal history disappears. Try and preserve as much as you can. Alas, they are still too young (40s) to understand. Bloomborg price is a riot, so his survey was given to like 5 squillionaires vs 30000 normal people and that’s “science” These sociologists… But obviously happiness still increases after 75k a year…unless that’s 75k in interest! If you are a millionaire , would you answer you are unhappy with your life ?. Bloomberg/WSJ study will says more money more happiness. Minimalist magazine would says the opposite. These studies are not worth the piece of paper they are written on These sociologists are writing what they are paid to, in order to increase their own personal happines. Their end goal is probably to get on depicted Vessel of happiness and sail directly to the Epstein Island, where The ‘Happiness Plateau’ Doesn’t Exist. Yep. I spent a lot of my academic career pointing out what mathematical properties “happiness scores” must possess in order to make all these statements like “this group does better by achieving x” or “this country is happier”. Basically if you state “4” then you must have twice as must utility as when you state “2”….difference between 6 and 4 must be same as between 3 and 1….and then this must hold ACROSS people. RATIO scales. Otherwise you can’t do mathematical operators. There is not a single study in world history that confirms this. It is “not even wrong”. Plus there are a multitude of studies showing that happiness or life satisfaction scores for retired people are absolutely inconsistent with younger people. I won’t bore people again but they are out there in plain sight. NC even in links showcased a study within the last year suggesting that young people had changed their internal reference scale to give happiness scores. If you see a rating scale then you are probably safe to assume it is garbage. If you want justification, e-mail the authors to ask “do your rating scale numbers satisfy ratio scale properties, as accepted by neuro-scientists?” Betcha they won’t reply. I won’t even start on the “quirks” people have re certain numbers…..I have a NSFW posting about what traditional Chinese people do with certain numbers. It involves soft and hard. Go figure. Tkacik, “and the proliferating subsistence entrepreneur class”. There, they’ve done it, the Democrats have re-created the “peasant” or “serf”, now neoliberally ennobled! I’ve had recent experience with “subsistence entrepreneurs”. The ones I know are excellent people, and I mean that, they are genuinely good, well intentioned people, mostly female immigrants who’s small scale and very publicly spirited enterprises live off grants from various Democrat controlled State development and re-development agencies. Shall we refer to the bureaucrats with sinecures in these agencies as “the entitled tax farmers”? At least at the state D level in New York, it is the political distribution of tax receipts through these “entitled tax farmers” that commands the fealty of the “subsistence entrepreneur class”. I suppose they were supposed to be the future of the Democrat party, but their significant others voted differently (that “it’s okay to lie to your spouse” thing appears to have backfired). It is kind of shocking how incompetent the Democrat party is, that they’ve been pursuing Trump for 8 endless years now. And completely failed. Totally. The full weight of the Establishment media, national security state, judicial system, and he evaded them all. They’ve failed so completely even the putative resistance hasn’t materialized this time. Wowzers. Functionally inept bankrupt party. That stands for nothing but gifting. How’d that billion dollars work out for you? On the other hand. As a rearguard action against the left, a success again. So the Democrat party is doing it’s job. And moving Overton Window to the far right. yes to this, thanks… The reason why there could be no primary is to not allow real issues to surface, and kamala had strict instructions to not give an inch…tax credits?

Further, for all its many faults, Elon Musk’s hell-site still has a very functional Covid-conscious community, which these trolls would end up splitting, not that such a thing would matter to them. Brunch at Blue Sky! – Lambert above. From my travels I see a large effort to move from X to Blue Sky. Embubblement is right. Can’t deal with anything outside of that. Not that I’m defending X. They hate Trump, Musk, Putin – the axis of evil. Only to get more wild with the latest news. Trump taps Musk to lead a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ with Ramaswamy From NPR. Can be found all over. More hair catching on fire. The dream of drowning government in a bathtub really is at hand. Thanks Obama! > Trump taps Musk to lead a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ with Ramaswamy I think Warren’s snark doesn’t quite hit the mark: The Office of Government Efficiency is off to a great start with split leadership: two people to do the work of one person. Yeah, this seems REALLY efficient. https://t.co/XXKvrUAPkE — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 13, 2024 It’s not a matter of efficiency; it’s a matter of “What kind of chain of command is this?” (To be fair, there were two Roman Consuls). Further, if you think government should be run like a business (it shouldn’t be) Musk did succeed in massively reducing headcount at Twitter while that very large platform continued to perform. So, efficiency. But since Musk never did figure out how to run a paint booth (heck, QA) at Tesla, I would attribute that more to Silicon Valley bloat than anything else (and other Silicon Valley moguls followed his lead). It would be the same at Boeing: Massive headcount reductions would hit people with wrenches pretty fast. So is government more like Twitter (massive bloat) or Boeing (muscle close to the skin)? My instinct, as a quondam liberal, is to say the latter, but today I am either more cynical or realistic. NOAA muscle and DOE fat* would be my guess; CDC/NIH almost entirely fat at the administrative level, muscle at the science level. USDA I bet is fat all the way down to the inspectors. Social Security is all muscle. And so forth. Whether Musk/Ramaswamy will swing the axe out of ideology or actual merit remains to be seen. Oh, and Trump pairing Ramaswamy with Musk is an enormous mark of favor. Man, some of those Swedes really need take take a chill pill. So a Russian Orthodox Church was built on the outskirts of the Swedish town of Västerås.

For me the killer quote line from the article was the following: But the highest-profile victims of the purge were cautious, pragmatic people trying too hard to appease a capricious and bottomlessly vengeful boss class It reminded me so much of the TV series “Snowpiercer”. The Mr. Wilford character in that series is the boss of all that’s left of humanity remaining on a train making revolutions around the globe. You want to be in the good graces of Mr. Wilford lest ye not be chosen to stay on the train. Not only stay in the good graces but demonstrate your value/worth. Not all that different than needing to stay in the good graces of and prove your value to the boss at work lest ye lose your job. Getting back to the article, Trump is of the “boss class”; Trump doesn’t need to stay in the good graces of anybody. Kamala has the disadvantage of obviously not being of the “boss class” or at least not the same “boss class”. That said, Kamala had options. One option was to portray herself as a member of the “boss class” that has claimed virtuous authority – the authority at war with deplorables and irredeemables. Another option was to portray herself as a member of the “boss class” that comes from exercizing governmental authority. Biden could have done Kamala a solid if he had just resigned mid term and let Kamala have the reins. Or Kamala could have embraced “servant class” membership as a servant of the people. Instead we got Kamala as member of the “servant class” to the “boss class”, as per the article a member in good standing and making sure to stay in good standing by being obedient. Which any intuitive voter could sniff out. Anyways, highly recommend “Snowpiercer”. I think the readers here would find it right up their alley as a study in particular of the “boss class” and fascism and democracy and where does power come from. But at the end of the day it’s just good story telling and a rollicking one at that (pun intended). Sean Bean does a wonderful job playing the Mr. Wilford character as if his Ned Stark character in Game of Thrones had gone-to-the-“survival of the fittest”-side, a charismatic of the “boss class”. He’s not the only charismatic, not the only fascist in the story, but unlike the others embraces it. Plenty of parallels to personalities in the US. I’ve had contacts who are highly observant but not in academia intuit and observe the sort of behavior you highlighted in the Moe Tkacik quote at the top. I can’t exactly replicate some of the colorful phrase-making, but “Revenge of HR ladies” comes close. And that particular rendering comes from a woman, a pretty high profile and top professional in her field, who finds herself somewhat hostage to that type at her company, and regularly and loudly say that allowing women into leadership roles was a mistake. I do not buy that conclusion at all, but I think there is a case to be made that women were given important posts far out of proportion to the ones who had the skills and temperament to be very good at it. > making sure to stay in good standing by being obedient PMC through and through. My (executive) late mother’s advice was ‘go along to get along.’ Some of us bristle at that. I became day-job self-employed. Trump builds out national security team with picks of Hegseth for Pentagon, Noem for DHS AP Fresh faces… Entertainingly, one of the largest Covid outbreaks in the US came at a meatpacking plant in South Dakota on Noem’s watch, good job. Much is being made of Hegseth’s stint at Gitmo, but then if Obama had shut Gitmo down, as he promised…. Anyhow, Hegseth went to Princeton and then got a masters Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, so presumably he meets at least some sort of baseline, the same as the other usual suspects. Anyhow, giving new meaning to the phrase “political appointees,” they not being appointed for their expertise. Presumably if the civil service beneath them retains some functionality, that will help them. “Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard”? Oh no… p.s. John Krasinski “Sexiest Man Alive”! How much did he pay them? His goofy face is what you usually get when you want a stereotype for your modern-day understanding father figure in a Pixar movie about a precocious girl that intends to fly to Mars and who has “mother-issues”. Did I forget ticking a box? Gosh, I miss those days when watching a Disney movie you could sense the abuse all over the story… re: CHINA US EU German BERLINER ZEITUNG, Engl.

Re: Proposals to reform the Democratic Party: ” Maps. There should be an accountable Democratic captain for every neighborhood in the country.” We moved to a suburb of Denver in 2007 and I became immersed in Colorado politics, including dedicating a large part of my life to Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008. I received a call from a local political activist and party official (I thought), asking me to be a precinct captain. There was, apparently, an existing precinct captain, who was an employee in the pro-abortion lobbying group then known as NARAL, but her existence was hand-waved out of mind. So, I got my list, knocked on doors, talked to people, tried to get to know ‘my’ precinct and do some organizing. After the election, I talked with local party officials about getting precinct meetings going, in preparation for the next elections. I was informed that I was not really the ‘official’ precinct captain, that my name had never been submitted to party leadership, and thus never ratified. So, I was, politely, being told to ‘bug off.’ I tried again prior to the next presidential election, at a breakfast meeting with local and county Dem officials. I talked with the Dem county head about the importance of having precinct captains working at grass roots level, knowing their constituency, organizing precinct meetings, gathering ideas and information and having that flow upwards. Hah! I was met with a blank stare and told in no uncertain terms, that the ideas and information and direction would come from the top. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Something Deeper Than Control Is Driving Restrictive Work Mandates
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindsaykohler/2024/11/12/something-deeper-than-control-is-driving-restrictive-work-mandates/
Time Published: 2024-11-12T15:49:49Z
Full Content:
white color theme modern style office with exposed concrete floor and a lot of plant, 3d rendering Despite overwhelming research that shorter work weeks and remote working are good for productivity, there is still a debate between employees and employers on where and how they work. Spotify made headlines recently for reaffirming its work-from-anywhere policy, proclaiming that "our employees aren't children." So, why do we still have so many return-to-office (RTO) advocates, such as Amazon? "It's a power play between the employer and the employee about return to office mandates or shorter working weeks. And I think a lot of it is coming down to a sense of control," says Dr. Dale Whelehan, a behavioral scientist and CEO at 4 Day Week Global. While many have surmised that control is the real reason leaders are stubborn to change outdated working models, Whelehan's comment tunes into a more interesting undercurrent: the shifting dynamic between employee and employer. It is indeed a power play; a power play with two dramatic elements beyond control: trust and loyalty. "It's a challenging economic climate, and companies' default is to assume that the worker is the one that's the problem. Therefore, they want to bring the worker back in and monitor and evaluate their outcomes to try and improve productivity through that manner," Whelehan says. The problem with that is that all the research — too numerous to cite here — points to these restrictive mandates having the exact opposite effect. "All of these policies to revoke flexibility and autonomy is going to perpetuate further burnout." Businesses aren't following the data — they're following their gut instinct instead. But what worked 20 years ago won't work today. Why? Because trust is broken. Whelehan makes the point that back in the day, workers were happy to come in five days a week in exchange for stability. They knew if they were loyal, they could have a job for life if they wanted. Now, employees see regular stories of mass layoffs and realize that the majority of businesses are going to put profit before people. No longer is a track record of good performance enough for job security. So, in exchange for that lack of stability, employees want more flexibility. "It's a world of survival where people are constantly trading off money versus time," he says. Why is flexible working linked to better business performance? It’s simple — burnout. "Burnout has risen exponentially. We can't deny that people are reporting higher levels of stress, full stop." Whelehan links that stress to the fact that our current working model hasn't been updated for modern gender dynamics and economic realities. "It's no longer just the man going to work and coming home and having his meal prepared for him by his wife. That system worked before, but that's not the lived existence of the workforce now. It is now a dual-income household who is expected to work above and beyond, who has to pay for childcare, and is expected to commute longer distances to their workplaces because they can no longer afford to live in urban areas," he says. Managers and companies must evolve beyond outdated mindsets to remain competitive. "I think management is stuck in this paradigm of thinking from a hundred years ago that is not married to the skills that we're trying to actually develop within the workforce," says Whelehan. "And it's because we're fundamentally misfiring on the management side." 4 Day Week Global helps organizations trial the right flexible working model for the context in which they operate. One of the key activities to make the pilot successful beyond its fixed term is gathering the right before and after data, such as turnover, revenue, productivity, and self-reported measures of well-being. It's showing examples of where it's worked in a company/region similar to your own to build that social proof. Whelehan advises that it is the socialization of the successes that create a groundswell of motivation to try a new philosophy of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Streaming Video Prices Rise While Quality Falls, Following Cable TV’s Lead
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/12/streaming-video-prices-rise-while-quality-falls-following-cable-tvs-lead/
Time Published: 2024-11-12T13:23:02Z

Culture Streaming video still provides some meaningful advantages to traditional cable: it’s generally cheaper (assuming you don’t sign up for every service under the sun); customer satisfaction ratings are generally higher; and users have more power to pick and choose and cancel services at a whim. But the party simply isn’t poised to last. Thanks to industry consolidation and saturated market growth, streaming giants have started behaving much like the traditional cable giants they once disrupted. As with most industries suffering from “enshittification,” that generally means steadily worse service at higher prices to appease Wall Street’s demand for improved quarterly returns at any cost (even long term company health). As a result, Netflix has started acting like password sharing, something it advocated for for years, is a dire cardinal sin. Amazon now thinks would be fun to increase the number of ads it runs, charging Amazon Prime users even more money to avoid them. Consumers are paying more for streaming than ever as layoffs abound, streaming catalogs shrink, and the underlying product quality gets worse. Ars Technica points to a recent flood of surveys from TiVO, CableTV.com, and Whip Media that all show that streaming customers continue to report a drop in the quality and customer satisfaction of streaming services over the last few years. When asked why this is happening, TiVo analysts suggest the problem is simply that companies are struggling to make streaming profitable: “The amount of new original content overall on SVODs may be down [year over year] as many streamers continue to struggle to hit profitability targets. Without new original content (or exclusive content deals), perceptions of value/differentiation may decline.” You’ll notice that neither the trend-studying organizations nor Ars discuss several important things. One, the pay for fail-upward media sector executives (like Time Warner CEO David Zaslav) continues to skyrocket despite both strategic missteps and quality problems. Two, that mindless consolidation and a “growth for growth’s sake” merger mania mindset is only accelerating all these problems. Or three, that this is all driven by Wall Street’s insatiable need for improved short-term quarterly improvements at any cost, regardless if that ultimately harms consumers, workers, or the product itself. It’s simply not good enough to provide an affordable product people really like; the need for improved quarterly returns at impossible, permanent scale inevitably results in a sort of product cannibalization and destructive performance art (see: the AT&T Time Warner Discovery mergers) that’s not really subtle. Companies can mitigate this erosion if they’re in sectors where there’s still subscriber growth to be had or if they’re able to expand into additional business opportunities. But streaming subscriber growth has hit a wall, and there’s nowhere else to really go if your product is quality film and television. So instead we get more creative ways to be annoying and nickel-and-dime customers for ever-sagging product quality. This results in an enshittification cycle that absolutely will drive more users to either free services (Twitch, TikTok, YouTube) or piracy, at which point streaming executives will blame everything (younger generations! VPNs!) but their own choices. It’s exactly what cable TV executives did. And many of those folks now work in streaming, having been financially incentivized every step of the way to have learned nothing from the experience. Filed Under: competition, consumers, enshittification, prices, streaming, tv, video Companies: disney, netflix, warner bros. discovery YouTube also get big price raises for their premium plans (like their Premium Family just recently). There has been a lot of investments in streaming services and still not much has been collected, and since the user engagement is, at best, stalling, the only solution is to continue to milk the poor skinny cash cows that are subscribers. And since producing good content will always cost more and more (new technology allow reducing some production cost, but not marketing), and that nobody is eager to invest no more, video streaming is doom to become like music streaming: not a revolution but another way to get content. So yes, I’m still buying my CDs like a 80s dinosaur, and yes, I am paying more and more to listen to them. Calling an early shot that at least one Democratic Primary contender in 2028 will put streaming costs and ad runs in their stump speech, correctly (if belatedly) throwing blame on the Trump irregulation policy. (This makes one massive assumption, but we’re all entitled to a bit of optimism to start our weeks) The same party that as soon as it took office after correctly calling The Patriot Act a direct assault on the 4th Amendment decided it was a great idea and didn’t go far enough? https://newrepublic.com/article/155793/hell-democrats-just-extend-patriot-act The same party that first called the idea of building more walls on the southern border stupid, but then built more? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/biden-administration-waives-federal-laws-allow-border-wall-constructio-rcna118959 That party? You really have learned absolutely nothing from the shellacking the outspoken fascists just gave you. “The Democrats will make things somewhat better, but they’ll still be bad, so let’s make things worse!” Fuck me. The American left is dumber than dog shit. yup, people are dumb – film at eleven. Thing is, most people are neither right nor left. If you were smart you would know this. What is Right and what is Left? Define them in your glorious detail. Now try to fit the entire population into your two little cubby holes. Square peg, round hole, better get a bigger hammer for this one. After November 5th, I’m somewhat more inclined to agree. That the American left wasted a brat-branded opportunity, boycotted the vote over the Israeli-Gaza war, and twice handed the White House over to a power-mad, vindictive, rambling waste of space isn’t just ridiculous, it’s embarrassing. boycotted the vote over the Israeli-Gaza war for what its worth there is zero evidence that israel/gaza/genocide played any roll here. just because some people made it their main cause doesn’t mean that american voters did. Regarding the border wall issue…. “Congress appropriated fiscal year 2019 funds for the construction of border barrier in the Rio Grande Valley, and DHS is required to use those funds for their appropriated purpose,” the CBP spokesperson said… So, what was it you proposed that Biden do about money congress allocated during Trump’s term? They don’t dislike the idea of a king. They just want a different type of king. The Emperor has no clothes. They’re going to have to. I’m starting to think the next Democrat should run on eliminating taxes on eggs and literally nothing else. 45 million American adults are functionally illiterate. Tell them you will put a tariff on avocado toast. I don’t mind the inflation as much as I minded my cable fees promoting Fox News Reading this latest TD piece made me think about Walter Kirn on Oprah’s $1 million fee for the Kamala interview: ‘You would have thought Oprah would have gotten to the point in her life where she would have stopped Hitler for free, being a billionaire and everything.’ Matt Taibbi: ‘[Laughing] It is funny that you need to charge to stop Hitler.’ xD How is it, the way you become a billionaire? Does it require certain traits? Perhaps an unwillingness to throw money at causes (unless there’s a tax break somewhere, in which case you’re effectively throwing the government’s money)? I would think that stopping literal Nazism was worth any cost to the individual or society! “on Oprah’s $1 million fee” You mean the thing that did not happen, but was being spread by a bunch of idiot right wingers? https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/oprah-winfrey-rumors-kamala-harris-campaign-one-million-1236060133/ There’s a further link to inadequate antitrust enforcement here: A quality product that is not taking advantage of opportunities to increase its quarterly profit is an attractive acquisition target i.e., Either you are the predator, or you are the prey. the need for improved quarterly returns at impossible, permanent scale inevitably results in a sort of product cannibalization and destructive performance art (see: the AT&T Time Warner Discovery mergers) that’s not really subtle.

Title: I was laid off from Amazon, rejoined, and quit less than 3 months later. I should've seen the writing on the wall.

I should've seen the writing on the wall — the company has changed. I'd rather have no job than work for a company I no longer respect. When I first joined Amazon in 2017, I felt very fortunate to work there. As a program manager working with the company's middle and last-mile operations teams, I had a great boss who knew Amazon's culture inside and out. I loved how our senior leaders valued evidence and logic over status; if you had the data, no matter your level, people listened. I loved that we spoke in the language of Amazon's leadership principles in the hallways and in meetings. "I really loved your Bias for Action there," a colleague would say, referring to the value placed on speed. I could see myself continuing to "work hard, have fun, make history" at Amazon for years to come. But in January 2023, in the middle of a personal health scare, I was one of the 18,000 employees laid off. Scared and angry, I took a 12-week severance and a small health insurance stipend. I'd dreamt for years about taking a career break but didn't feel financially secure, so I began doing part-time instructional design work as a sole proprietor while I figured out what was next. A year later, I got the opportunity to return to Amazon as a boomerang employee. I took it, but I quickly realized that the innovative, exciting work environment I remembered was gone, replaced by what I felt was ineffective leadership and a disproportionate focus on share prices. Eleven weeks after rejoining, I resigned. Here are the four red flags that told me Amazon's culture had changed. In January 2024, a former colleague reached out to me about a role that would be opening up on his team. Despite my poor layoff experience, I was enticed by the idea of rejoining Amazon and began looking for other roles on LinkedIn. I made it to the final-round interview loop for a senior product manager role. Four of the five interviews felt familiar, but my interview with the "bar raiser" — an Amazon employee specifically trained in interview skills to advise the hiring team on how to raise the bar with each new hire — felt different. At the end of the interview, I asked her how things had changed after the layoffs. She responded, knowing that I had been laid off, that the layoffs were a positive challenge for her team as they had to do more with less. Her response was a punch in the gut. So layoffs were a good thing? I'd always been told that a value at Amazon was to treat "the candidate as a customer," but didn't experience that. About a week later the recruiter shared that the team felt I would make a stronger program manager than product manager and asked me to do another interview loop for that role. I declined and told the recruiter that a second full round of interviews was duplicative and unnecessary. I ended up being offered the role and declined it because of my sour interview process. Looking back, I should have seen my interview experience as a sign of how Amazon had changed. A few weeks later, in May 2024, I accepted a different offer from Amazon for a Nashville-based role on another team I'd applied for. I was living in Atlanta and moved to Nashville to adhere to the 3-day-a-week in-office policy. Relocating was a big decision, but I felt excited to rejoin the Amazon I knew and loved, despite the interview process hiccup. Even before my first day of the new job, I saw another example of how Amazon's culture had changed: uneven implementation of return-to-office policies. I couldn't pick up my computer at the office; instead, I had to get it shipped to a non-office address. There were no assigned desks, only "agile seating." Each day I was in the office, I had to find an open desk on my assigned floor and if I wanted to store stuff at work, I had to get a locker. My onboarding that first week was entirely virtual, and I never saw any of my teammates in the office, as they all worked in different cities. And there was a two-year waitlist to get parking at my office building — my recruiter called it a "parking hellscape." It made me question: Why did I relocate my life for an in-person office experience that didn't exist? I joined the newly created content team, which my boss had taken over nine months prior. In my third week, my boss mentioned that another person on another team might take on the content strategy work he'd hired me for. In my fourth week, I was invited to a last-minute meeting, which felt ominously similar to my layoff call one year prior, and was told that the whole content team was being dissolved. I was told that my group's leadership team had been considering this move since Q4 of 2023. Despite knowing about the team's likely demise, my boss still hired four people in the two months leading up to the team being disbanded. In my previous six years at Amazon, I had never encountered these sorts of pivots. It seemed like Amazon's burgeoning bureaucracy had created an environment of no accountability. The Amazon I joined in 2016 prided itself in being "peculiar." Instead of making PowerPoint presentations, we prepared for monthly business reviews by writing six-page narratives designed to help us make data-driven decisions. Each meeting started with everyone, including directors and VPs, reading those documents for 15 to 30 minutes before starting a line-by-line discussion. When I rejoined this year, I found that people were still writing six-pagers, but they didn't seem to understand the purpose anymore. The documents didn't have the polish or data to allow in-depth discussion of the facts. Instead, the conversation would veer to topics the leaders were interested in. It seemed documents, and all the effort behind them, had become the epitome of make-work rather than a unique way to produce essential decision-making tools. A few weeks after my team was dissolved, I met with my new team leader and teammates to map out our work. I realized I saw very little of what I'd signed on to do. My layoff should've been the writing on the wall — this place has changed — but I clung to the idea of the Amazon I'd once respected, not wanting to recognize what it had become. Over and over, I hoped things would improve, but I grew tired. I knew quitting would come with a high financial cost — I'd have to return my sign-on bonus and pay for my move to Nashville — but in October 2024, eleven weeks into my Amazon return, I resigned. I decided I'd rather have no job than work for a company I didn't trust or respect anymore. In his recent letter about the five-day RTO plans, CEO Andy Jassy described reducing layers of leadership to increase employees' ability to move fast, take ownership, and increase innovation for customers. That only solves half the problem. Amazon has too many layers of management and too many ineffectual leaders. The Amazon I joined in 2016 thrummed a "fail fast and often" mentality, encouraging risk-taking that led to delightful innovations. The Amazon I rejoined in 2024 slogs along play-acting the peculiar ways, creating an environment of process obsession instead of customer obsession. I hope they can right the ship, but I won't be around to find out. In response to Business Insider's inquiry, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said that Amazon was ranked second on LinkedIn's Top Companies list this year and first in LinkedIn's Top Companies in Technology and Information. Stephanie Ramos writes about life and finance as a corporate escapee and single, child-free woman on Substack.

Title: Leading The Workplace In A Second Trump Era

This week’s Future of Work newsletter dives into managing post-election uncertainty, the best employers for veterans and shares, exclusively, news that global hiring platform Oyster has netted a funding round extension. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Signage is pictured at a warehouse on October 29, 2024 in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Hannah Beier/Getty Images) We’re now six days out from last week’s historic election, one that ushered in a new world order of uncertainty, increased tribalism and—depending on your employee base—either elation or dramatically heightened fear. But as we move into our post-election reality—and as questions surrounding what leaders should say about the results give way to questions about what to do next—leading teams with integrity amid chaos will matter more than ever. Helping people find focus in a world full of distractions will be necessary as many employees are left feeling unsettled. And we’ll all need more ways to calm and regulate workplace stress amid growing uncertainty. What will tariffs mean when it comes to job creation? Senior contributor Jack Kelly takes a look at the potential impact if President-elect Donald Trump were to follow through on his threats to implement new tariffs, suggesting there could be an increase in employment opportunities in sectors directly benefiting from tariffs, such as companies scaling up domestic production. At the same time, “small businesses, which often operate with slimmer margins, might struggle more with the increased costs due to tariffs, potentially leading to closures or reduced employment,” Kelly writes. He also examines what a job search amid a presidential election transition could look like. For more on what a Trump presidency might mean on policy issues—like the minimum wage or DEI initiatives—keep reading below. This week, we also have exclusive news on new funding in global hiring platform Oyster, and as it’s Veteran’s Day, we also have our latest ranking on the best employers for veterans. Here’s to a new week. Though written before election results came in, my colleague Maria Gracia Santillana Linares examined why there wasn’t more talk about the minimum wage during the election season. (Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have both supported eliminating taxes on tips, and Trump has said he would end them on overtime pay.) Two big reasons: Change has been focused at the state level for at least the past 15 years, ever since the last time Congress passed a law enshrining a new minimum wage, and those local efforts have vastly narrowed the number of people who still work at or below the federal minimum wage to just 1.1% of U.S. workers in 2023. What will Trump’s election mean for diversity, equity and inclusion programs? HR Dive writes that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Trump will likely take a “more narrow view of what’s permissible under DEI initiatives,” quoting Jim Paretti, former senior counsel at the acting chair of the EEOC. “I think DEI in a Republican administration is going to be under a lot more scrutiny, a lot more limitations, by way of the government power of the purse,” Paretti said. The same morning as Election Day, Boeing’s striking factory workers voted to accept the company’s revised contract offer, which promised a larger wage increase and bonus payments, writes Forbes’ Siladitya Ray. The deal ended a seven-week-long work stoppage, setting the stage for the crisis-ridden company to restart production lines. Forbes recently published its fifth annual ranking of America’s Best Employers For Veterans, which is based on survey responses from more than 24,000 veterans (those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Reserves or the National Guard) working for companies with more than 1,000 employees in the United States. Respondents were asked if they would recommend their company or institution to friends and family, and to rate their employer on several criteria. This year’s No. 1? Salesforce. Read on here to learn more about the rest. Oyster CEO and cofounder Tony James On Monday, global hiring platform Oyster, Forbes can report exclusively, will announce a $5 million extension to its recent $59 million Series D funding round, which valued the company at $1.2 billion. The most recent investment, from ServiceNow Ventures, brings the company’s total funding to $291 million as it aims to compete with even bigger rivals, such as Deel, which is seen as a possible IPO candidate. Just before the new announcement, Forbes spoke with cofounder and CEO Tony Jamous who, appropriately enough for a company that helps employers hire people globally, is based in Paphos, Cyprus. Excerpts below from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. There’s a lot of players in this space, and one—Deel—that’s particularly big. How do you distinguish yourself? We saw the team members on our platform in emerging economies grow from less than 30% to more than 40% in two years. That’s what we call our impact ratio. Our rivals are going horizontal—launching HRIS platforms, they have engagement management platforms, domestic payroll. We are only interested in helping domestic companies hire in other countries. We’re focused on making global hiring as easy as local hiring. We want to make the planet Earth look like one job market. We are here for a purpose. We’re here to make the world more free and equal, democratizing access to global job opportunities. … I’d love for Deel to be extremely successful with their [potential] IPO. Please, God, help them—because it’s going to open the market for everybody. Following Amazon’s announcement about requiring five days in office, are you seeing any impact from companies wanting to hire fewer people in remote locales? We see that from big companies. They make the news. We don’t see that in our customer base. It’s a no-brainer for them to tap into the global talent pool when it comes to cost efficiency, when it comes to diversity and when it comes to accessibility to talent. … We are giving the smaller companies a super power when it comes to their talent strategy. Our growth shows that. … We grew revenues 60% last year. You recently had a big funding round. Tell me how you’re putting that to work. We’ve launched Global Payroll to help customers employ in their existing overseas entities. Importantly, we’re not competing with domestic payroll. Just cross-border. We’re also excited about growing through M&A. Our organic activity remains our top priority, but we want to remain acquisitive and opportunistic in our ability to accelerate. Third [would be] about reaching profitability. This business is an economy of scale business. How difficult was it to raise funding in this environment? The whole technology sector’s been in a [state of] constant fear. Chronic fear. Nobody knew where the valuations were headed, where the market expectations were headed. I started fundraising since the market shifted. Day one. Building relationships with investors early on, telling the story of Oyster. We shifted our focus into operational efficiency very rapidly. What are you seeing from your customers about their interest in hiring? Much, much [fewer] layoffs are happening. That was a trend that started a couple of months ago we hope will continue. The genie is out of the box. Globalization of the workforce is going to happen the same way globalization of commerce happened. The key is not to generate fear for the person in Chicago. It’s an opportunity for the person in the Philippines to ask for increasing pay and improve their life conditions. But the person in Chicago is still out of a job, no? There’s a downside for them. There are 80 million jobs going unfilled in the West. There’s a job shortage. … There is a massive need for knowledge workers to work for companies in the West that cannot be filled with the amount of workers that are available. It’s open enrollment season for benefits. A new survey from Corebridge Financial looks at how employers can best support their workers—at a time when choices are more important than ever for workers to get right. 18%: The percentage of workers who find the process of open enrollment confusing and complex 68%: The percentage of both Gen Z and Millennial workers who want their employers to provide one-on-one support for enrolling in new benefits “Personalization is key. People are in different stages of their lives and may have different benefit needs.”— Terri Fiedler, President, Retirement Services at Corebridge Financial How to infuse your messaging with your company’s values Here are four work habits to develop before year’s end How leaders can address workplace anxiety after the 2024 election A Jeff Bezos-owned brand said last week it would expect workers back in the office five days a week next year and move away from its current hybrid schedule in 2025.

Title: Amazon Has Slashed Its US Ad Spend by $700 Million This Year

Time Published: 2024-11-11T11:00:00Z

As Amazon’s revenue and stock price continue to climb, the company is also pulling back. Between January and August, Amazon cut its core retail business’s U.S. ad spend by 20%—equivalent to $700 million—compared to the same time in 2023, according to estimates from ad intelligence platform MediaRadar. The drop from $3.4 billion to $2.7 billion comes amid other cost-cutting measures across the company under CEO Andy Jassy, who took control of the ecommerce giant after founder Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021. Amazon has shut down brick-and-mortar stores, such as the Go convenience chain and grocery services. It’s also undergone rounds of layoffs. Annual reports reveal the company shrunk from around 1.61 million full- and part-time employees in 2021 to 1.53 million last year. Overall, Amazon’s global investment in advertising and other promotional costs related to its various products and services, from Twitch to Whole Foods to Amazon Web Services, has decreased from $20.6 billion in 2022 to $20.3 billion in 2023, per its annual reports. For MediaRadar’s analysis of retailers’ U.S. ad spend, it limited its focus on Amazon to the company’s core retail business. Amazon’s Ad Business Grew Faster Than the Company’s Overall Growth in Q3 These cost reductions appear to be working. Amazon reported $17.4 billion in operating income during its recent third-quarter earnings, up 55% year over year. “We’ve definitely seen Amazon increase their margins over the past couple of quarters,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder and CEO of retail research firm Marketplace Pulse. In total, retailers Amazon, Walmart, Temu, Target, and Shein spent $5.6 billion on advertising between January and August 2024, representing a 11% year-over-year decrease. Amazon, Target, Walmart, Shein, and Temu either declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Ad spending, however, fluctuates by retailer. Temu’s investment in paid media, for example, grew 13%—indicative of the Chinese-based retailer’s continued increase in ad spending. Despite Temu’s high-priced Super Bowl ads the past couple of years, 77% of Temu’s advertising dollars went toward digital this year, according to MediaRadar. Kaziukėnas said Temu’s heavy reliance on digital ads—usually ads that promote specific products—shows how the retailer hasn’t become a mainstream name for U.S. consumers. “Relative to other retailers, Temu has a high ratio of sales coming from advertising,” he said. “It has very little stickiness and perpetually has to spend on advertising to remind people that it exists.” Meanwhile, China-based Shein’s ad spend dropped by 49% year-over-year—though from a significantly smaller base than Temu. Unlike Temu, Shein doesn’t need to spend on advertising to acquire customers because it’s more well-known and drives organic sales from social media and other channels, Kaziukėnas said. “They can afford to spend less on marketing to get the sales they need,” he said. Elsewhere, Target’s ad spend dropped 9%, while Walmart’s increased 9% during the same period. Lauren Johnson is Adweek's deputy editor of retail media and commerce.

Title: What needs to go right for Intel, and what happens if it doesn't
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-dow-jones-ai-chip-lag-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-11T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
US policymakers are still betting that Intel is the nation's best shot at manufacturing chips. It's a long shot. The S&P Dow Jones Indices said on November 1 that Intel is losing its 25-year spot to Nvidia in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel's stock has dropped nearly 50% so far this year, and the company has faced billions in losses. It's also had sweeping layoffs, buyouts, and other setbacks. The many moving parts of Intel's strategy could still help it recover from its recent setbacks if they're executed well. Business Insider spoke with industry analysts to ask what should go right for Intel to get back on track. Intel has specifically lagged in the age of generative AI compared to competitors like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD, which have their chips produced by Taiwan-based chip giant TSMC. BI's Alistair Barr previously wrote that since Intel is the only company manufacturing high-powered chips on American soil at scale, rather than outsourcing the job to Taiwan, the company is a key part of the bedrock of the country's technology ecosystem. "Chips power the modern economy," he wrote. "If you have to get these components overseas, you're vulnerable." Given lawmakers' keen geopolitical and economic interests in maintaining the US's technological advantage, that means weighing all possible outcomes for Intel's future as the company struggles to gain its footing in the AI race. "What's going on in Intel is not good, and being removed from the Dow is just sort of the cherry on the sundae," said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's 18A process technology is key to its strategy and its next shot at a new process node after struggling with previous node upgrades. If the technology succeeds, Intel can win over customers and turn itself around. Intel has executed five improved chip nodes in the last four years, resulting in smaller and more powerful transistors, "which is a feat in itself," said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst of Moor Insights and Strategy. Still, in recent years, Intel has failed to keep up with TSMC in the latest chip nodes. Moorhead added that Intel is investing to "catch up" to its competitors. "Its 18A node appears to be healthy and competitive, which is the key to its turnaround and the ability to recruit more foundry customers," Moorhead said. Intel has announced Amazon as an 18A customer so far. "You have to trust Intel to manufacture your chips on advanced processes, which they've just started adopting, efficiently and on time which they haven't done yet," said Logan Purk, a senior analyst at Edward Jones. Intel plans to spin out its semiconductor manufacturing business into an independent subsidiary called Intel Foundry, separating the manufacturing process from its chip-design business. For this to work, the foundry business will need other major companies, including its rivals, to use Intel to manufacture their chip designs in large volumes. This hasn't happened yet. Other chip companies that have separated their manufacturing and designing have succeeded, said Dan Morgan, a senior trust portfolio manager at Synovus. He pointed to AMD spinning off its manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries as an example, and he estimated that Intel's foundry business alone could be valued as high as $80 billion. Highlighting Intel's challenge here, GlobalFoundries only has a market cap of just $24 billion as of publication time. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also said that Intel is making progress in cutting costs in their recent staff reductions and real estate sales. "Balance sheet is an area of focus for investors given the company's aggressive capex plan and ongoing losses in the foundry business," Morgan said. Rasgon said Intel is facing a "dire emergency" but likely isn't so desperate as to declare bankruptcy or sell off portions of its business at a fire sale price. Moreover, Intel still holds over 75% of the market share of data center chips and PCs. "It's not like the company's just bleeding out," Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology research and advisory firm Futurum Group, told BI. Washington's concerns about Intel have become a sharper focus as the company has continued to slip from its spot as a top chipmaker. Intel is set to receive billions from the federal government under the CHIPS and Science Act to boost American semiconductor manufacturing — though the company hasn't received any funds yet. If Intel can contain costs and efficiently apply its grant funding, Newman said, "there is a possibility that it could get back to a level of profitability that would make it sustainable." The government has taken other steps to boost Intel. Gina Raimondo, the US secretary of commerce, took multiple private meetings and calls to urge chief executives from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and other firms to buy chips from Intel to shore up the company's manufacturing wing and solidify its role in US-based chip production," The New York Times reported last month. Under Donald Trump's presidential administration, Intel could receive support for domestic manufacturing while facing higher tariffs and pushback on the CHIPS Act. "Under the incoming administration, which arguably has an even greater nationalist tone, homegrown companies actually stand to benefit," said Purk. Not everyone is convinced that government intervention will help Intel get back on track in chip manufacturing. "It's all fine and dandy for the government to say, 'Yeah, we want you to use Intel,'" Rasgon said. "Like, that's great, but it's not going to happen unless Intel can deliver." Intel's foundry business has been slow to take off, and the potential for it to reinvigorate the American chipmaking landscape hasn't stopped rumblings about a possible breakup — with competitors like Qualcomm reportedly interested in buying parts of Intel — or policymakers in Washington discussing potential contingency plans. Officials from the Commerce Department and Sen. Mark Warner, who championed the CHIPS Act, met for precautionary strategy talks to discuss how the government should support Intel if it needs more help, Semafor reported. The report said they also discussed a potential merger between the company's chip design business and a competitor like AMD or Marvell. "If, for some reason, this foundry thing continues to take longer, the losses continue to mount, the technological progress does not take hold, sales falter, or the company's ability to stay together does, I do believe that they are setting it up in that direction to be able to have options — whether they spin it off and take it public separately, or bring private equity into it, or they're able to bring a buyer to the table," Newman said. Intel, the Commerce Department, and a representative for Warner did not respond to requests for comment from BI. Jump to

Title: To establish value, focus more on high priority projects: Reading Michael Lynch's post on why he quit Google to work for himself

by Tom Johnson on Nov 11, 2024 categories: technical-writing Although this post by Michael Lynch titled Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself was published in 2018, it trended on Hacker News last week. It caught my attention because I recently underwent a similar promotion process, though with a positive outcome. Lynch, an engineer, highlights a couple of points relevant to technical writers: writing documentation doesn't support an engineer's demonstration of technical complexity, and the projects you work on might matter more than the quality of your output. Documentation dDoesn’t help engineering promotions The importance of working on high-impact projects Documentation dDoesn’t help engineering promotions First, in one of his attempts at promotion, he noted that in one of his projects, he even “documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head.” The cartoon graphic in his post then says, “I documented this component that nobody understood.” To which the committee responds, “Anyone can write documentation. Where are the metrics proving it helped Google?” Writing docs is not important for engineering promotion As engineers focus on projects with high technical complexity, writing documentation will be an insignificant footnote for most hiring committees. It’s not a factor in a promo packet where an engineer would demonstrate how they fixed a problem of significant technical complexity. Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn’t fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they’re capable of writing. Lynch writes, “I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn’t proven I could handle technical complexity ….” The importance of working on high-impact projects The second highlight from this post is Lynch’s attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains: “To continue advancing my career, I’d need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams.” If you work on projects no one cares about, it’s also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I’m in. The products are a profit center with many big-name partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I’m the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the business interests of the company, then no matter how exceedingly awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn’t matter much because the product area wouldn’t be significant to the positive impact of the company. I’ve written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my seven-part series Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off.) Lynch’s post suggests that it doesn’t matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I seemed to intuitively understand this, because I’ve consistently gravitated toward providing documentation for what I perceive to be the most important projects in a company. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it’s the automotive API products. In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? Sure, if a product has an upcoming release, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize doc fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there’s a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company? In one comment on Hacker News by “nostrademons”, an engineering manager explains: “Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager. The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do …” I’m more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where I work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where I seem to coast. No one seems to notice or care. What matters is your general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, your manager’s ability to understand that and to highlight your involvement in those projects, spinning up your role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.

Title: Big Tech’s hotbeds of employee activism quiet after Trump’s victory
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2024/11/11/big-techs-hotbeds-of-employee-activism-quiet-after-trumps-victory

Full Content:
Monday, 11 Nov 2024 Google employees in New York walk out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment claims on Nov 1, 2018. Tech sector executives have worked to dampen employee activism in recent years, a push reflected in workers’ muted public reaction to Donald Trump’s re-election. — The New York Times SEATTLE: If any industry could have said its workplaces were politicised, it was tech. Early in Donald Trump’s first term in the White House, America’s tech giants loudly protested his temporary ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, posted that his great-grandparents were immigrants and that his in-laws were refugees. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, rushed to San Francisco International Airport to protest. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, joined a crowd of employees rallying at the company’s corporate headquarters. “Wow, thank you everyone for showing up today,” he said to cheers. “It’s remarkable.” But after this week’s presidential election, the largely liberal workforces of tech’s biggest companies were quiet. While the definitive nature of the election most likely played a role, the change also represented an effort by executives to dampen employee activism in recent years. They put in place policies restricting dialogue, monitored internal chat channels and vowed not to weigh in on the issues that fired up activist employees. If the presidential election was going to be the biggest test of these new rules, the vigilance wasn’t necessary. Reactions to the election on company message boards and forums were muted. On a companywide Google forum, someone posted an American flag with the note, “Sending support to American colleagues,” which was liked by more than 1,000 employees. “My heart is heavy,” one Amazon employee wrote in an internal chat. “I may not know you, but know that I love you.” The heads of most of the country’s leading tech employers didn’t acknowledge the election results to their staffs, though many of them posted their congratulations to Trump on X, praising his “decisive” and “hard-fought” victory. "Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on his decisive victory,” Pichai wrote on X. “We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone.” Amazon, Meta and Google declined to comment. Trump’s victory landed in an industry deeply changed since his last term. Tech companies had long espoused the idea of bringing your whole self to work, and they were built on a culture of blunt expression. But the turmoil of the past several years — from the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 to the war in the Gaza Strip — have turned off executives from the freewheeling cultures they once fostered. And as they have focused their companies on efficiency coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have also taken a more assertive approach to their own workers, enacting in some cases the largest layoffs in their histories and demanding that people return to working in an office — or show themselves the door. Google since 2019 has instructed employees to keep politics out of the workplace, and this year the company cracked down on its irreverent Memegen forum, its corporate town square, after workers feuded about the war in Gaza. On Monday, Pichai reminded his 181,000 employees not to discuss politics in the workplace regardless of who won the election, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times. “Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief,” Pichai wrote. The company is “at its best” when focusing on its mission and products, he added. Employees largely had conversations in smaller groups and more private forums. A few looked for ways to express their discontent without drawing the attention of the company’s internal content moderators. The moderators were removing political posts and temporarily suspending uploading privileges for employees who repeatedly broke the rules, said three people with knowledge of the moderation, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. CNBC earlier reported on the takedowns and Pichai’s email. Moderators also took down vague posts without captions that were assumed to be about the election, one of the people said, including a number of posts featuring black squares, a symbol of mourning. Meta’s human resources department, with support from Zuckerberg, introduced a policy in late 2022 called “community engagement expectations,” according to a copy of the memo reviewed by the Times. It expressly forbade employees to discuss in the workplace hot-button political issues, including abortion, racial justice movements, wars and political news. Amazon’s senior leaders pulled back this year on issuing frequent statements on political or cultural issues, according to three people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several Amazon executives spoke about the future in a two-hour companywide meeting and did not mention the election once. Andy Jassy, the company’s CEO, defended its office mandate against claims it was a “backdoor layoff,” expressed hope in the company’s AI innovations and praised experiments to deliver eggs faster to customers. But the real test of tech’s newfound neutrality will be once Trump takes office, if he follows through on his promises on issues the companies have opposed. “Remember the famous travel ban?” he said at a September rally. He vowed to bring it back. – ©2024 The New York Times Company Related stories: What will Trump 2.0 mean for US tech?Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Before the US election, tech CEOs were quietly courting TrumpTech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Tech giants brace for AI revamp, antitrust pullback in Trump 2.0 Topic: Report it to us.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Former Google lead Andrew Yeung has been dubbed the Gatsby of Silicon Valley. He shared the coffee chat formula that's helped him grow his seven-figure tech event business. On the agenda today: But first: What happens next after Donald Trump's resounding US election victory. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The most expensive presidential election in history is over, and the effects of Donald Trump's victory are already being felt in dollars and cents. Stocks surged, finishing the week at record highs. Bitcoin also hit record highs, while Tesla surpassed a $1 trillion market cap. Treasury yields also finished the week higher, as investors bet that a Trump White House will drive inflation. Big companies are already weighing the potential impact of tariffs. Outdoors brand Yeti is looking for new suppliers. Steve Madden plans to cut its sourcing of goods from China. Airbus said it expects to pass the cost of any tariffs on to airline customers. In Silicon Valley, many venture capitalists and startup founders are cheering the prospect of less regulation and increased deal activity. On Wall Street, too, there's hope of less onerous regulation, particularly as several financiers are offering advice to the incoming administration. And at least one media CEO hopes Trump's win will open the doors to consolidation. Goldman Sachs promoted 95 executives to its highest designation of leaders outside the C-suite. The new class is the largest number of partners to be promoted under CEO David Solomon. It's also one of Goldman's most diverse. A record 26 are women — a demographic that has been closely watched following a series of high-profile female partner exits — as well as a record level of Hispanic executive promotions, a company exec said. Check out the list. Also read: In an all-hands meeting this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the company's recent plan to reduce the number of managers. According to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI, Jassy said the move was meant to root out bureaucracy. The goal is to make faster decisions and reduce management layers that are killing Amazon's unique culture, Jassy said. "The reality is that the S team and I hate bureaucracy," Jassy said, referring to Amazon's most senior leadership team. More from the all-hands meeting.

There, he met one of the hosts who would eventually advise him to invest in financial products that ultimately cost him a chunk of his retirement savings. Why these 'free lunch seminars' are common in the industry. Regular Americans are shoplifting everything from tape measures to blocks of cheese. Rather than stealing out of true necessity, these shoplifters are opportunists: adults with decent jobs, firmly in the middle class. And they don't feel particularly bad about it. Some of them view shoplifting as a silly childhood habit they never kicked out, while others think of it as a way to fight back against goods that are unjustly expensive.

Title: Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Empire in Trouble?

Time Published: 2024-11-08T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | November 8, 2024 | For the past 16 years, Goop has been one of the shining lights in the celebrity business sphere. Gwyneth Paltrow’s woo-woo wellness company has endured a lot of jokes (and extremely legitimate criticism about its suspect claims and the people it supports), but it’s remained a major hit. In 2018, the New York Times reported that Goop was worth an estimated $250 million, thanks to its unusual wellness offerings like psychic vampire repellent and jade vagina eggs. Not bad for what started out as a newsletter by a bored actress. But now, reports are suggesting that Goop is stumbling. Last year, Goop opened a store in London, which closed quickly due to lack of interest. RadarOnline is claiming that closure led to around a $2 million loss for the company. Last week, Business Insider reported that Goop had undergone a second round of layoffs in only two months. In 2021, they also reported that 140 employees left the company in just two years. Among the issues cited were low salaries, poor leadership, and favoritism among the higher ranks. Yes, the pandemic shutdown didn’t help but the bleeding doesn’t seem to have stopped for Goop. Over the past month, things have gotten bad enough that The Times suggested that Goop is undergoing an entire business reshuffle just to stay afloat. Puck also got in on the act, reporting that, while Goop’s food vertical is doing well, the fashion and beauty parts are suffering. This is bad news given that they only recently launched a skincare line, available via Target. Puck wrote: Yikes. Puck then had sources saying that Paltrow seemed to have ‘disdain’ for some of the products she was selling, although Goop denied this in a statement. Goop has always been a strange and unique presence in the world of celebrity branding. It’s so specifically Gwyneth and so deliberately inaccessible to the biggest markets and demographics that it shouldn’t have worked. Yet it became the benchmark for the celeb business model for years, with many a copycat (hello, Blake Lively) and wannabes following in its bare footsteps. Goop was widely derided for questionable science and promotion of straight-up quackery but there is also a known and monied audience who love that crap. Paltrow was savvy in commodifying all of this faux-wellness nonsense and selling it to her fellow rich white ladies. She was also extremely good at monetising those rage clicks and playing along with her own parodic image, as evidenced by that vagina candle that sadly exploded from time to time. So, what changed? The wellness industry certainly hasn’t died; it’s only grown more powerful and intimidating since lockdown, and my Instagram feed is full of ‘self-care’ routines that are merely extended ads for a lot of Temu and Amazon crap. Rich lady companies are doing fine too, because that’s a demographic that stays rich regardless of the changing political tides. I don’t think it’s that we’re suddenly aware that Goop was peddling bullsh*t either. Sadly, snake oil and anti-pharma-driven rhetoric is extremely popular right now, and on all sides of the political spectrum. To me, it seems like Goop has never been a hugely reliable profit maker for Paltrow. She herself admitted that at a business summit with Forbes, saying, ‘Some years, we’ve doubled in growth. Some years, we are flat. Some years, we’re down, then we’re back up.’ She wasn’t a businesswoman who jumped into a gap in the market. She was an actress whose side-project became a thing and she went along with it. Plus, while there is a niche for what she sells, it’s not as wide as would be needed to sustain a multi-pronged, Fenty-esque empire. Selling your makeup line in Target at an affordable price is a good idea, but nobody expects Goop to be affordable or for the masses, least of all people who go to Target and know what they want. If you’re looking for a moisturizer and one of the celebs shilling it to you has a dodgy history with pseudoscience and also radiates ‘eat the poors,’ why would you buy it? Both skincare and clothing are crowded markets, even without the celeb brands in the mix. Where once everyone chased Gwyneth, now they all follow after Rihanna, and Fenty Beauty and Skin are killing it. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty is a billion-dollar brand too. Plenty of celebrities have tried and failed to make their brands in this field a hit. It’s an expensive gamble and even the biggest skincare addicts are hesitant to put all that money down for a new product just because a famous name is attached. At least with a booze line, you can still get drunk. If Goop is to survive, my guess is that it will be under someone else’s ownership. Puck certainly seemed to believe that a sale could happen in the future, which would make Paltrow even richer and probably result in more layoffs. Goop’s legacy is secure, but not in a great way. It was a landmark in modern celebrity branding, but it also further legitimized entire swaths of fake science, wellness nonsense, and quackery that was one step removed from anti-vax propaganda. As much as Paltrow tried to laugh off criticism and embrace her ‘white lady bullsh*t’ image, the reverberations of bad science and health-driven fearmongering are far mightier than a vagina candle.

Title: Is generative AI hitting a ceiling? Maybe, but investors don’t care

UPDATED 10:37 EST / NOVEMBER 08 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Of course the presidential election looms over everything, and I’ll just say one thing: Any executives or investors counting on President-elect Donald Trump keeping the vast majority of promises he has made are not as smart as they think they are. Maybe they just want their taxes and regulations cut, and they may well get those. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who believe we will now be entering a wonderland of building under a Trump administration, wonder if generative AI models are hitting their limits. A few other people have been baying at the moon about this for a while, so it’s worth pondering what that means for the current boom. Nonetheless, even if the current approach by some to create AGI isn’t the right way to go, that doesn’t mean there isn’t utility for users today, so investors keep pouring the money into AI companies such as Anthropic, Perplexity and Physical Intelligence. Speaking of big spending, those plans by Amazon, Meta and Google to jumpstart nuclear plants to power all that AI? They could take a while. An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management this week calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions — few of which seem all that compelling ways to spur innovation. It’s still not entirely clear what’s going on with Supermicro’s books, but investors don’t like the signs one bit as its stock tanked again this week as its revenue missed estimates as well. Other earnings reports came in decidedly mixed. Arm and Qualcomm did pretty well partly on AI momentum, and so did GlobalFoundries, but NXP not so much. Cloudflare and Akamai also provided disappointing guidance. Broadcom expanded its VMware private-cloud options, which could prove good timing for the special edge needs of AI. Next week is KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City. TheCUBE will be there and SiliconANGLE will have the news and analysis. I’ll be at BoxWorks in San Francisco too. Earnings reports slow down, but next week we’ll be looking at Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, among a few others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: Breaking Analysis: Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s biggest competitor Are generative AI models topping out in their capabilities? Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz think they are, at least for now. Some people warned us. David Linthicum digs in: What do multimodal AI and smaller language models mean for enterprises? A glimpse with George Gilbert into Uber’s cutting-edge data approach: Uber revamps its operating model with real-time data and microservice orchestration Federal court sides with OpenAI in AI copyright lawsuit Hedge fund Coatue is raising $1B for AI bets Amazon reportedly mulls another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic – but with an added twist Perplexity AI’s value to soar to $9B as it finalizes new $500M funding round AIs will need physical knowledge at least as much as text knowledge, so perhaps feedback from robots using AI brains will help: AI startup Physical Intelligence raises $400M to create a brain for any robot Siit raises $5M for its AI-powered service desk platform Nvidia announces new robot AI learning and simulation tools Anthropic partners with AWS and Palantir to provide AI models to defense agencies UnifyApps reels in $20M for its AI-powered application platform Diliko launches agentic AI-powered data management platform for midsized enterprises MuleSoft helps businesses create real-time AI agents with AsyncAPI support View Systems launches AI-optimized data management platform There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Amazon, Meta nuclear power initiatives reportedly encounter challenges An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions. Perhaps some of those are good ideas in concept, but it’s not that convincing to me, especially the stock buybacks front and center. One would hope Andy Jassy and Matt Garman have better ideas. (Though admittedly they could have done a lot better on “Rings of Power.”) Cloudbrink co-founder’s lawsuit draws attention of the SEC and DOJ Supermicro’s stock falls on revenue miss and uncertainty over annual filing, increasing fears of a delisting Qualcomm and Arm cruise to another earnings and revenue beat NXP tumbles on weak outlook as automotive chip revenue declines GlobalFoundries shares jump on strong mobile business growth Kyndryl sees good traction with AI consulting services, and its stock moves higher Disappointing guidance sends Cloudflare and Akamai stocks lower Datadog tops earnings expectations amid cybersecurity, AI growth Rapid7’s revenue and earnings top forecasts amid product enhancements Fortinet shares dip despite beating revenue and earnings estimates Dynatrace shares close lower despite strong second quarter Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand DigitalOcean shares drop 13% despite expectation-topping earnings, raised guidance Astera Labs delivers blowout earnings and revenue beat and its stock jumps Palantir shares surge over 12% on strong earnings and raised revenue outlook Lyft shares surge over 20% as revenue growth outpaces expectations despite earnings miss HubSpot earnings top forecasts with 20% revenue growth and customer gains Five9 shares surge over 20% following strong quarter and upgraded guidance JFrog’s stock stutters on lukewarm guidance, despite accelerating revenue and customer wins And more… Broadcom broadens private cloud options And Zeus Kerravala’s analysis: VMware’s bevy of updates to VCF at Explore Barcelona 2024: Here’s why they matter AMD overtook Intel for the first time in data center revenue in the third quarter, according to SemiAnalysis TSMC, GlobalFoundries reportedly complete CHIPS Act funding negotiations EU launches antitrust probe into Apple glass supplier Corning IonQ snaps up quantum networking company Qubitekk, but financial results disappoint investors Rackspace offers GPUs as a cloud service with spot instance pricing We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps CrowdStrike acquires cloud security provider Adaptive Shield Malwarebytes acquires VPN provider AzireVPN Attack & response That’s a lot of dough: Ransomware gang demands ransom payment in Schneider Electric data breach: baguettes Canada arrests suspected hacker over breach of 160+ Snowflake users’ data Google’s Big Sleep AI model sets world first with discovery of SQLite security flaw City of Columbus acknowledges data theft after lawsuit against security researcher JFrog report highlights critical security flaws in machine learning platforms White-noise apps exploited in major audio ad fraud schemes, report finds Fortinet expands generative AI in cybersecurity portfolio with new FortiAI integrations Permiso launches three open-source tools to enhance cloud security detection Kloudfuse enhances observability platform with AI tools and scalable data management More cybersecurity news here Amazon gets green light to start drone deliveries in Arizona Lyft inks new partnerships to make autonomous taxis available through its app TikTok told to close its business in Canada amid national security concerns Bad timing for the New York Times as its tech union goes on strike And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Mozilla‘s open internet advocacy efforts falter as it lays off 30% of its staff Gabor Cselle, co-founder and former CEO of defunct X rival Pebble, has joined OpenAI to work on a “secretive project” (per TechCrunch).Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta’s former head of augmented reality hardware, is also joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware.

Title: Airbnb is on the hunt for growth

Good morning. Jay-Z has 99 problems, but Block ain’t one…for now, anyway. Executives at the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey—or is it Rick Rubin? I can barely tell their beards apart these days—have ordered staff not to mention the board member and Beyoncé spouse on internal channels, according to Fortune colleague Kali Hays. No one’s quite sure why, but successive layoffs at music streaming service Tidal—which Block quixotically bought from Jay-Z—haven’t helped. Perhaps Dorsey should channel zenmaster-megaproducer Rubin after all: “Do what you can with what you have. Nothing more is needed.” —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. Airbnb said Thursday it wants to accelerate its growth and prepare for the company’s next chapter “beyond accommodations.” In a letter to shareholders, the lodging marketplace said it made headway making it easier for people to host, making its namesake app more helpful (including clearing out low-quality listings), and expanding beyond its core markets. The last point is most interesting. Airbnb operates in a number of countries and regions it considers “under-penetrated.” In Q3, the company said it was able to boost the average growth rate of nights booked in those markets to more than double its core set. Airbnb reported $2.73 billion in third-quarter revenue, barely beating Wall Street’s estimates. It also reported earnings per share of $2.13, just missing expectations. As for its future beyond lodging? We’ll see “next year,” the company says. Speculation runs rampant for what that means, but rest assured the company will leverage its strength in building a “moat,” as CEO Brian Chesky put it last year, around its existing customer base. —AN Baidu is reportedly preparing to unveil a pair of smart glasses with a built-in AI assistant. A new Bloomberg report says the company, which is to China what Google is to the U.S., plans to showcase the product at its annual company event in Shanghai next week. The specs will have all the usual trappings: built-in cameras for photos and videos, a built-in microphone for voice interactions, and Baidu’s Ernie large language model underpinning it all. Hopefully the product will look as good as Meta’s Ray-Bans, which were released more than a year ago in partnership with global eyewear juggernaut EssilorLuxottica. The combination of tech and style has proven unbeatable—who doesn’t look good in a pair of Blues Brothers-esque Wayfarers?—even if the underlying tech is getting long in the tooth. Baidu will reportedly charge less than Meta’s $300 for its eyewear, which is expected early next year. But like Meta’s specs, the real question is how well it accelerates use of its various Internet-connected, ad-based services where the revenue is really made. —AN Remember the days when people were having conversations about armies theoretically using AI? Now AI has been used in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza (for drone piloting and target identification respectively) and AI companies are jostling for space at the Defense Department’s table. Days after Meta announced a bouquet of partnerships with military contractors, Anthropic, Palantir and Amazon Web Services have revealed a three-headed competitor. Anthropic’s Claude LLM will be integrated into Palantir’s intelligence-analysis system, with the whole thing running on AWS. Amazon is Anthropic’s biggest investor, and the pair already offer their joint services to the U.S. government. OpenAI, which quietly changed its terms earlier in the year to allow this, is also now looking for DOD business. It’s now the military-AI-industrial complex. —David Meyer Shares of Pinterest took a double-digit-percentage dive, to about $29, in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company offered fourth-quarter guidance below Wall Street’s expectations. The social media company said it expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. The midpoint of that range trails analyst estimates of $1.143 billion. Pinterest’s CFO, Julia Donnelly, said on a conference call that the company saw softer demand from food and beverage advertisers in Q3, dragging down its $898 million in quarterly revenue (which was otherwise up 18% from the same period last year). That will continue in Q4, she said—which aligns with the outlook of other ad-based businesses during the recent spate of corporate earnings reports. Another thing to note? Pinterest’s expenses. They were up 17% year over year, to $904 million, from R&D investment and spending on employees with AI expertise. —AN Tech’s biggest executives pretty much ignored Donald Trump after he won the White House in the shocking presidential election in 2016. This time around? Not so much. According to various reports over the last few months, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg privately reached out to Trump before voting began for the recent election. “They flattered him,” a New York Times summary reads. “They shared their troubles. They criticized his opposition. They emphasized common enemies.” And they hoped for better business. Trump went out of his way during his first term to criticize—or outright punish—the tech companies who opposed him. After Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2016 that Trump’s stated refusal to concede the election if he lost (he didn’t) “erodes our democracy around the edges,” among other things, Trump allegedly pushed the Pentagon to deny Amazon’s cloud computing unit a $10 billion defense contract. (A lawsuit was later dismissed.) Fast forward to today. The Washington Post owner published on X just two days ago: “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella all had similar things to say. And the remaining Magnificent Seven tech CEOs, you ask? Tesla’s Elon Musk has hardly slowed in posting support for Trump on X, which he owns; meanwhile Nvidia’s Jensen Huang manages to escape with a nearly nonexistent social media presence. —AN —Binance billionaire “CZ” speaks after four months in prison. —Cloudflare expects softer sales in the wake of stiffer cybersecurity competition. —Toast has a blowout quarter. Shares of the restaurant app were up 15%. (Yes, chef.) —CFPB told workers not to use phones because of hack. Living life in a Salt Typhoon. —France regulator sniffing around Polymarket gambler.

Title: Mozilla Foundation cuts staff and eliminates advocacy division, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff”

Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Greetings, comms pros! Let’s look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% of staff while also cutting its advocacy function The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit wing of the company that makes the Firefox internet browser, is cutting jobs and getting rid of its advocacy function amid “a relentless onslaught of change”. Mozilla Foundation CCO Brandon Borman affirmed the layoffs in a memo to staff. According to Tech Crunch : “The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics. Mozilla is known for advocating for privacy and inclusion on the internet. This move brings some of that ethos into question going forward. For comms pros, it’s worth asking — what do you do when your company cuts a big part of your identity as a way of remaining stable? There’s no right answer, but one of the solutions is to dive headfirst into employee experience as it ties into brand identity. Show your employees they matter and hedge that in messaging that proves you’re still the great place to work they were onboarded with originally. Organizational identities change — that’s part of business. But you can remind people that the cultural positives they relate to are the same — that’s how you communicate your way through these types of major shifts. 2 . Amazon CEO says RTO process isn’t a pretext for layoffs Amazon chief Andy Jassy denied that the company’s RTO mandate wasn’t intended as a method of covertly cutting jobs, but instead as a method of making the company’s culture stronger by having employees in the office five days a week. According to Reuters: “A number of people I’ve seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it’s a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,” said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said. It’s interesting to see the head of a company as big as Amazon address the speculation around an RTO process head-on. RTO programs should always consider culture as a guidepost for both the rollout and communication of the initiative. Any well-done RTO process needs to follow a checklist of sorts to find success. Earlier this year, we outlined RTO success points. The best RTOs can get off on the right foot by doing the following: It’s not enough to just say that culture matters — you need to show it in action. Once you call your people back, give them reasons to appreciate their time in the office, like more upskilling initiatives with colleagues and face time with leaders. There are benefits to working in the office — comms pros should highlight them, allow leaders to talk about them, and make them a central part of company culture beyond lip service. 3. NLRB files complaint against Apple for threatening employees who talked about compensation and work-from-home benefits The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against tech giant Apple, alleging that the organization threatened repercussions against employees who talked about their pay or working from home. MSN reported that according to accounts from former workers at the company, Apple employees were allegedly threatened when talking about bonuses, ordered to delete a social media post about how other employees could continue working remotely, and forced to stop mentioning their pay on internal comms platforms. Another, software engineer Cher Scarlett claimed that she was forced out of her role for creating an internal survey for employee compensation. Apple has yet to comment on the allegations. When employees feel they’re in a more open environment, they’re able to be their authentic selves and more likely to stay. In 2023, we covered the topic of job-hopping and how to combat it. In that piece, we cited a Flexjobs survey that stated 62% of employees cited toxic work environments as one of their top reasons to leaving a company, followed by pay at 59%. If your employees can’t talk about things they want to improve or their pay, there’s a good chance they won’t stick around, and those numbers prove it. Sure, Apple is one of the biggest-name corporations on the planet. But that doesn’t mean that the same rules don’t apply to employee satisfaction. Outreach via surveys and other touchpoints can help communicators gather information from employees about how they feel on topics like compensation, benefits and more. Running that info up the ladder to leaders can then affect change. Encourage your people to share their views. If you stifle them, you’re sowing the seeds for discontent and poor culture. 4.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.
