If the merger with Kroger doesn’t go through, the CEO of Albertsons Cos. Inc. said in court Wednesday that his company might have to consider layoffs and leave certain markets to remain competitive and financially secure in the long term.Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition.Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys. A merger of the two competitors would violate state antitrust laws, the attorney general’s office said.But Sankaran said the two chains see merging as the best way to compete against Walmart, first nationally in grocery sales, as well as such fast-growing food sellers as Amazon and Costco. Walmart and Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart, account for about a quarter of the country’s grocery business, he said.“We can do many things to improve the company, but at some point the ability to compete with the Amazons and Costcos and Walmarts of the world, you just need added scale. We knew we wouldn’t be able to get that by ourselves,” Sankaran said.Albertsons began looking for ways to grow and merging with another company was one of the possibilities. Soon after Albertsons and Kroger announced consolidation plans in October 2022, several United Food and Commercial Workers locals, state and local officials came out in opposition.The Federal Trade Commission has sued to put the merger on hold until it can finish its proceedings aimed at stopping the companies’ plan. A decision in the FTC’s lawsuit is pending.A trial is underway in the lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, whose complaints against the merger are similar to Colorado’s. In Colorado, Albertsons and Kroger are prime rivals in the grocery industry, according to an analysis presented by the state last week in court. The analysis produced by an expert witness for the state played down the competition posed by Costco, Amazon, Whole Foods and other retailers.But asked who he sees as Albertsons’ biggest threat, Sankaran said Walmart, Amazon and Costco are among his biggest worries. “These competitors are growing so fast and they’re already large. They’re who I worry about in the long run.”Sankaran said data on where customers in Colorado shop shows that for every $1 spent on groceries, Albertsons reaps 14 cents. Kroger takes in 16 cents and Amazon gets about 5 cents. Walmart captures the biggest share: 20 cents on the dollar. The rest of the money goes to a variety of entities, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.To try to ensure there will be competition in the market after the merger, Kroger and Albertsons have struck a $2.9 billion deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which would buy 579 of their stores nationwide. In Colorado, C&S would buy 91 Safeway and Albertsons stores and a dairy plant. Kroger would retain 14 of the stores in the state.Kroger and Albertsons have said C&S, a grocery distributor that now operates just 25 retail grocery stores, has the resources to take over the stores. But Roger Davidson, an industry consultant testifying Wednesday for the state, said he expects that stores bought by C&S will see declining revenue and some will likely close.Davidson said C&S won’t have enough people or a strong enough retail infrastructure to successfully run all the stores it plans to acquire.Jason Slothouber with the attorney general’s office asked Sankaran about the potential impacts on communities and workers if stores in more remote parts of the state close after the merger.“Even if C&S crashes and burns, you have this golden parachute for yourself,” Slothouber said.Sankaran acknowledged that he will receive a total of $43 million in equity and severance if the merger is completed. “I realize it’s a lot of money for a guy who came from India with a suitcase. I don’t take that lightly,” he said.Related Articles Retail | State says Kroger-Albertsons merger may cost Coloradans $500M per year; companies dispute claim Retail | Colorado next up to argue its case against Kroger-Albertsons mega merger Retail | Montbello’s status as a food desert to end next year with $97M project that includes grocery store, housing and more Retail | Kroger and Albertsons make a final pitch for their merger before a judge decides whether to block it Retail | A state’s experience with grocery chain mergers spurs a fight to stop Albertsons’ deal with Kroger But he called Slothhouber’s questions about stores closing and people losing their jobs “hypotheticals” that he couldn’t answer.Kroger and Albertsons have said that stores won’t close, people won’t lose their jobs and wages will increase if the merger goes through.

The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under new CEO Andy Jassy Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. "Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go." The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits.

Title: Industry Veteran Jeff Sagansky Rebukes Hollywood Studios for Decisions Leading to ‘Unbelievable Cataclysm in the Business’

TheGrill 2024: Sagansky and Peter Guber debate the transformative shift caused by the end of TV profits and rise of streaming ambitions Investor Jeff Sagansky took Hollywood to task for decisions that have led to a massive destruction of value and are causing an “unbelievable cataclysm in the business,” speaking in a keynote interview at TheWrap’s Grill conference on Tuesday. “You’re seeing the traditional business collapse,” he said in a conversation with entertainment entrepreneur Peter Guber and TheWrap’s editor in chief Sharon Waxman. “And at the same time, you’re seeing all this predatory behavior from the streamers and the two of them together are causing unbelievable cataclysm in the business that we both love.” Sagansky accused Hollywood’s traditional studios of accelerating the decline of linear television by choosing to abandon programming in favor of streaming platforms, which led to what he called “predatory” behavior from streamers. “It’s still [a] $150 billion value business in terms of revenues,” he added, noting that major sports like the NBA, MLB and NFL alone represent a $40 billion business, much smaller by contrast. Sagansky also predicted that the four leading streamers — Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney/Hulu and Max — would form an entertainment oligopoly that is likely to draw scrutiny from government regulators. Sagansky highlighted a total loss of $190 billion in value in the stock prices of major entertainment companies including Warner Bros Discovery, Disney and Paramount, noting that television, the traditional driver of the entertainment industry for half a century, has lost “almost half” of its audience. Guber, another Hollywood veteran and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and the Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner, noted that amid mass layoffs, steep cuts in production, and an anxious search for streaming profitability, there’s more uncertainty in Hollywood than ever. “There will be blood, just like the movie, but there will also be opportunity,” Guber said. “Don’t give up on entertainment. It’s been around for thousands of years. It’s not going to go away in 2025.” During the conversation, Sagansky said he is still astounded by how entertainment companies got to this point: by pushing their film and TV libraries to Netflix in response to the decline of the DVD market in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “When streaming starts, people have a choice they can make, and they make it. So what does cable do? They raised the prices. They produced less programming at a time when the building was on fire,” Sagansky said. “They just looked at their cash cow and said ‘OK, it’s over,’ and that was a fundamental mistake.” While there are differences between live sports and the rest of entertainment, Guber believes there’s one key similarity to finding success in both worlds: find a position as the bridge between artist and audience. As part of the ownership groups behind the Dodgers and Warriors, he sees those teams’ venues — the new Chase Center in San Francisco and the venerable Dodger Stadium in L.A. — as “cathedrals” that foster generational connections between teams and fans. And he said he tries to make those venues into places that people feel active in the story being told during the game. “You have to find your way through, to be active in your own rescue,” Guber said. “Don’t wait just for the government to give you a clear path. Create your own path. If you don’t, you will be on the dustbin of history.” Sagansky and Guber also discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence on filmmaking and whether it will expand or curtail opportunities for filmmakers. To see that debate, check out the clip above. (Full interview to follow.) During Tuesday’s TheGrill, five other business panels tackled different aspects of AI in Hollywood. In a panel focused on how to balance “innovation and ethics” actor and director Justine Bateman said AI would “burn the industry to the ground” by eliminating numerous job functions, which Edouard Harris, CTO of Gladstone AI, predicted that Hollywood would break off into a two-pronged system of those supporting and not supporting AI implementation. In another panel moderated by Waxman, Fox Corp. CTO Melody Hildebrandt called on the industry to take a long view on AI and be “peers to big tech in the exploitation of it.” And in a spotlight conversation, Jeffrey Bennett, SAG-AFTRA’s general counsel, broke down the timeline for what needs to happen for AI protections to be adopted nationwide. And in an afternoon session about balancing the protection of creative rights with opportunities, Alexandra Shannon, head of strategic development at CAA, detailed the creation of theCAAvault to store actors’ likenesses for use in other AI-generated applications with legal consent. Not all the day’s event dealt with AI. Two panels featured top journalists like former New York Times staffer Laura Holson, Oliver Darcy and former LA Times Executive Director Kevin Merida, discussing the state of the media industry. And in a session centered on redefining success in sports and business, WNBA Champion Sue Bird and soccer legend Megan Rapinoe, along with Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, discussed how mainstream traction for women’s sports continues to be met with gaslighting and industry resistance. “The goalpost is moving,” Rapinoe said.

Title: What went wrong at CVS?

Time Published: 2024-10-08T18:45:13Z

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Pharmacy chains are in crisis The pharmacy industry is in crisis. That's especially true at CVS, where layoffs are piling on top of layoffs — and the future of the company is in question. CVS Health announced this month that it is laying off 2,000 workers, CNN said, as part of an effort to "slash costs" across the company. That's on top of the 5,000 layoffs it announced last year, and after the company closed around 900 stores in recent years. CVS and other drug store chains are "struggling" due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, CNN said. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," said a company spokesperson. CVS' problems are also "very specific to the company," said Axios. In addition to its pharmacies, CVS is also a "major insurer" — it bought Aetna in 2017 — as well as a pharmacy benefit manager. Yes, "retail pharmacy in general is struggling," but CVS' challenges "could just be the specific businesses it has combined," Axios said. That's why company leaders are reportedly considering breaking up those businesses — an extraordinary move in an era where "vertical integration is all the rage." Escape your echo chamber.

"Satisfaction with brick-and-mortar pharmacies dropped 10 points in 2024," said Time. Customers report short-staffed outlets with "long lines and frustrating experiences." It's not just CVS: Rite Aid recently emerged from bankruptcy, and Walgreens is planning to close one-fourth of its roughly 8,600 stores. Customers simply didn't return to brick-and-mortar stores after the pandemic, preferring cheaper online alternatives. "The current pharmacy model is not sustainable," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in June. That affects communities. The mass closure of retail pharmacies is a "growing worry for health experts," said the Missouri Independent. The problem is "most acute" in places with low incomes — "urban cores" and rural areas where pharmacies are the "convenience stores of the health care system." That makes getting necessary medications a growing challenge for the people who live in those places. "When those community pharmacies close, communities lose critical access," said one expert. One other factor in the struggles of CVS and its industry: "Heavy competition" from Amazon and Walmart, said the Los Angeles Times. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) also play a role — they have "significant control" over how much insurers pay pharmacies for medications and have worked to push down those reimbursement costs. That pushes down pharmacy profitability. One irony: CVS owns Caremark, a PBM. "That's made the drug retail business more healthy," said one analyst — but it still hasn't made CVS "immune to market forces," said the Times. CVS' board is looking at "splitting the company," said The Wall Street Journal. That could be difficult. The spun-off businesses "might struggle to flourish on their own." The mergers with Aetna and Caremark were supposed to "bring down costs and give patients more convenient, accessible care." That didn't pan out. Now the future of the company is in limbo, the Journal said: CVS' board "isn't expected to make a decision soon."

Clark on Tuesday launched a new venture, called Auger, which aims to help companies and governments combine the mishmash of "Franken-software" overseeing their supply chains into a single platform. "At Flexport, I got to see all of these companies in the middle, like the Nikes or Lululemons, and I was amazed at how much of a struggle it is, and how much they still use Excel or Smartsheet or Tableau or something to bring all this disparate data together in such a way that they can do something," Clark said in an interview. "A shocking amount of supply chain still runs on Excel." Clark's third act follows a short but tumultuous stint at Flexport. Last September, Clark abruptly resigned as CEO of Flexport, allowing for the return of its founder, Ryan Petersen. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark overspent and overhired during his time at the freight forwarding startup. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark, showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Petersen has since taken steps to turn around the business by overhauling its top ranks, implementing layoffs and subleasing excess warehouse space. Before Flexport, Clark developed a storied reputation during his 23 years at Amazon as the architect of its mammoth logistics network. He joined Amazon's operations division in 1999 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most important executives at the company. In 2020, Amazon tapped Clark to head its core retail business after longtime executive Jeff Wilke left the company. Clark departed Amazon for Flexport in 2022. Clark joined Flexport to bring what he had built at Amazon to "small businesses and other businesses around the world." He left the startup feeling there was still a gap in the market for supply chain tools, and began to develop the idea behind Auger. The name is meant to convey the drilling tool's ability to break through things and dive deep. "I spent the last year with the chance to really sort of step back and think about the best way to tackle this problem," Clark said. "What do I want to do next? Do I still want to try to tackle this problem? Do I want to do something else? And I just kept coming back to, this should not be a problem for companies with the technology that exists in the world." He said a typical company might have "eight to 10 to 12 to 20" systems for procurement, forecasting, and enterprise resource planning. The systems can be clunky and are rarely integrated. He wanted to build a platform where companies could manage their supply chain with the "same level of simplicity and intuitiveness as the consumer applications that they use every day." Clark, who moved with his family to Texas before leaving Amazon, has returned to his former employer's backyard in Seattle to work on the new venture, which will be based in Bellevue, Washington. He hopes to pull from the area's deep bench of tech talent. Amazon last year rolled out its own supply chain management platform, which can handle the process of transporting businesses' goods from the manufacturer to customers' doorsteps. But the service is targeted at businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and use its logistics and fulfillment network. Auger's launch comes as venture deal volume has steadily declined over the past few years, aside from investments in artificial intelligence companies. U.S. venture capital exit value this year is expected to reach $98 billion, down 86% from 2021, according to an Aug. 29 report from PitchBook, while venture-backed IPOs are expected to be at their lowest since 2016. VC activity in the supply chain tech industry has shown recent improvement, although it's well below the levels seen in 2021 and 2022.

Title: Spotify’s HR chief says remote staff aren’t ‘children’ as company reaffirms work-from-anywhere policy

Amid a raft of return-to-office mandates from tech giants, including Amazon and iPhone challenger Nothing, Spotify sees no need to treat its staff like “children” and end its popular work-from-home policy. Spotify went through an overhaul last year, laying off 17% of its staff in December in a move CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged had a larger impact on operations than the company had anticipated. The decision has helped almost double Spotify’s market value this year, as the group notched record quarterly revenues while cutting costs. However, inside Spotify, the layoffs have shaken morale. For those who survived the cull, there isn’t likely to be a further morale-sapping plan to break with Spotify’s popular “work from anywhere” policy. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grownups and then treat them like children,” Spotify’s chief human resources officer Katarina Berg told Raconteur, explaining the group’s continued flexible work location policy. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom? “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” In February 2021, Spotify joined several other tech groups in allowing its employees to “work from anywhere.” This enabled employees to choose where and how they worked, provided the company had an office in that jurisdiction. Unlike other companies that have trickled employees back in on a hybrid basis, like Meta, or gone all-out and demanded a full return to the office, like Amazon, Spotify hasn’t chosen to renege on this policy. A big reason is likely the effect it has had on retention. Spotify said attrition rates were 15% lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2019. The company also said it had improved the diversity of its talent. While Spotify doesn’t intend to scrap its remote-working policy anytime soon, Berg acknowledged it wasn’t an ideal setup. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” Berg said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.” The company is still using innovative ways to encourage its music-loving staff to come into the office, including hosting “listening lounge” sessions featuring pop stars including Olivia Dean and Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. Staff are also strongly encouraged to come into the office during Spotify’s “core week” to reconnect and discuss strategy. Spotify’s biggest-ever round of layoffs last December, when it said goodbye to 1,500 staff, came as CEO Ek said the company was doing too much “work around the work.” The impact of those layoffs on operations was bigger than Ek expected, with Berg explaining to Raconteur that remaining staffers were left in a “state of shock” by the cull. “Spotify had been in hypergrowth, and this was the only thing people knew,” she said. “A lot of people at Spotify had never seen a recession, and it was a lot to absorb and digest.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Those hoping the mass layoffs among Big Tech companies were finally ending are in for a disappointment, with a new report predicting Amazon is on the verge of cutting nearly 14,000 manager roles. According to Morgan Stanley, via TechCrunch’s Manish Singh, Morgan Stanley says Amazon will reduce its manager headcount by 13,834 by the end of the Q1 2025.

More recently, the company has rolled out a controversial five-day-a-week RTO mandate, which some believe to be an effort to thin the company’s ranks and trim unneeded roles. Some employees have already voiced their opposition to the RTO mandate, with some saying they have no intention of complying, often because they were hired during the pandemic, assured remote work would continue, and live outside commuting range of any corporate office. It’s unclear at this time if Amazon will primarily target these individuals, or if the layoffs will have a wider scope.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's work-from-office mandate aims to help new recruits learn company work culture

Amazon Inc Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy's decision to bring back employees to the office full-time shows the executive's concern that new recruits don't understand the company culture, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Monday, October 7. Last month, Jassy surprised the employees with a memo instructing them to start coming to the office five days a week from January. Amazon currently lets many employees work from home two days a week, as per the report. The order stunned many of Amazon's more than 350,000 employees and restarted a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. They wonder if this was Jassy’s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. The CEO expressed his intention to reduce management layers in efforts to reduce bureaucracy, which, according to him, was slowing down Amazon, as per the agency report. The senior leadership made the part change, as they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people aware of the development cited by the agency. Jassy mentioned the word “culture” a dozen times in his memo. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” he wrote. “You have to work at it all the time,” according to the report. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser refused to comment beyond the CEO's memo, as per the report. Amazon, which sees itself as operating like a startup, has long acknowledged that its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid deck slides. According to the report, there’s a strong preference for analysis of data and trends and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate. Amazon is also famous for its tough environment and aggressive deadlines, as employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, according to founder Jeff Bezos who put it to the company's first recruits. According to the CEO's colleagues, Jassy who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches. After succeeding Bezos three years ago, he’s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he explains each of Amazon’s leadership principles, said the report. Amazon doubled its headcount and reduced the requirement for recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Company executives have been openly saying that fresh grads, new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company's culture which cannot be effectively conveyed through videoconferences or chat windows. “Culture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,” said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, at a press event last week. “And that’s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you’re over a video call,” according to the agency report. Keeping in mind the new schedule would be controversial, senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people aware of the development. The company denied the policy was designed to push employees out, according to the report. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider, in internal surveys. Some of the employees have already resigned and others are seeking work in other places. The last time the company ordered its employees to come back to the office for work, employees walked out at the company's Seattle headquarters, as per the report. It is unclear whether the employees will make a similar attempt again. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Bose Reinvented Itself Just in Time. Now Comes the Tricky Part

Bose might have turned 60, but the audio company seems to be firmly settling into its graduate school era. After late founder Amar Bose donated majority ownership to MIT in 2011—a little-known fact—it became higher-ed’s most valuable audio brand, and broadened its focus. Gone are the days of wired speakers, or a few paltry headphone options to pair with your stylish Bose Wave CD radio. In the past four years with CEO Lila Snyder—a former 15-year McKinsey consultant who is herself an MIT graduate with a master’s in mechanical engineering—Bose has seemingly righted a ship that appeared to be banking toward shore. Snyder and her team grabbed the helm after Bose shuttered its retail stores in the middle of a global pandemic. She also helped turn a rickety start in the wireless earbud and Bluetooth speaker space into some of the sleekest, best-sounding models on the market. In a world where management consultants and tech executives are known for stripping companies for parts and raising prices, Snyder and a slimmed-down Bose have maintained the brand’s noise-canceling superiority in the face of stiff competition from Apple, Sony, and others. What impresses me most about the Bose of 2024 is that it doesn’t have to play to the trends that publicly traded brands do: It has been an innovator for six decades, and it continues to be in everything from product development to retail strategy. It has quietly been deciphering the tricks behind in-car noise cancelation and beam-forming glasses, and has been developing personal line array systems for small-venue musicians. Ten years ago, I'd tell folks that beyond its excellent noise canceling, Bose offered very little for most people. Now? I’d say the company is getting dangerously close to eating Sonos’ lunch. Bose’s boxy new Smart Soundbar can pair with its Ultra Open earbuds for immersive sound in a small space. There are very few brands that have pushed personal audio technology so far forward in the past six decades. From vinyl record players to CDs, and now the streaming and portable listening era, Bose has made competitive products for higher-end listeners, even though it made a few missteps along the way—a few absolutely huge and uncomfortable pairs of early wireless earbuds, for example. It can be a surreal culture to join, Snyder says. The first female CEO of Bose, Snyder grew up a tinkerer who saved up for her first Bose radio. “I grew up with Bose as an aspirational brand, and an iconic one. And it's funny to join a company when you have stories from your background, right?” Still, even though Snyder no longer has to save up for access to the latest kit, apparently new hires and old get the same repetitive query from folks in their personal orbits. “Every Bose employee will tell you that the most common question they get is, ‘Do you get a discount?’” Snyder jokes. The company has always had premium prices, but in certain categories the products haven't always matched the brand's prestige: 2010s attempts at noise-canceling earbuds were bulky, sounded middling, and had poor battery life; and it also sold a line of too-expensive Bluetooth speakers with screens that nobody needed. Then, after its physical storefronts were not having the billboard-like effect Bose wanted, the brand, just prior to Snyder joining, decided to dramatically pivot—a word that can so often be replaced with “panic”—to a strategy that focused on online sales and bolstering exhibits in existing storefronts such as Best Buy in the United States. This seismic shift meant that every single Bose store in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan shuttered, resulting in 119 store closures and hundreds of layoffs worldwide. So far, under Snyder's stewardship, that swerve toward online and in-store retail has, according to the company, worked out—but it could have gone the other way. Brands like Nike that have pivoted away from brand-owned retail stores have seen sales dives, but the key difference lies in Bose's decision to lean into retail partners. By bolstering exhibits in places such as Best Buy and other stores, as well as leaning into sales on Amazon and other online retailers besides its own website, Bose has been able to maintain a broad reach while also not keeping retail overhead in-house. According to Snyder, this slimmed-down approach has been effective in righting Bose's fortunes, especially when paired with excellent new products. In being a tech company that entirely focuses on audio products, Snyder says that the secret sauce at Bose is research. Engineers are constantly looking for innovation in materials, acoustics, design, production, and more. When asked about recent innovations in solid-state driver technology, for example, she isn’t shy about its prodigious market research. “What's interesting about Bose is we have been an audio company for 60 years,” says Synder. “We know we're going to be in competitive markets. We've always been in competitive markets, whether that's headphones, or in the home, or in the car. What makes us different is we're all about audio. You can be assured we experiment with everything. When we believe something’s ready, we bring it forward. We’re always looking for technology that can change the game.” This is particularly evident when it comes to noise canceling, which was pioneered by the brand for aviators—a market Snyder says Bose is proud to remain dominant in—rather than folks in the main cabin of the plane. By investigating what pilots needed to operate safely and comfortably in the cockpit, and constantly asking them for improvements and ideas, Bose was able to develop and trickle down what remain the best noise-canceling algorithms WIRED has ever tested. That makes sense, given that latest generation of Bose Quietcomfort over-ears and earbuds offer genuine professional-grade aerospace technology. Snyder says the brand uses professionals, or semi-professinals in the case of its PA gear for small-venue musicians, not only to improve its products but also to market to folks who are interested in higher-end audio. “They're a professional musician. They have a great ear. They know what great sound sounds like. Those products create a sort of halo.” However, a significant marketing tool Bose used for considerable time was NFL games, where it was the sideline sponsor for headsets for eight years, ending the partnership early this decade. The partnership has since been taken over by Sony. Bose CEO Lila Snyder at Bose headquarters Snyder with Bose’s latest over-ear headphones The other problems Bose faces are ones that top-tier makers in all industries suffer from: It must keep innovating to maintain its place atop the mountain of noise canceling; and it must continue to make other products, such as speakers and soundbars, that do the same. Current projects that excite Synder include the company’s developing work in car audio, aiming to help reduce the road noise in cars that’s even more apparent in the quieter electric vehicle era. “We have been, and we'll continue to be, everywhere that music is important to our customers,” Synder says, not-so-subtly hinting at new tech to come. “We're excited about what we're about ready to bring to the market.” In the weeks since our conversation, Bose has announced a new affordable pair of noise-canceling earbuds that have gotten rave early reviews (our review is forthcoming), as well as a new soundbar option that features an AI-based dialog mode. Bose also announced that you can pair its Ultra Open earbuds to the soundbar to use them as faux-rear speakers in surround sound—just the type of genre-bending listening she was alluding to. We expect to see more innovation and are keen to see what happens when Bose combines its beam-forming audio tech we've seen in its Frame sunglasses, and the noise-canceling and personal audio experiences it has been testing for the car. As has been true for much of its six decades, I have a feeling the best of Bose is yet to come.
