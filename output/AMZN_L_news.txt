Title: Vice Bosses Talk Next Steps Following Bankruptcy And Tease New Production Finance Facility That Will Make It A ‚ÄúOne-Stop Studio Shop‚Äù

By Diana Lodderhose International Features Editor EXCLUSIVE: This year has seen a swath of global production and distribution entities in film and television impacted by layoffs and cuts, and Vice Media Group has been no exception. Following the company‚Äôs much-publicized bankruptcy in 2022, when it was sold for $350 million to hedge fund and former investor Fortress, the group underwent a raft of layoffs and restructuring earlier this year, with its production business, Vice Studios Group, now being led by Jamie Hall in London and Danny Gabai in Los Angeles. But Hollywood loves a comeback, and Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon tells Deadline in a rare interview that Vice is back from the brink in a smaller capacity but with a clear vision and money to spend ‚Äî the latter in the form of an imminent production finance facility, which it hopes to launch before the year end. Watch on Deadline ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt that the business is far healthier than it was a year ago,‚Äù says Dixon. ‚ÄúOne of the things I want to focus on is obviously culture and morale ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tough industry to be in at the moment but we‚Äôre feeling positive because we have become a far more agile company.‚Äù The Vice chief says he expects the company to be in profit in Q1 2025. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre smaller, we take opportunities where we can now and, more importantly, we‚Äôre backed by our investors and our board in terms of looking for opportunities for growth and exciting projects.‚Äù Today, the company is operating at 30% of its size compared to the beginning of the year. Dixon says this leaner operation ‚Äì and particularly its global production entity Vice Studios Group, which is behind projects such as Gangs of London, the Saoirse Ronan feature film Bad Apples, Netflix doc Lewis Capaldi: How I‚Äôm Feeling Now and upcoming hybrid musical/doc Pavements ‚Äì means it can better adapt to the changing market. Key to this, Dixon says, will be the introduction of a production finance facility, which it is currently at the ‚Äúadvanced stages‚Äù of securing. The London-based exec says he was recently in LA working on securing the production facility which will, he says, help propel the company‚Äôs strategy to move its studio business into a ‚Äúmore IP-based‚Äù content business and will enable it to be a ‚Äúone-stop studio shop.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe were forced to be a camera for hire for so long and that had more to do with our corporate resources than anything else,‚Äù says Dixon. ‚ÄúSo, being able to break through what we went through in a much-publicized bankruptcy, we‚Äôre now focusing on the positives of being in the content business.‚Äù He continues: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre recognizing that we‚Äôve always had that skillset, but we‚Äôve just never had the financial capability to go out and be the super studio ‚Äì which we have all the skills for, but we‚Äôve never been able to put something up front on projects and get involved at earlier stages. That‚Äôs somewhat hindered us. It hasn‚Äôt hindered our creativity, but it‚Äôs hindered our output and our ability to improve margins and be a more successful financial business.‚Äù Vice Studios Group co-president Gabai notes that with streaming services and many premium cablers ‚Äúmoving away from a world where they do all-rights buyouts,‚Äù the introduction of a facility will better enable Vice to compete on a global scale for content via co-financing agreements or co-productions. ‚ÄúWe do so much global production in the UK and other territories that, for us, it feels like there are more opportunities for windowing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an opportunity for a studio player out there who can really step into that role and fill the gap on productions that may be launching out of the UK, or other territories, and we can give them that extra piece of resource that they would need to go into production.‚Äù While Dixon couldn‚Äôt reveal any more details about numbers or timing on the finance facility, he did indicate that he was hopeful it will launch ‚Äúbefore the end of the year.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that is a priority for us and we hope to close it soon,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut it will allow us to have more possibilities as a company and allows us to be a little more opportunistic in our ideas, while also bringing more certainty around the projects we are doing.‚Äù Vice Media Group, which moved out of the online news game earlier this year, has trimmed down to focus on its Virtue ad agency and Vice TV, a joint venture with A&E, in addition to its studio business. Meanwhile, Vice Digital, a culture hub publishing content on and around Vice‚Äôs platforms, which Dixon notes was a ‚Äúmassive financial burden for us,‚Äù has since relaunched under a new joint venture with Nashville-based Savage Ventures. In the company‚Äôs tumultuous 18 months, one bright spot has been its global production business Vice Studios Group, which has a distribution catalogue of more than 1,000 hours and oversees five premium production entities: Pulse Films, UnTypical, Vice Studios LatAm, Vice Studios Canada and a news documentary unit. By the end of 2024, the group expects to have produced 21 projects including Pulse Films-produced Pavements, from director Alex Ross Perry, and Sky Original and Pulse Films series Atomic, starring Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif, the latter of which wrapped in Morocco last summer. The company is currently shooting the third season of British crime drama Gangs of London (seasons 1 & 2 launched on Netflix in September as part of a wide-ranging deal with AMC Networks) and also premiered Jason Pollard-directed doc Ol‚ÄôDirty Bastard: A Tale of Two Dirtys at the UK‚Äôs Doc‚Äôn Roll Film Festival. Vice Studios and Viral Nation recently announced the development of unscripted series Montana Boyz (working title), about TikTok cowboys Kaleb Winterbrun, Mark Estes and Kade Wilcox. ‚ÄúThis will be the largest production year we‚Äôve ever had, which is crazy when we are coming out of a bankruptcy,‚Äù says Gabai. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had this happen with all of the headwinds going on around us and a really tough marketplace, but now those headwinds are behind us.‚Äù Gabai notes that he and fellow Co-President Hall had previously restructured the studio business when Vice Studios and Pulse merged a few years prior to the bankruptcy. ‚ÄúI think, to some extent, the studio has been operating with the benefit of a very tightly knit group of people for a couple of years,‚Äù he says. The manifesto for the studios business is to focus on director-driven talent: ‚ÄúWe tend to work with really great filmmakers and, oftentimes, if they‚Äôre not already huge household names when we start working with them, they tend to grow into big names off the back of doing projects with us.‚Äù This year, Vice reunited with its Fyre documentary director Chris Smith for Devo, a doc about the band of the same name which launched in Sundance earlier this year. It is also producing Hollywood Ending, from Tiger King director Rebecca Chaiklin, via its UnTypical strand, which follows the downfall of Zach Horwitz, the charismatic ‚Äúmidwestern, millennial Madoff‚Äù who ran a $690M Ponzi scheme under the noses of those closest to him. The latter was picked up by Amazon MGM. ‚ÄúI used to say in my agent days that talented people are always talented,‚Äù says Gabai. ‚ÄúWhether somebody‚Äôs having a hot moment or a cold moment or they‚Äôre making a million things at once, or they haven‚Äôt worked for a couple of years ‚Äì if someone is really talented and attacks their projects in an interesting way, that‚Äôs somebody we want to bet on.‚Äù It was this vision that ultimately led Vice Studios to bringing aboard Listen Up Philip director Ross Perry to helm Pavements, a documentary/fiction hybrid about the venerable U.S. indie rock band Pavement fronted by Stephen Malkmus. Pavement is best known for songs such as ‚ÄúCut Your Hair‚Äù and ‚ÄúStereo,‚Äù which they released through Matador Records. The Pulse Films-produced project, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and is having its UK premiere at the London Film Festival today, intimately shows the band preparing for their sold-out 2022 reunion tour, while simultaneously taking the audience behind the scenes of the making of a musical, a museum and a spoof Hollywood biopic, featuring Jason Schwarzman as Matador Records founder Chris Lombardi and Joe Keery as Malkmus. Matador Records and Pavement were keen to do something ‚Äútotally different‚Äù says Gabai, and he says that ‚Äúthis felt like a good opportunity to take the piss out of a standard music documentary.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlex was the top director on my list and Stephen seems like the character that Alex would have written about and created,‚Äù says Gabai. For Ross Perry, he was drawn to the ‚Äúbig, structural conceit of the film: ‚ÄúI just thought this movie should take place in a world where Pavement are as worthy of every form of tribute as say, the Rolling Stones, The Beatles or David Bowie because, for a few 100,000 people, that‚Äôs true,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn the spirit of the band, we wanted to put this whole endeavor in quotation marks, in the way they put the idea of being a successful band in quotations.‚Äù Pavements, says Gabai, is a prime example of the kinds of projects Vice Studios will aim to back going forward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always filmmaker first for us. Everything we do is driven by the filmmaker or the showrunner or the core creative on any project, what they want to do with the material on that project and what they want to say about this crazy world that we live in while doing it in a way that is fun and entertaining.‚Äù Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: From Tariffs to Taxes to Tyranny, Hollywood Braces for the Possibility of a Donald Trump Victory

Director Ali Abbasi basked in the applause, confident that the eight-minute standing ovation ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù was enjoying in Cannes last May meant that his six-year gamble to bring the film to the screen was about to pay off. The movie, a look at Donald Trump‚Äôs early years as a real estate developer and his friendship with Roy Cohn, was scouting for distribution. Armed with this kind of reception, Abbasi believed he would soon have Netflix, or one of the prominent indie studios, knocking on his door. But though ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù drew interest from the usual suspects, there were no offers ‚Äî not even a lowball one. The film, which depicts Trump getting liposuction, abusing amphetamines, running his casino into the ground and raping his first wife, Ivana, was simply too hot to handle. With Trump locked in a tight race for the White House, major studios, indie labels and streamers, or at least their corporate parents, couldn‚Äôt risk alienating the once and possibly future king. Related Stories VIP+ The Talent Compensation Question Hanging Over Netflix Earnings Box Office: 'The Wild Robot' Powering Up to $35 Million Opening, 'Megalopolis' on Track for Less Than $5 Million ‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù Abbasi says. ‚ÄúThis guy can become the next president, and he will have all these tools at his disposal, which he‚Äôs shown a willingness to use. So he can come after you with all these regulations and taxes.‚Äù he adds, ‚ÄúBut it still upsets me.‚Äù Popular on Variety Abbasi‚Äôs experience says a lot about the anxiety gripping the entertainment world as it watches a tumultuous, enormously consequential election unfold. From corporate suites to studio lots, Hollywood is bracing for a possible Trump return, one that could bring chaos and deepen political divisions in a polarized country. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of nervousness,‚Äù says Schuyler M. Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker, who practices entertainment, corporate and tax law. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know exactly what he would do if he got back in power.‚Äù The actors, writers and directors who make most of what Hollywood exports are overwhelmingly supportive of Kamala Harris and view Trump as an existential threat to their freedoms. They speak at rallies for the Democratic nominee, host fundraisers and make personal contributions. And they‚Äôre terrified about what Trump would mean for everything from abortion access to environmental protections ‚Äî to say nothing of the frontal assault on the rule of law he seems hell-bent on waging. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs at stake,‚Äù says Sarah Paulson, the Emmy- and Tony-winning actress and a Harris supporter. ‚ÄúDemocracy is on the ballot.‚Äù But the people who sign Paulson and other artists‚Äô checks have complicated loyalties ‚Äî they seem more worried about making money than maintaining democratic norms. For them, a second Trump term would mean lower taxes and less antitrust enforcement, a key attraction for a debt-ridden industry looking to consolidate. They are banking on Trump behaving like a generic Republican by embracing a pro-business agenda. But Trump has been less interested in ideology and more attracted to a politics of personal grievance, one that rewards sycophants and punishes critics. Trump‚Äôs erratic behavior in his first term made it difficult for companies to figure out how to navigate his administration without offending him. Despite that challenge, his policies were often good for corporate bottom lines. In 2017, Trump signed a massive tax cut, lowering corporate rates from 35% to 21%. The bill included benefits that were especially helpful to Hollywood, including a lowered rate on overseas income and the ability to immediately write off the full cost of film and TV productions. Disney and Comcast each saved more than $6 billion in the following four years, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. If elected to a second term, Trump has vowed to cut the corporate rate even further ‚Äî to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. Harris, in contrast, wants to hike the rate to 28% and increase the tax on overseas income. Regardless of who wins, the Motion Picture Association, which represents seven Hollywood studios, is already seeking to influence the next tax law. In a Sept. 25 letter, the lobbying group urged Congress to preserve the benefits of the Trump tax cut, arguing that it ‚Äúled to a profound increase in film and television production and ownership in the U.S.‚Äù On the other hand, Trump has targeted companies that own news operations, sometimes in performative ways, but sometimes with genuine consequences. In the last month, he has threatened to pull the broadcast licenses of CBS and Disney‚Äôs ABC over their coverage, and he is currently suing ABC. He has threatened to investigate Comcast for ‚Äútreason‚Äù over NBC‚Äôs coverage of the Russia scandal. And in 2017, his Justice Department sued to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, which some saw as retaliation against CNN for its coverage of his campaign and presidency. Looking ahead, Trump has pledged to use his office to prosecute opponents. Since many media conglomerates operate news divisions and produce late-night shows that investigate, criticize or lampoon Trump, that could make them a legal and political target for a president obsessed with personal retribution. ‚ÄúI could see him asking Republicans to pass a law saying anything anti-government is treasonous,‚Äù says Moore. ‚ÄúAnd I could also see him trying to upend current defamation law, so it becomes much easier to go after people. That could have a chilling effect on free speech.‚Äù Moore faults companies for being too enamored of the tax cuts that Trump is proposing and insufficiently fearful of his authoritarian impulses. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not kidding around,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how great it would be for them to live in a country without a functional democracy.‚Äù Those darker predictions may not come to pass, but whoever wins the Oval Office will have to deal with a media industry that‚Äôs desperate to keep merging. And since the next president‚Äôs administration will be tasked with enforcing antitrust law, that will give either Trump or Harris enormous power over Hollywood‚Äôs future. The Biden administration has antagonized Wall Street by appointing enforcers ‚Äî Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, anti-trust division chief at the Justice Department ‚Äî who have targeted corporate power, especially in tech. Critics argue that has had a chilling effect. ‚ÄúThey created an environment that made dealmaking more difficult,‚Äù says Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve scared away deals.‚Äù It‚Äôs not obvious which administration would be better for companies. Kovacic assumes that Trump would back off on the Biden approach, though he adds, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre a company he hates, he‚Äôs not beyond revenge.‚Äù Harris, meanwhile, sued several companies on antitrust grounds when she was California attorney general. But she was reluctant to take big swings at the tech industry, according to a memoir by Kathleen Foote, the longtime chief of the AG‚Äôs antitrust section. Kovacic says Harris might go a little easier than Biden, but in a subtle way, so as not to rile her left flank. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently urged the Justice Department to scrutinize Venu, the new sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, saying it would raise subscription prices across the industry. If Harris is elected, Sanders and Warren are likely to keep up the pressure on her administration on that and similar issues. Warner Bros. Discovery is struggling under a massive debt load, and another merger may be its only means of survival. At the Allen & Co. conference in July, CEO David Zaslav didn‚Äôt endorse a candidate, but said he hoped the next administration will see the benefits of consolidation. ‚ÄúWe just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,‚Äù he said. The Hollywood unions have supported the Biden approach, arguing that media consolidation suppresses wages and results in layoffs. ‚ÄúThe Biden administration has been the most pro-labor administration we‚Äôve seen in our lifetimes,‚Äù says Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 65,000 Hollywood workers and has endorsed Harris. ‚ÄúIt was an easy call for us,‚Äù Loeb says. Entertainment companies also face the risk of an all-out trade war. Hollywood is an export business, but many studios belong to companies such as Sony and Apple that also import electronics and other goods to the U.S. Trump has promised a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods coming from China. That would unleash ‚Äúchaos‚Äù in a global marketplace, says Ed Brzytwa, the VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. ‚ÄúAll the agreements, rules and norms will start to unravel,‚Äù he says. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, most of which Biden retained. They amounted to a $32 billion levy on electronic goods through 2021, according to Brzytwa‚Äôs group. The Consumer Technology Association ‚Äî whose members include Sony, Disney, Amazon and Comcast ‚Äî argues that the tariffs failed to revive U.S. manufacturing, but did push production to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and Taiwan. In 2022, Sony Electronics moved much of its camera production to Thailand. Harris would likely maintain the Biden approach, using targeted tariffs more aggressively than under previous Democratic administrations. Trump‚Äôs overall tariff rates would be seven times higher than the current level, according to the Tax Foundation. If he follows through, prices would rise, and the resulting drop in demand, for many companies, would outweigh any gains from lower tax rates, Brzytwa says. ‚ÄúI think there is a lot of interest in the corporate world in preserving what was accomplished in the [Trump tax bill],‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut they don‚Äôt want a situation where the U.S. is a fortress and is closed off from the world.‚Äù Brzytwa warns that other countries would likely retaliate, making life more difficult for exporters ‚Äî even entertainment producers. Media giants shoot all over the world, taking advantage of foreign subsidies. They employ creative talent overseas, and release movies and television shows to vast international regions, where they hope to drive future growth. Trump‚Äôs protectionist policies could disrupt that. They would threaten to reframe America‚Äôs role in the global economy, straining alliances and fracturing trade partnerships. The consequences of those actions would be felt in almost every sector of the economy. ‚ÄúYou have someone in Trump with the potential to blow it all up,‚Äù says Tina Fordham, the founder of Fordham Global Foresight and an expert on geopolitical risk. ‚ÄúIf the rules of the game and international norms aren‚Äôt respected, then the U.S. will no longer be treated as a reliable global trading partner. That means all the advantages that America has enjoyed in the post-World War II era could erode. I‚Äôm not sure people appreciate how destabilizing this could be.‚Äù Some of that impact is already being felt. A decade ago, Hollywood was still focused on opening the Chinese market to American films. But that initiative faded away as the relationship soured. ‚ÄúThat ship has sailed,‚Äù says Greg Frazier, who worked on the issue while at the MPA. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs Harris or Trump, I don‚Äôt see any great opening in China, on either side.‚Äù As for ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù after months in limbo, the producers finally signed a deal with Briarcliff Entertainment, a tiny distribution company that has handled politically charged fare such as ‚ÄúThe Dissident,‚Äù a 2020 documentary about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that also scared off major media outlets. ‚ÄúIt was such a relief to get into theaters,‚Äù Abbasi says. ‚ÄúI spent the summer clinically depressed and thinking, ‚ÄòWe did all this work, and nobody is ever going to see our film.‚Äô‚Äù Instead, ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù opened in theaters on Oct. 11, a month before a presidential election that could return Trump to the pinnacle of power. Abbasi is glad that someone had the courage to release his movie, but he won‚Äôt forget the fear he encountered while trying to get ‚ÄúThe Apprentice‚Äù in front of audiences. ‚ÄúThe big story for me is how one human being is intimidating the 300 million or so people who live in America,‚Äù Abbasi says. ‚ÄúHow can an entire country let that happen?‚Äù Jack Dunn contributed to this report.

Title: Walmart‚Äôs CTO places bigger bets on generative AI as customer shopping habits evolve

Over a few decades, consumers have moved from shopping exclusively in brick-and-mortar stores, to online, and more recently to spending billions annually through mobile apps. Now, consumers are changing their shopping habits again. Walmart calls the new reality ‚Äúadaptive retail,‚Äù which is more about personalized shopping, an expectation that retailers will anticipate what consumers want before they decide themselves, and shoppers buying specific products based on what they see influencers pitching on social media. This evolution of consumer thinking has led Walmart to invest in newer technologies, including generative artificial intelligence. ‚ÄúShopping is not just a blend of core retail and e-commerce,‚Äù says Hari Vasudev, executive vice president and chief technology officer of Walmart U.S. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a much more fluid experience.‚Äù As Walmart sees it, online shopping has been narrowly focused. Consumers would enter a few search terms to find the exact television or jeans they were looking for. Online retailers were tasked with selling goods at a desirable price and offering efficient and speedy delivery. But shoppers are getting more loquacious. They‚Äôre asking more detailed questions about products, and they want to use new tools, including 3D that can visualize furniture in their home, for example. According to Walmart, they also increasingly want to shop with the help of virtual reality to see what clothes they want to buy look like. Meanwhile, social channels like TikTok and live streaming services including Twitch provide inspiration for shopping. ‚ÄúThe search bar is no longer the way to shop,‚Äù says Vasudev. That‚Äôs led Walmart to pivot by announcing this month that it‚Äôs starting to use predictive models and generative AI to offer a personalized version of walmart.com for every American shopper. The feature will fully roll out by the end of next year. ‚ÄúThe way we‚Äôre thinking about applying AI and generative AI is to offer highly curated experiences and content,‚Äù says Vasudev. The goal is to create a personalized experience for each shopper based on what they‚Äôve bought previously or searched for online, matched with what‚Äôs been a strong seller for Walmart or trending on social. Location and time of year would also factor in. A shopper who‚Äôs previously bought goods for their dog will be shown pet costumes for Halloween. Customers in Minnesota and Arkansas will be marketed new sweaters at different points in the season, based on when winter hits. Walmart‚Äôs generative AI efforts have thus far focused on five areas: the customer shopping experience, improving how in-store associates do their work, operational areas like supply chain and merchandising, content generation, and making software developers more productive. AI-focused tools Walmart has launched in the last few years to help employees save time have included ‚ÄúAsk Sam,‚Äù which lets associates ask questions like where to find a specific item in a store, and MyAssistant, a tool for corporate employees that can summarize large documents and write drafts. In most instances, Walmart is favoring ‚Äúbuild‚Äù over ‚Äúbuy‚Äù when it comes to generative AI. The company centralized machine learning capabilities in a proprietary platform, called Element, so tech staff could experiment with AI models without having to worry if they would fit into a specific vendor or cloud provider. Walmart is using a blend of in-house large language models, proprietary offerings from OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Gemini, and open-source models. This month, Walmart also unveiled a generative AI-powered customer support assistant that relies on retail-specific large language models. The generative AI, Walmart says, will enable the chatbot to anticipate customer questions and offer more proactive solutions for handling returns, exchanges, and other problems that may arise. And in some cases, the new AI agents are proving to be twice as fast as the humans, according to Vasudev. Throughout the development process, Walmart says finding the right conversational tone was critical. ‚ÄúWhen we have something like a chat experience, you want to make sure that the quality of the conversation feels empathetic and feels very genuine,‚Äù says Vasudev. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Adobe gets more creative on AI pricing. Adobe says the company‚Äôs new video-generating AI product will be priced differently than other AI tools, with CEO Shantanu Narayen acknowledging that the cost to produce video is ‚Äúa little bit more expensive.‚Äù It's the latest indication that tech firms are tinkering with their approach to pricing while also racing to develop and launch new AI products. Bloomberg reports that until now, Adobe hasn't charged for the use of the software company‚Äôs AI features beyond standard subscription fees. And while users are allotted certain credits for using AI, Adobe isn‚Äôt enforcing those limits for most plans. Amazon, Databricks ink AI chips deal. Amazon.com and Databricks have agreed to a five-year deal that will let the startup use Amazon‚Äôs Trainium AI chips to power a service that would let companies customize an AI model, or even build their own. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal will let Amazon continue to position itself as a neutral provider of AI technology, while Databricks makes money from cloud-based AI software and other services from companies building their technology tools. Databricks and Amazon already work together, as Amazon Web Services is one of Databricks‚Äô cloud partners, and Databricks also rents Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units through AWS. TikTok, Boeing announce layoffs for very different reasons. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, said the social media platform is laying off 500 employees, most of whom moderated content on the service. TikTok says that 80% of content that violates the company‚Äôs guidelines is already removed by automated technologies, but the latest cut is an even greater shift to using AI for content policing. Separately, Boeing is cutting 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 employees. The aerospace company also announced it would end production in 2027 of the 767 freighter, which has faced setbacks for years related to questions about the company‚Äôs quality control and safety precautions. Tesla‚Äôs robotics and AI event disappoints; CIO departs. Tesla‚Äôs Cybercab event, aimed at persuading investors that the electric vehicle maker is also a leader in AI and robotics, failed to impress Wall Street. Much of the criticism fell on CEO Elon Musk for failing to share any specifics about the timeline or operational rollout of the self-driving Cybercab. Meanwhile, Bloomberg and other outlets reported that humans were remotely controlling some capabilities of the Optimus robot prototypes that had initially made a splash online when they were unveiled last week. Ahead of the event, Bloomberg also reported that Nagesh Saldi, Tesla‚Äôs chief information officer, is leaving the company. Saldi had reported directly to Musk and had been involved in building out new data centers in Texas and New York. Increased efficiency is a top genAI aspiration. Executives surveyed by MIT Technology Review Insights, along with business technology provider Snowflake, found that 72% were prioritizing increased efficiency and productivity from their generative AI efforts, far exceeding their hope for increased revenue (30%) or reducing costs (24%). Increased market competitiveness ranked second at 55% in the survey, and product and services innovations and improved customer satisfaction were also seen as more valuable than boosting the top line or trimming expenses. The poll of around 275 business leaders also found that 53% say their data foundations were ‚Äúsomewhat ready‚Äù for gen AI, meaning their data has been properly gathered, aggregated, stored, and is accessible to support generative AI applications. Twenty-two percent were more confident, saying their data foundations are ‚Äúvery ready.‚Äù The remaining 25% felt either ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù or ‚Äúvery‚Äù unready.

Bengaluru: During the long hours of pandemic-induced lockdown, some of his friends picked up mobile gaming while others discovered short videos on YouTube and Instagram. But for Rohit Agarwal, a garment shop owner from Tumsar, a town in north-west Maharashtra, it was reading a college love story that sparked a new passion. Within weeks, Agarwal found himself spending hours every day engrossed in reading long-form fiction on Pratilipi, a digital storytelling platform. ‚ÄúThere were days when I‚Äôd start a book post lunch and finish it by midnight," he recalls. New to reading, Agarwal was surprised to discover the addictive joy in captivating stories and the fictional world of romance and love stories. Soon, Agarwal took a plunge and decided to publish his own stories on the platform, a transition quite common on Pratilipi which has an active community of 1.5 million writers and 6.5 million monthly readers. The startup is a user-generated content platform that allows authors to publish their long-form content in multiple Indian languages. Founded in 2014 and backed by investors like Tencent, Nexus Ventures and Alteria Capital, Pratilipi recently reached a milestone of being cash-flow positive in July 2024. Pratilipi‚Äôs revenue in 2023-24 rose by 66% to ‚Çπ58 crore, from ‚Çπ35 crore the year before.The net loss narrowed by 62% to ‚Çπ58 crore last year. Overall, the company has raised $80 million in funding over seven rounds. But the company cannot be measured by its finances alone. In the era of 15-second reels and waning attention spans, Pratilipi‚Äôs quest to foster a culture of reading long-form regional literature stands out in India‚Äôs content ecosystem‚Äîan ecosystem that has seen a massive rise and crash in the last half-decade. Several short video apps that emerged in the last few years tanked while some like Moj, Josh and MXtakatak saw mergers. Popular live-streaming apps disappeared after the China ban, while Koo, an Indian version of Twitter (now X), shut shop earlier this year citing a lack of funding or acquisition interest. While these platforms spent heavily on customer acquisition and creator rewards, some failed to take off and others are still struggling to retain users and build sustainable communities. One of the reasons for Pratilipi‚Äôs survival in tough market conditions has been its singular focus on long-form content. While other platforms tried to cash in on the market frenzy of multiple formats like short videos and bite-sized content, Pratilipi stuck to its core offering of in-depth, engaging stories in regional Indian languages. This focused effort has helped the platform build a loyal fanbase of millions of readers‚Äîprimarily women aged between 18-35 years. ‚ÄúLong-form storytelling will never go out of fashion," says Ranjeet Pratap Singh, founder of Pratilipi. Singh‚Äôs journey with Pratilipi is rooted in his conviction and confidence that good stories will always find consumers. That said, Pratilpi‚Äôs journey hasn‚Äôt always been smooth. Wattpad‚Äôs playbookBefore founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh‚Äôs batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders‚Äî Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan‚Äîwho left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures. In 2014, when Pratilipi launched, Wattpad, the Toronto-based self-publishing platform, was already recognized among the hottest digital media companies. A rage among teen girls, Wattpad, in its eighth year of running, had attained a cult-like status and began monetization in 2014 after reaching 25 million monthly active users. Borrowing several pages from Wattpad‚Äôs playbook, Singh says he knew this was a game of patience and execution. View Full Image A screenshot of the Wattpad reading app. ‚ÄúOur first major challenge was to build demand and supply‚Äîa classic chicken and egg problem," says Singh. Pratilipi chose to focus on fixing the supply side first. The company reached out to authors through various channels, imploring them to get published on the platform. Writers such as Abhidha Sharma and Jitendra Jeetu were approached. Despite being published, these authors were having difficulty reaching a wide readership. To build an initial content library, the company also picked up a few hundred Indian language titles that were available in the public domain. This strategy, aped from Wattpad‚Äôs playbook, helped the company get the initial traction and readers. Eventually, though, the platform had to prove its merit in the original content market. Singh recalls placing a great emphasis on prioritizing its writers and their experience on the platform. Pratilipi introduced initiatives such as workshops for new writers, fellowships for seasoned authors, author chat rooms and a feedback loop between readers and writers. ‚ÄúOne of our biggest initial platform challenges was supporting Indian languages," says Singh. Fortunately, the launch and adoption of the Google Indic keyboard took the load off a tech problem for the company. Pratilipi stories are currently available in 12 Indian languages, including Punjabi, Odia and Bengali. Malayalam and Marathi stories are read the most. View Full Image A screenshot from the Pratilipi app. The highest form of gratification for writers, though, comes from a large reader community. To fix this, the company aggressively marketed through Facebook ads. Authors were also encouraged to share their stories within their network. Community initiatives like chat rooms for authors helped build user retention. All these efforts made traditional book publishers sit up and take notice. ‚ÄúPratilipi‚Äôs success in enabling online reading habits has been an eye-opener, changing the perception of traditional publishers," says Gautam Padmanabhan, chief executive of Westland Books, a company Pratilipi acqui-hired in April 2022 after Amazon announced that it was shutting down the publishing house.Acqui-hire is the practice of buying a company to access employees and their skills.‚ÄúThis has forced us to rethink our approach to digital publishing," Padmanabhan added. Early investors, meanwhile, believed in the monetization potential of the platform. Nexus Ventures was one of them. Pratik Poddar, partner at the venture capital firm, explains that their initial investment was driven by the founders‚Äô passion for creating a literature-focused platform in India. However, the global trend of users paying for long-form content and the potential to monetize intellectual property, as seen in the West and China, solidified their decision to invest. Pay to readFor the longest time, the platform was free; authors weren‚Äôt paid. This changed in 2020 when Pratilipi introduced a premium app where subscriptions cost ‚Çπ150 a month or ‚Çπ1,500 a year. In addition, there is also a ‚ÄòSuperfan‚Äô subscription where readers can subscribe to specific authors for ‚Çπ25 a month or ‚Çπ250 a year. The app currently has 400,000 monthly paying users.Pratilipi authors now get paid based on engagement generated by paid users on the app, similar to Spotify. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model, where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and feedback. By default, writers own the intellectual property for any story they publish on the platform. However, the company also acquires a small number of stories that it feels can work across various formats such as audio and web series. Authors still retain a share of the revenue generated from these formats. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model,where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and allows authors to receive ongoing feedback on the plot twists and turns of their narratives. Shelja Shrivastava,who writes in Hindi, is among the top authors on Pratilipi. She recalls hiring an external editor to proofread and edit her story chapters. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt getting paid for my stories back then, but I was willing to spend on an editor because I didn‚Äôt want to publish a shoddy story," says Shrivastava, adding that user feedback was paramount to her. View Full Image A file photo of Shelja Shrivastava. A part-time professor and homeopathic doctor, Shrivastava, on good days writes anywhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words over a couple of hours and makes about ‚Çπ35,000 per month through the platform. When she is not as active, her earnings drop to ‚Çπ20,000 a month. Popular among the genre of social issues and romance, Shrivastava has built a community of 30,000 followers and 27 million impressions on the platform. Time to buy2020 was also when the company pressed the accelerator on diversification. Inorganic growth was in the offing. Pratilipi expanded into audiobooks and comics. That year, it acquired IVM Podcasts, a podcast platform. Pratilipi FM, the company‚Äôs audiobook platform, now has 170,000 monthly active listeners, while Pratilipi Comics, which offers digital comics in six Indian languages, has over 80,000 monthly active readers. The Westland acqui-hire, meanwhile, gave the company expertise in physical publishing. And Westland gained from the digital publishing expertise Pratilipi built over the years. Since the partnership, Westland has adaptedThe Habit Coach, a podcast on the platform, into a book. It also adapted Ruskin Bond‚ÄôsTales From My Heart into a comic book. Six months to liveFor Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses‚Äîthe runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company‚Äôs operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ‚Çπ41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ‚Çπ35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year‚Äîdown to ‚Çπ6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh. While the company‚Äôs operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ‚Çπ41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ‚Çπ35 crore. During this period, the revenue from Pratilipi‚Äôs literature segment remained strong, aiding the company to stay afloat and even grow. In January 2024, the literature segment became cash flow positive, marking a turning point. By July, Pratilipi achieved overall cash flow positivity. Nonetheless, Singh admits to making decisions that have hurt revenue growth. For instance, the Pratilipi app doesn‚Äôt have an erotica category‚Äîalthough there is plenty of romance‚Äîbecause many writers on the platform insisted on ‚Äúkeeping the platform family-friendly." The next chapterWhile erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books. Pratilipi wants to capitalize on this trend by expanding its intellectual property across various formats. This move positions them to better compete in the regional content market. The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ‚Çπ10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ‚Çπ20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi‚Äôs primary audience‚Äînon-English readers from smaller towns‚Äîare cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. ‚ÄúGreat stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. ‚ÄúOur competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." Before founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone.

Title: CVS and Walgreens are ailing. Here‚Äôs why
URL: https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:34:11Z
Full Content:
Alina Selyukh Walgreens said Tuesday it would close 1,200 stores. Rival drugstore chain CVS recently laid off thousands of employees to cut costs. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Not too long after Tim Wentworth became CEO of Walgreens, he revealed a stunning figure: Roughly a quarter of the pharmacy chain‚Äôs stores do not make money. On Tuesday, he said 1,200 of those stores will close over three years. That‚Äôs two weeks after rival CVS announced layoffs of 2,900 corporate staff. Both chains are on a multibillion-dollar cost-saving spree ‚Äî closing hundreds of locations, cutting thousands of jobs and, really, reconsidering their role in Americans‚Äô lives. The slow simmer of mistakes and misfortunes has come to a boil for the biggest U.S. drugstore chains. They‚Äôve accumulated too many stores at a time of changing shopper habits. They‚Äôre saddled with numerous government fines and a particularly ailing relationship with health insurers. CVS and Walgreens have some notable differences. Walgreens, which also owns the British drugstore Boots, is more singularly focused on its pharmacy business. CVS has expanded further into health care through mergers with insurer Aetna and Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager that helps insurers negotiate prescription drug coverage and costs. Yet the two companies have made similar missteps. The simplest part of the problem is scale. CVS and Walgreens grew massive nationwide footprints of more than 9,000 and 8,000 stores, respectively. They gobbled up mom-and-pop shops and signed long-term leases for prime locations on street corners. A chain with a padlock secures freezer doors at a San Francisco Walgreens store in July 2023. The store padlocked its freezers to thwart shoplifters who had been stealing frozen pizzas and ice cream. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Now, shoppers regularly complain about chronically understaffed stores, with products locked up to prevent theft. The shelves of snacks, makeup, greeting cards and cleaning products were meant to boost profits. But sales have sagged for years ‚Äî a result of a losing battle with Amazon, Walmart, Costco, grocery and dollar stores. CVS and Walgreens ‚Äúprobably do have too many stores because they overexpanded, but the bigger problem is that the stores that they have are not very good,‚Äù said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at the firm GlobalData. The chains have failed to add new incentives for shoppers, beyond photo booths and returns drop-off centers, says Anshuman Jaiswal, a longtime consultant to retailers and pharmacies. And neither chain has built a meaningful online presence designed to give customers what they need. ‚ÄúIf you go to CVS.com or Walgreens.com, if you are placing an order for cough syrup, why don't I sell chicken broth as a product recommendation immediately?‚Äù Jaiswal says. ‚ÄúIt's about reimagining the business model.‚Äù Given the retail struggles, pharmacies could perhaps simply ditch the convenience store and focus on selling medicine ‚Äî except CVS and Walgreens say it‚Äôs harder and harder to make a profit from this part of their business. Years ago, a big shift in the power balance between pharmacies and health insurers revealed the limits of drugstores‚Äô leverage. ‚ÄúHistorically, there was a view that there was a lot of customer loyalty to their specific retail pharmacy ‚Ä¶ and that patients, or consumers, would be all up in arms if they were forced to move their prescriptions,‚Äù says Brian Tanquilut, health care services analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. Walgreens tested this theory about a decade ago when it got into a public fight with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that worked with major health insurers. Walgreens and Express Scripts played a game of chicken over how much Walgreens should earn from prescriptions ‚Äî and Walgreens lost. For a time, it got kicked out of insurance networks used by millions of people, who simply went elsewhere to get their medicine at the lower in-network prices. ‚ÄúWhat that did was to prove that patient loyalty is not to the retail pharmacy, but it actually is whatever my insurance is willing to pay,‚Äù Tanquilut says. ‚ÄúAnd that opened the door for the payers to keep pushing pricing down on retail pharmacy chains.‚Äù These days, CVS and Walgreens are facing tough competition from pharmacies that don‚Äôt depend as much on profits from prescriptions because they‚Äôre part of retail giants, including Walmart and Costco. The drugstore chains also have spent millions of dollars on government fines over allegations of unsafe staffing levels, overbilling government insurance programs and contributing to the opioid epidemic. Over the years, CVS and Walgreens attempted to reframe themselves as health care hubs, expanding primary-care clinics. But these operations cost time and money. On Tuesday, Walgreens CEO Wentworth said his chain is ‚Äúreorienting to its legacy strength as a retail pharmacy-led company.‚Äù CVS is reportedly weighing a breakup to undo its mergers with Aetna and Caremark. Both companies are also proposing new structures for how they want to be paid for filling prescriptions, hoping this is the big shot in the arm they need. "I'm very confident that over a two- to three-year period we will have reset the framework for reimbursement discussions," Wentworth told investors on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe are in the early stages of a turnaround that will take time.‚Äù Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: ‚ÄòStudents are frustrated‚Äô: College seniors seeking tech jobs face a chilly hiring market
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/16/tech-industry-job-market-hiring-college-graduates/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:00:00Z

When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work. The signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting. ‚ÄúStudents are frustrated,‚Äù Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley‚Äôs career center, tells Fortune. The unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective. So far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That‚Äôs on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year. Things won‚Äôt necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers. In a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That‚Äôs a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles. In response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today‚Äôs computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022. Of any college major, that‚Äôs the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake‚Äôs report notes. Another report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023. Overall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month. At Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet‚Äôs self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,‚Äù Pitcher said. At Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still doing tech roles, but they‚Äôre doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,‚Äù Collins said. Carnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition‚Äôs list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley. And while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,‚Äù Collins said. Madeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she‚Äôd already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing. Searching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said. ‚ÄúYou can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you‚Äôre at a fork in the road where you‚Äôre wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?‚Äù she said. Brutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley ‚Äúpure tech‚Äù companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there. ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: New One Piece, Naruto Games Reportedly Canceled by Bandai Namco

Bandai Namco games involving One Piece, Naruto, and more are supposedly in jeopardy. By Tanner Dedmon Some unannounced games in the worlds of One Piece and Naruto have supposedly been either paused or canceled entirely amid some larger shakeups at Bandai Namco, according to new reports. It‚Äôs been suggested that work on these unknown games is uncertain at the moment due to a underwhelming demand, and the games in flux apparently extend beyond anime titles, too, with a Nintendo project currently on hold at Bandai Namco as well. News of the state of these Naruto and One Piece games supposedly in the works over at Bandai Namco comes from Bloomberg which said that the publisher had either halted or canceled some of its projects. Bloomberg speaks of a ‚Äúlackluster demand,‚Äù though it seems the demand here is referring more to games in general as the gaming industry continues to cut costs by canceling projects and laying off workers. There were no references made to a lack of demand for Naruto and One Piece, specifically, which makes sense given that the latter is more popular than ever after Netflix‚Äôs live-action Naruto series even if the franchise is currently going on a hiatus. That does made it even stranger that Bandai Namco would be reconsidering a One Piece game, however, given its popularity and the fact that we‚Äôve gotten several One Piece games in the last four years. Bandai Namco publishes tons of anime-themed games ‚Äî pretty much any of the more modern ones that you can think of ‚Äî so there‚Äôs no telling what kinds of games these One Piece and Naruto projects were. Many of Bandai Namco‚Äôs anime games are arena fighters like the wonderful Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero while others are a bit more open like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, but they all typically circle back around to beating up anime baddies. But while anime adaptations may be the publisher‚Äôs bread and butter, its work extends beyond that scope as well. Bandai Namco published Elden Ring and other Souls games, for example, and also works with Nintendo on some projects. Two Nintendo franchises Bandai Namco works on are the Mario Kart and Smash Bros. games with a broader team established recently to work closer with Nintendo (though those franchises were not specifically mentioned in the announcement). Mobile games are another focus of Bandai Namco which are also supposedly being impacted by these decisions made internally. Another game, Blue Protocol, was recently confirmed for a shutdown early next year despite having only just released recently. The Western version of the game which was to be published by Amazon has also been canned. As a result of these cancelations and paused games, Bandai Namco is also reducing its workforce with around 200 employees said to be affected. These employee losses also contribute to an already brutal year for gaming studios in terms of layoffs and lost talent.

Title: Walgreens Announces It Will Close 1,200 Stores Across US by 2027

Friends Read Free Pharmacy chain Walgreens announced it will shut down 1,200 stores across the United States over the next three years. Closures of Walgreens stores were announced in June, but the company had not disclosed the number of affected stores at that time. It had more than 8,000 stores in the United States as of Aug. 31 last year. ‚ÄúOur financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 reflected our disciplined execution on cost management, working capital initiatives and capex reduction,‚Äù Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in the statement. He said that in the next fiscal year, Walgreens will be ‚Äúfocusing on stabilizing the retail pharmacy by optimizing [the company‚Äôs] footprint, controlling operating costs, improving cash flow, and continuing to address reimbursement models to support dispensing margins and preserve patient access for the future.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,‚Äù said Wentworth, who was named chief executive officer in 2023. Walgreens, like its competitors, has been struggling for years with tight reimbursement for the prescriptions it sells as well as other challenges such as rising costs to operate its stores. Drugstore chains have also been dealing with more competition from online retail giant Amazon, as well as Walmart and Target. Rival CVS Health Corp. is wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 stores. Another major chain, Rite Aid Corp., emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization earlier this year after whittling its store count down to about 1,300 locations. Walgreens has also been backing away from a plan to add primary care clinics next to some of its stores after launching an aggressive expansion under previous CEO Rosalind Brewer. Walgreens said Tuesday that its net loss swelled to more than $3 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company said softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance hurt operating income. It also booked some hefty charges tied to opioid litigation settlements the company had recognized in previous quarters and an equity investment in China. Walgreens shares rose by almost 4 percent on Tuesday morning before Wall Street‚Äôs opening bell. Earlier in October, CVS said it was cutting about 2,900 jobs across the United States as part of a cost-savings program, according to a statement. Those layoffs will mainly impact corporate jobs and will represent fewer than 1 percent of the company‚Äôs workforce. The reductions, part of CVS‚Äôs previously announced plan, would primarily impact corporate roles and not frontline jobs in stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers, it said.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Japanese video game developer seems to be the latest company not immune to undergoing layoffs and shuttering projects. By Lan Pitts on October 15, 2024 at 9:25AM PDT In a year flush with video-game-company layoffs and restructuring, Bandai Namco has reportedly canceled several titles including games featuring One Piece and Naruto licenses. In addition to those games, there was reportedly an unnamed contract project with Nintendo that has been shuttered as well. In a report by Bloomberg, coinciding with the projects being terminated, it's stated that the company is taking a traditional "Japanese approach to reduce staff and sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily‚Äù so they don't receive any form of severance. The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge." Over the summer, the company further shuttered its long-running Tales of the Rays mobile game and said it would take down its MMO game Blue Protoco starting in January. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol," Bandai Namco said in a statement. "Both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world." Bandai Namcon's latest release, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero saw strong initial sales. The game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, sold more than 3 million units worldwide within its first 24 hours after its launch. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Walgreens is closing more locations. Walgreens is closing approximately 1,200 locations as the drug store chain struggles to contend with online competitors and declining prescription drug payments. By 2027, about one in seven Walgreens currently open will close its doors. About 500 Walgreens will close its doors over the next year, the drug store chain announced Tuesday. Those closures represent a significant escalation from a few months ago, when the financially struggling company announced in June it was shutting 300 underperforming locations as part of a multi-year optimization program under CEO Tim Wentworth. At the time, the company had said about a quarter of Walgreens stores were unprofitable, and the chain promised "imminent" changes. Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts. Major drugstore chains, including CVS and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They've declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term." For Saunders, Walgreens' eliminating the "dead wood will help the company strengthen its financials over time, but it is a huge admission of failure."

Title: Taking voluntary redundancy or getting laid off? You need to know about your tax, welfare and pension options
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/10/15/taking-voluntary-redundancy-or-getting-laid-off-you-need-a-financial-plan-for-the-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T05:00:00Z

Redundancies are common these days. Tech, pharma, finance and consulting workers know the wind can change at brutal speed. You‚Äôre sipping your free wellness smoothie one minute and out the door the next. When redundancy is in the ether, it‚Äôs good to have a financial plan. Drug giant Pfizer is the latest multinational to announce job cuts here. Some 210 of its workers will go over the next year. TikTok, Wayfair and Flutter announced cuts earlier this year. It was Accenture before that, with 890 redundancies announced last year. This followed cuts at Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Stripe and Amazon. There was a snap cost-cutting cull at Twitter too, with 50 per cent of its Dublin office gone. Those are just the ones that made headlines. Derek Maguire, a financial planner with Financial Architects, gets about six to 10 enquiries a week from workers dealing with voluntary or compulsory redundancy. ‚ÄúThe average person coming to us would be on about ‚Ç¨100,000, maybe ‚Ç¨120,000; they are typically aged 50-plus,‚Äù says Maguire. They are skilled and, with the country at near-full employment, they will get another job if they want it, he says. Nevertheless, the prospect of redundancy requires some financial reckoning. ‚ÄúThe main questions people ask us are, ‚Äòcan I afford to take six months or a year off?‚Äô I hear that all the time. They are flat out and they want a break,‚Äù Maguire says. Where there‚Äôs an offer of voluntary redundancy on the table, people are nervous of leaving a generous pension scheme. David Looney, a qualified financial planner with Alpha Wealth in Cork, has helped a lot of people dealing with redundancy this year. Most are skilled, well paid and will have the chance of moving to a similar role. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs about giving them the reassurance that they are in a financial position that they can take a bit of time off,‚Äù says Looney. ‚ÄúSome are almost happy with redundancy. It can give them a financial cushion to take some time off work, to travel, pay off the mortgage, or spend time with the kids before taking up a similar role.‚Äù Both warn that it‚Äôs imperative that those dealing with redundancy don‚Äôt rely solely on canteen chats or a colleague‚Äôs WhatsApp group for financial advice. Your individual severance package, and your tax, pension and savings position will all shape what redundancy will mean for you. Everyone is different. ‚ÄúI remember a case where one person made the wrong decision about how to take redundancy, and eight colleagues followed them and did the same thing, so they all made the wrong decision,‚Äù Maguire says. A severance package might be broken down into three elements, says Looney. The first includes things like holidays you haven‚Äôt been paid for, or pay in lieu of a notice period. Maybe you have a bonus due, too. All of this goes through as a normal salary payment. If you are earning over ‚Ç¨42,000, or ‚Ç¨44,000 from next year, it‚Äôs going to be taxed at the top rate. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a whole lot you can do there, there are no tax-free exemptions,‚Äù says Looney. The second element is the statutory redundancy payment. This part is tax-free. Statutory redundancy is the minimum an employer must pay. It equates to two weeks‚Äô gross pay for each year of your service, plus another one week gross pay. The weekly pay, however, is capped at ‚Ç¨600. So whatever you earn, this will equate to ‚Ç¨1,200 multiplied by your number of years of service, plus ‚Ç¨600. The third element is an ex gratia redundancy payment. This is paid at your employer‚Äôs discretion. An ex gratia payment of six weeks‚Äô pay per year of service as a lump sum would be typical, says Looney. Part of this ex gratia payment is tax-free and part can be taxable at your marginal tax rate. There are three ways to determine the tax-free part under Revenue rules. There is the basic exemption, the increased exemption and the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) ‚Äì this is a tax relief that normally benefits people with higher earnings and long service. Your employer will typically crunch the numbers for you and the highest answer will determine how much of the ex gratia payment is tax-free, says Looney. There is another option you have. If, when calculating the tax-free part of your ex gratia payment, the increased exemption calculation or the SCSB is giving the highest tax-free payment, this can mean waiving your right to a future tax-free lump sum from the part of your pension pot related to that employment. ‚ÄúSo, sometimes the employee has to tick option A to waive their right and take more of their redundancy payment tax-free now, or else tick option B and retain the right to take a tax-free lump sum from their pension on retirement and, in turn, take less of their redundancy payment tax-free now,‚Äù says Looney. [ Pension tax relief rises to cover pots of up to ‚Ç¨2.8m by 2029 under Cabinet plansOpens in new window ] It‚Äôs a case of deciding, do I want more tax-free now or later? ‚ÄúSometimes people automatically think, it‚Äôs best to get as much as I can tax-free now, but they can end up shooting themselves in the foot down the line, particularly if they have a fairly decent pension,‚Äù Looney says. He gives the example of a young tech worker who has built up a pension pot of ‚Ç¨100,000. If this grew over 30 years, it would be worth more than ‚Ç¨400,000 by the time they reach 60. At that point, they can usually take out 25 per cent as a tax-free lump sum, which is over ‚Ç¨100,000. ‚ÄúThat can be quite handy down the line for clearing your mortgage or wiping out any debts and basically helping set you up for retirement,‚Äù says Looney. Where the pension amount with your employer is small, however, it might make sense to waive the right to the retirement lump sum for that part of your pension and to take more tax-free now as it won‚Äôt have a big bearing on your pension, he says. It comes down to cash flow, too. If you don‚Äôt have savings and are concerned about being out of work for a long time, you may need to prioritise paying your mortgage. Some workers want to know if they can afford to take a less well-paid, but a less stressful job next, Maguire says. ‚ÄúI spoke to someone on over ‚Ç¨120,000 who was asking if she can afford to take an ‚Ç¨85,000 job next. She said, I‚Äôm killing myself here at the moment. I don‚Äôt want to be killing myself.‚Äù If you are due a fairly decent severance package, it can come with a big tax bill. One thing you can do to help minimise it is to make a last-minute pension contribution. This has to be done before you leave the company, says Looney. Once you leave an employer, you can‚Äôt make a backdated contribution. You could take some of your holiday pay, payment in lieu of notice, any bonus or potentially your severance payment and put that into your pension, says Looney. Your scope for pension contribution is dependent on your age. Someone in their 30s can contribute 20 per cent tax-free. ‚ÄúThe whole amount would arrive in to their pension and have the potential of growing tax-free in to their retirement rather than it being taxed through the severance payment,‚Äù Looney says. When your role is made redundant, it can be tempting to pull up anchor with that employer entirely ‚Äì but yanking out your pension pot may not be the best choice. ‚ÄúIt can be advantageous to keep your pension pots separate, if you can draw them down at different points in time,‚Äù says Looney. ‚ÄúIf you move it all into your new employer‚Äôs scheme, you might be restricting your fund options and also you may not be able to access your pension pot until you leave or retire from the company,‚Äù he says. When you lose your job, register with your local Intreo office or social welfare branch, even if you don‚Äôt qualify for an unemployment payment. You may be able to get credited PRSI contributions to avoid a break in your social insurance record. You may be entitled to a tax refund. Those with enough PRSI contributions should qualify for Jobseeker‚Äôs Benefit. That‚Äôs a payment of up to ‚Ç¨232 a week, paid for a maximum of nine months, after which you can reapply. There is a sliding scale as to when you can get your first payment. If your redundancy payment is ‚Ç¨50,000 to ‚Ç¨55,000, for example, you are disqualified from claiming Jobseeker‚Äôs Benefit for one week of the nine-month entitlement. Those getting a redundancy payment of ‚Ç¨90,000 and over are disqualified for nine weeks. Older workers used to be the ones in the redundancy crosshairs. Some companies operated formulas, notes a company remuneration insider. One veteran tech employer operated the ‚Äú75‚Ä≥ rule ‚Äì if your age and your number of years‚Äô service exceeded 75, your number was up. A financial institution operated a policy that if you were over 50 and on more than ‚Ç¨50,000, it was time to go. Not all, but some staff looked forward to eventually meeting the criteria to get paid to go. Rolling redundancies are the operating model in many sectors now. ‚ÄúThis year, we are seeing redundancy packages to a much younger cohort ‚Äì within tech companies, for example,‚Äù Looney says. ‚ÄúWe are dealing with people in their 20s and 30s getting redundancy packages.‚Äù As well as company metrics for employee wellness, there are metrics around salary and pension costs, too. When an employee becomes too expensive, says the insider, then comes redundancy. When a shareholder flaps its wings in Silicon Valley or China, it can mean a tornado for workers here. ‚ÄúSome are handpicked, they will get rid of the deadwood, and then they will look at costs. Are there people we can replace, perhaps for a lower salary and pension?‚Äù If you wonder why the average age in some companies never edges past 30, it‚Äôs not because the employees don‚Äôt age. ¬© 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: I quit Amazon after being assigned 21 direct reports and burning out. I worry about the decision to flatten its hierarchy.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a 45-year-old burnout coach in Auburn, Washington, about her experience as a manager at Amazon. It's been edited for length and clarity. I worked at Amazon in the HR space for nearly a decade. Over time, I went from managing zero to 21 direct reports across multiple continents. Being thrust into a managerial role taught me to use my time efficiently and communicate effectively across a diverse network of employees. It was hard, but ultimately, it made me a better leader. I truly love and still believe in Amazon, but I struggled to effectively manage nearly two dozen people and quit in April when my physical health was suffering, and I was burning out. I started at Amazon as a senior launch manager in the grocery delivery space. The job was fast-paced, and I was constantly traveling, overseeing the building of new grocery fulfillment centers. In just two years. I completely burned out and decided to switch career tracks. I landed in HR, which I stayed in for the next eight years of my career at Amazon. I hopped around several HR departments before landing in the heart of HR as a pure business partner in 2019. We had adequate funding, and it was the best-functioning team I've ever been on at Amazon, but I felt there wasn't room to grow. I'd been at virtually the same level for seven years and was looking for a promotion. So, I left Amazon to work in HR at Blue Origin, another Jeff Bezos company. Due to it being a new startup, it was absolute chaos, and I found myself back at Amazon in another HR role a year later, in 2022. I was initially hired as program manager of business continuity to help smooth the transition during a massive organizational disruption. I managed mass layoffs and employee redistribution. Then I was unexpectedly appointed as manager for two teams, which included 11 employees based across China, India, and some of Europe. Managing employees across several different time zones and adding to my preexisting work was difficult. Previously in my career at Amazon, I had managed a maximum of three to four indirect reports. I always prided myself on giving my people an hour of individual virtual face time each week to discuss career development, offer support, and get to know them. I used our meetings as an opportunity to learn what skills employees were looking to develop so I could delegate tasks accordingly. I tried to continue that trend with all 11 of my employees, therefore spending 11 hours a week in individual virtual meetings alone. It was laborious but manageable. A few months later, a coworker went on maternity leave, and I had to take on her team, leaving me with 21 direct reports. My weekly individual meetings were no longer plausible, so I had to cut them in half. Taking on so many employees taught me to communicate more effectively, efficiently, and asynchronously since none of my teams resided in the same time zone. I also learned to adjust and diversify my leadership style, not just for so many people but for so many cultures. I really enjoyed learning more about everyone's cultures to better connect, understand, and lead. Although it was hard, I became a better manager, a better communicator, and a more creative and organized leader. Unfortunately, compressing my time with each employee was detrimental to the success of my teams. Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues. We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development. One of my highest-performing reports came to me and said she was transferring teams because she didn't feel like she had enough time and couldn't work on what she wanted. I gave her my blessing because I would've done the same. I also saw some performance issues popping up on my team because I couldn't give them the dedicated time and feedback they needed to work through problems. For example, several of my employees were struggling to write white papers. This hurt my heart because my job as a manager is to help people overcome obstacles. When you have less time with team members, they get stuck on things longer, and daily processes slow down. Managerial skills don't just magically appear, they need to be learned. Even though I struggled to manage nearly two dozen employees, I feel extremely lucky that I came to Amazon with managerial experience. Before Amazon, I'd worked at Target, where I went through a rigorous management training process. At the time, Amazon required new managers to complete a self-guided manager training course within 30 days. However, even as an experienced manager, I felt overwhelmed by the number of videos I had to watch. Also, I didn't feel that they were the most effective way to learn. I started to burn out from the workload. It's ironic because, as an HR partner, I used to tell incoming employees that no one would ever tell them to go home and stop working, but if they had strong boundaries, people would respect them. That used to be my experience. But I felt responsible for so many people at once, which made it difficult to hold my boundaries. I also stopped enjoying work. My work felt bureaucratic, and I was so focused on staying on top of each little task that I wasn't contributing to things that were moving the needle. I felt like I couldn't be the manager I wanted to be, which was disappointing. So, I decided to officially quit in April. I worry about this fallout continuing as Amazon prepares to flatten its organization in January, but I still believe Amazon can be a magical place full of innovation, autonomy, and creativity. It has always been decentralized, which permits people to move very fast if they have funding, supportive leadership, and a clear, shared vision. Amazon representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.
