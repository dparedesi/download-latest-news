Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note Friday, “We believe last night was a glimpse of the future of Tesla and next generation transportation for consumers.” He also noted the presence of Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, which was “well ahead” of Wedbush expectations. Musk said Optimus could be "[the] biggest product ever of any kind" in terms of commercial success, Bank of America (BAC) analysts noted. The AI tech underlying the robot is the same as that used in Tesla’s vehicles. “We think this speaks to the fact that at this point TSLA is more than a traditional automotive company,” Bank of America analysts said. While noting the lack of details on Tesla’s Cybercab rollout, Wedbush’s Ives said, “[W]e strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.” The overall muted reaction to Tesla’s robotaxi launch is a good sign for ride-hailing companies Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). “Clearly building and launching a service is the longer-term direction for Tesla but the vagueness around the service (or clarity in not saying it) may reduce fears that UBER and LYFT would have to start defending share as soon as next — which was our primary fear coming in,” RBC's Narayan said. Uber and Lyft shares both jumped around 10% Friday. Wall Street has mixed opinions on Tesla stock. Some 26 of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying it, while 20 have a Hold rating and 15 advise investors to sell it. Overall, analysts see shares falling to $216.59 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) won't have to report its transactions in Bank of America (BAC) stock promptly anymore. That's because Buffett continued his recent selloff of Berkshire's holdings in the bank, and no longer has a 10% stake, the level required to give timely updates on investments. In a securities filing, Berkshire said it had sold about 9.5 million shares of BofA over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at an average price of approximately $40, netting some $380 million. Following the sale, Berkshire owns 775 million BofA shares. Berkshire began dumping the bank's stock in mid-July, and last month shed another 5.8 million shares. Asked about that then, BofA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Moynihan called Buffett "a great shareholder," and explained that he didn't know why Buffett was selling, but wasn't worried. "Life will go on," he added. The news didn't hurt Bank of America shares, which rose 5% Friday morning along with other bank stocks, and are up about 25% year-to-date. TradingView

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Bank of America Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year). To earn $500 monthly from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Bank of America's $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $230,587 worth of Bank of America, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $46,125 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). View more earnings on BAC Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Bank of America fell by 0.6% to close at $39.97 on Thursday. The firm will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 15, Analysts expect Bank of America to report quarterly earnings at 77 cents per share. That’s down from 90 cents per share in the year-ago period. Bank of America projects to report revenue of $25.29 billion for the recent quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro. On Oct. 9, RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy reiterated Bank of America with an Outperform and maintained a $46 price target.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares are rising in premarket trading after its results beat estimates; investors are watching wholesale inflation numbers following yesterday's CPI report; Tesla (TSLA) shares are sinking after unveiling its "Cybercab"; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) reduces its stake in Bank of America (BAC) to below 10%; and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding slightly after falling yesterday following an artificial intelligence (AI) event. Here's what investors need to know today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are rising about 1.5% in premarket trading after the world's largest bank by market cap reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.37 on revenue of $42.65 billion, above consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha of $3.97 and $40.85 billion, respectively. JPMorgan shares have gained more than 25% this year. After yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation isn't falling as fast as some economists expected, investors will be closely watching another data point with today's 8:30 a.m. ET release of the wholesale-focused Producer Price Index (PPI). Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires projected that prices at the wholesale level will have increased by 0.1% in September from the prior month, down from a 0.2% rise in August. Tesla (TSLA) shares are dropping 6% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker unveiled several new products at an event yesterday, including its highly anticipated "Cybercab" robotaxi. Tesla also showed off a larger version of the autonomous vehicle called a "Robovan," as well as its Optimus humanoid robot. Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that the Cybercab would cost about $30,000 and be in production by 2026. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) continues to reduce its stake in Bank of America (BAC). According to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold more than 9.5 million shares of the bank's stock. The move lowers Berkshire's stake in Bank of America to less than 10%, meaning it will face fewer reporting requirements from the SEC. Shares of Bank of America are up about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding by about 1% in premarket trading after they fell about 4% in the prior session following an event to show off the chipmaker's next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. At the event, AMD unveiled its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, as well as its Instinct MI300X series Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chip and other technology. The lineup initially failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA).

(Bloomberg) — Warren Buffett’s conglomerate has added another zero to its haul from a months-long selling spree of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) stock.

For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal In its 14th round of disposals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. eclipsed $10 billion of total proceeds from whittling its stake in the second-largest US bank, a regulatory filing on Monday shows. Buffett, 94, began paring the massive investment in mid-July, putting pressure on the stock’s price ever since. In the latest batch, Berkshire reaped $383 million over three trading days, as it unloaded fewer shares than in many previous rounds. Buffett’s selling has tended to trickle off when the stock’s price falls toward $39, his company’s filings show. The shares closed at $39.96 on Monday. Berkshire’s remaining 10.1% stake is worth about $31.4 billion at that price. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.
