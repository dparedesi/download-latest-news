U.S. equities were slightly lower at midday as the market weighed the potential impact of the latest Trump administration tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrials Average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down marginally. Shares of alternative energy firms, including Enphase Energy (ENPH), First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), dipped after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to slash most government support for the industry. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners declined along with the price of the precious metal as higher bond yields made gold a less attractive investment. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped on downgrades from HSBC, which warned it had become more cautious about bank stocks following their recent runup. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) shares gained on an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which brushed off previous concerns about the toolmaker's earnings revisions, and saw improvement in its end markets. U.S.-listed shares of Sequans Communications (SQNS) soared when the Paris-based manufacturer of semiconductors for the Internet of Things said it had raised $384 million to begin buying bitcoin. GlobalFoundries (GFS) shares jumped after the chipmaker bought artificial intelligence and processor IP supplier MIPS. The price was not given. Oil futures advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, and was little changed against the euro. Major cryptocurrencies mostly rose. TradingView

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Several of the large banking institutions in the US passed the Stress Tests imposed by the Federal Reserve. As a result, they announced their intentions to raise dividends and boost buyback allocations. I went through the list of increases from last week, and focused on the institutions that have a ten year track record of annual dividend increases: I also added ten year charts showcasing the trends in share price, quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends. In order to understand equity returns, you need to decompose them to their sources. Equity returns are a function of: 1. Dividend Yields 2. Earnings Per Share Growth 3. Change in valuation In the long-run, the first two items (dividends and earnings per share) are the so called fundamental sources of returns. They drive the total return over periods longer than say a decade. The changes of valuation matter the least in the very long-run. In the short-run however, for periods of five to ten years or less, valuation does matter a lot. This is why your returns would be much different if you bought a company at a starting yield of 4% versus a starting yield of 2%. That being said, rising earnings and dividends matter a lot too, because they provide the needed fuel behind great returns in the long-run. However, if you manage to acquire a good company at a discount, your potential returns will be higher. Visualizing the interplay between dividend yields, earnings per share growth and the changes in valuation showcases where returns have come from perfectly well. It also provides the perspective to determine where we are today, and also to potentially provide some markers as to where a potential future buy point could be set at.
