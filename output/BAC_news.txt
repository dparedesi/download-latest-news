Boeing’s (BA+4.23%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. West highlighted progress on manufacturing, citing “fantastic” performance in its push to complete 38 aircraft per month and the stabilization of 787 output at five per month. He didn’t anticipate a material near-term impact from tariffs, but admitted to concerns about parts availability. Wednesday’s increase means the company’s shares are trading roughly unchanged so far this year despite unresolved concerns about the effects of President Donald Trump’s imposed and planned tariffs. The company has many suppliers outside the U.S. and must keep prices contained to be able to effectively compete against Airbus (AIR-0.13%) in the commercial plane market. CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff earlier this month that Trump’s tariffs would boost costs on parts like landing gear that are imported from Canada, Bloomberg News reported. Boeing has a Winnipeg-based division that makes more than 500 parts and assemblies for its commercial unit, and is a “tier 1" partner on the 787 Dreamliner, which is assembled in South Carolina. Boeing is also one of the top 10 manufacturers in Mexico and spends up to $1 billion in the nation through its supply chain, according to a company fact sheet. It spends more than $500 million in Mexico each year on commercial airplane parts. Tariffs could create a “continuity of supply issue,” Ortberg said. Boeing’s aircraft are made up of thousands of parts subject to demanding specifications, so suppliers aren’t easily replaced. Aerospace expert Jerrold Lundquist recently noted that a Boeing 737 has about 2,000 parts sourced from 700 suppliers. The CEO of the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, AerCap (AER-1.97%), said earlier that under the worst-case trade war scenario, the price of a 787 could increase by $40 million. “No one’s going to want to pay that,” Angus Kelley told told CNBC’s Squawk Box on March 12. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: Hims & Hers stock tumbles as the FDA issues a warning about 'unapproved' weight loss drugs

Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.20%), the millennial-skewed telehealth company, saw its stock tumble nearly 9% on Tuesday, as the company braces for big regulatory shifts in the weight-loss drug industry. Hims stock took a hit just a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated a page on its website outlining its concerns with the use of what it calls “unapproved GLP-1 drugs.” GLP-1 drugs are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.35%) Ozempic, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. The FDA warned Monday that the use of unapproved versions of these drugs including compounded versions can “be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA’s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.” Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. Hims & Hers was able to sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available. Now that the Ozempic shortage is over, Hims & Hers will have to stop selling “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide this year. The FDA said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide starting May 22 or after a judge rules on a lawsuit from the industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association — whichever comes later. “We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call in February. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs. Additionally, on Tuesday Bank of America Securities (BAC+0.06%) analyst Allen Lutz adjusted the firm’s price target for Hims & Hers by $1 to $22 — notably $12 below the stock’s opening price that day. Lutz maintained an “underperform” (sell) rating. Lutz noted that while overall sales grew 124% year over year in February, GLP-1 medications now make up about 45% of the company’s online revenue. Meanwhile, growth outside of GLP-1s has slowed, with core sales increasing just 30% in February — down from 40% in the fourth quarter and 47-50% in the third. “Slowing core growth is an important barometer as semaglutide could exit the model at any time and now represents close to 50% of sales,” Lutz wrote.

Title: Watch live: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang introduces new AI chips at the GTC

All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA-1.05%) chief executive Jensen Huang today as he shares more about the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he would discuss the chipmaker’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual GPU Technology Conference, also known as the GTC. Huang said the company has “some really exciting things to share” at the developer conference about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Huang said on the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Jefferies (JEF+0.64%) analysts said in a note last week that they expect Nvidia’s product announcements at the GTC “to be another positive catalyst” for the company “as investors move past supply-chain noise and can once again get excited about the technology roadmap.” Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) said in a note last week that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. Bank of America analysts are also anticipating more information on Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology, and what the chipmaker’s long-term opportunities are in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said Nvidia is likely to talk more about its Project DIGITS personal AI supercomputer at the GTC, in comments shared with Quartz. “I’ve been saying for years that Nvidia GPU systems are ‘like the iPhone cycle, but better,’” Cook said. “What I mean is that enterprises will pay for the latest, better, and faster from Jensen, but they can still use their old hardware, too, because it’s all integrated and updated by CUDA software.” Cook said he thinks DIGITS will give smaller developers the ability to build their own physical AI models and agentic AI applications. “With the introduction of DIGITS, we have another Apple (AAPL+0.56%) moment for Nvidia as they have created a personal tool that costs less than 5% of the price of the newest Blackwell GPUs, and every developer and startup founder will want one for their desk or home system,” Cook said.
