Title: Berkshire Hathaway’s Second Quarter 2025 Portfolio Moves

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. "The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot, and if people are yelling, 'Swing, you bum!' ignore them." – Warren Buffett in the HBO Documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett” (2017) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) second-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on August 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the US publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s second-quarter earnings report, which contains information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, was released on Saturday, August 2. Berkshire’s $257.5 billion investment portfolio consists of 41 companies, five more than reported for last quarter. Berkshire was a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for 70% of the total portfolio. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with 87% of assets in the top ten holdings. Before the 2024 sales, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 22%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling since 2024 has taken technology to an underweight. While Berkshire Hathaway had no change in its Apple (AAPL) position for the first quarter, it was trimmed again in the second quarter. Despite continued trimming of Bank of America (BAC) in the second quarter, the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at 39% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28.1% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has two small holdings in the industrial sector: Heico-A (HEI/A), which was added to in the quarter, and Allegion PLC (ALLE), which was a new addition to the portfolio. Allegion provides security products, systems, and services and is based in Ireland. Within any recollection, the portfolio has had no real estate companies, but that changed in the second quarter with the purchase of Lamar Advertising-A (LAMR). Lamar is not a typical real estate company, as it owns and operates outdoor advertising. Berkshire continues to own no publicly traded utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines via Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. According to regulatory filings in March 2025, Berkshire now has 8.5% to 9.8% ownership in these trading companies. In Buffett’s 2024 annual letter, he noted that all five companies had agreed to relax the previously agreed-upon 10% ownership ceiling. At the recent annual meeting, Buffett said he “won’t give a thought” to selling them and expects Berkshire to own them for fifty years or more. In the first quarter, Berkshire requested and received confidential treatment for “one or more holding(s)” from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Typically, this means Buffett or another investment professional is attempting to continue to add to the holding, and disclosure would likely drive the price higher. It was revealed along with the second-quarter filing that the three secret holdings were Nucor (NUE), Lennar-A (LEN), and D.R. Horton (DHI). Nucor is a steel maker. Lennar and D.R. Horton are builders of single-family homes. While single-family home sales are well off their recent peak and even 2005 levels, these homebuilders have remained profitable. There is a case that the US needs more housing stock, and our current homes are aging, which could provide a long-term opportunity, despite the short-term industry challenges of affordability and high mortgage interest rates. The UnitedHealth Group (UNH), provider of healthcare insurance, was also added to the portfolio in the second quarter. Berkshire added to its positions in Constellation Brands (STZ), Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Chevron (OXY), Lennar-B (LEN/B), and Heico-A (HEI/A). Berkshire added to its previously held position in the Lennar B-shares. Berkshire eliminated its T-Mobile (TMUS) positions. As noted previously, Berkshire reduced its positions in Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Davita (DVA) were also trimmed. Notably, the Davita sales were related to a 2024 agreement in which Davita will buy back shares quarterly from Berkshire when its stake rises above 45%. This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior returns on capital as measured by return on equity with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Notably, Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the superior return on equity combined with an exceptional free cash flow yield. Berkshire was a net seller of $3 billion in publicly traded stocks in the second quarter, the eleventh straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway’s net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $3.9 billion of stocks while selling $6.9 billion. Driven by earnings and continued stock sales, Berkshire has amassed a massive cash pile on an absolute basis and relative to the company’s size. Buffett and his associates have been unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. At the annual meeting, Buffett said that Berkshire “holds a lot more cash and Treasury bills than I would like.” He always looks for investments, but “things don’t come along in an orderly fashion.” Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio remained elevated during the second quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. The stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 were likely done at around 1.4-1.5 times book value. Berkshire’s stock reached almost 1.8 times book in May 2025, so a lack of repurchases in the quarter wasn’t unexpected. Despite the lack of enough compelling publicly traded stock opportunities, following the decline in its own shares, Berkshire’s valuation is nearing a level where repurchases might restart. Share repurchases of Berkshire stock had been off the table at the elevated valuations, but an additional lever for Buffett to create value might soon return.

Title: Berkshire Hathaway 13F Filing Reveals Warren Buffett's Secret Stock

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a position in embattled healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group and reported smaller stakes in longtime holdings Apple and Bank of America, according to a regulatory filing Thursday. Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) at the end of the second quarter held 5 million shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) valued at about $1.6 billion. The company has likely been accumulating shares since the fourth quarter of last year, when it first asked regulators to let it build a position in secret to avoid a price spike. Shares of UnitedHealth Group jumped more than 10% in extended trading Thursday. Berkshire also opened smaller new positions in security products provider Allegion (ALLE), homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI), Lamar Advertising (LAMR), and steelmaker Nucor (NUE), all of which saw their stocks rise after hours. T-Mobile (TMUS) was Berkshire’s sole exit. The conglomerate sold the entirety of its $1 billion stake in the telecommunications giant. It also offloaded nearly half of its Charter Communications (CHTR) holdings. Berkshire made smaller cuts to two of its largest holdings, selling 20 million of its 300 million Apple (AAPL) shares and 26 million of its 630 million Bank of America (BAC) shares. Buffett began paring Berkshire’s stakes in both last year. Buffett scooped up 3 million shares of Chevron (CVX), another of his biggest holdings, and left stakes in longtime investments Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP) untouched. Berkshire slashed its exposure to banks in the first quarter, exiting its position in Citigroup (C) and trimming its holdings of Bank of America and Capital One (COF). On the flip side, the firm added to some of its food and beverage holdings, including alcohol maker Constellation Brands (STZ) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). In the second quarter, the firm seemed to favor homebuilders. On top of entering D.R. Horton, Berkshire bought about 7 million shares of competitor Lennar (LEN), upping its stake from just 150,000 shares. Berkshire shares have shed about 11% of their value since Buffett announced in early May that he would step down as CEO at the end of 2025. Still, the stock is up almost 6% since the start of the year.
