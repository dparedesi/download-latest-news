Bank of America (BAC) says it has just approved a new multi-billion-dollar stock-buyback program. In a new announcement, the largest bank stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio says its board of directors has approved a $40 billion common stock repurchase program that goes into effect on August 1st. A stock buyback is when a company buys shares of its own stock, reducing the total number of outstanding shares, according to Bankrate. Buybacks are seen as a way to increase value for investors. Says Bank of America, “[Wednesday’s] authorization will continue providing additional capital return flexibility, reflecting the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the economic cycle.” The new program replaces the existing program, which had $9.1 billion in common stock repurchases remaining. Bank of America also announced a dividend increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter, for a total of $0.28 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26th to shareholders of record as of September 5th. Bank of America has a market cap of $360.3 billion and is trading for $48.45 per share at time of writing. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 631.57 million shares of Bank of America, its fourth most valuable holding, behind Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both represent high-quality banking investments with strong ... More fundamentals and attractive dividend profiles. As we move deeper into 2025, investors seeking exposure to the banking sector face an intriguing choice between two of America's largest financial institutions: Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Both banks have demonstrated resilience through various economic cycles and offer compelling investment opportunities, yet each presents distinct advantages and considerations for portfolio allocation. This comprehensive analysis examines the fundamental strengths, financial metrics and growth prospects of both banking giants to help investors determine which stock may offer superior returns heading into Q3 2025. We'll explore their recent performance, valuation metrics, dividend profiles and the specific risks that could impact their trajectories in the coming quarters. Before diving into the comparative analysis, it's essential to understand the core business models and market positions of these two financial powerhouses. Both institutions operate as diversified banking conglomerates, yet they possess unique characteristics that differentiate their investment appeal and risk profiles in the current market environment. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the United States by assets, serving millions of consumers and businesses worldwide. The institution has built its reputation on comprehensive retail banking services, wealth management through Merrill Lynch, and robust corporate and investment banking operations. With a market capitalization of $358.7 billion, BAC has positioned itself as a leader in digital banking innovation and consumer lending. The bank's strategic focus on operational efficiency and technology investments has yielded significant cost savings while enhancing customer experience. BAC's strong presence in high-growth markets and its emphasis on relationship banking have contributed to steady deposit growth and improved net interest margins, making it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to traditional banking fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase reigns as America's largest bank by assets and market capitalization, boasting a commanding $814.9 billion market cap that reflects its dominant position in the financial services landscape. The institution operates across multiple segments, including consumer and community banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management, providing unparalleled diversification within the banking sector. JPM's reputation for prudent risk management and consistent profitability has made it a benchmark for banking excellence. The bank's substantial investment banking operations and trading revenues provide additional income streams beyond traditional lending. Its global reach and sophisticated technology platform enable it to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and maintain competitive advantages across all business lines. Both banking stocks have demonstrated positive momentum in 2025, reflecting broader market optimism about the financial sector’s prospects amid evolving economic conditions. As of July 24, 2025, Bank of America trades at $48.39, representing a modest daily gain of 0.52%, while JPMorgan commands a significantly higher share price of $296.55, down 0.71% for the session. The performance differential between these stocks reflects not only their respective market capitalizations but also investor sentiment regarding their future earnings potential. JPMorgan's higher absolute share price and larger market cap indicate greater institutional confidence in its ability to generate consistent returns. In contrast, Bank of America's more accessible price point has attracted both retail and institutional investors seeking value opportunities in the banking sector. From a valuation perspective, both banks present compelling opportunities, though with different risk-reward profiles. Bank of America currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.15, compared to JPMorgan's slightly higher P/E of 15.21. This modest premium for JPM reflects the market's recognition of its superior profitability and diversified revenue streams. Looking forward, the valuation gap narrows considerably, with BAC's forward P/E of 12.17 suggesting stronger expected earnings growth compared to JPM's forward P/E of 15.28. Bank of America's earnings per share of $3.41, compared to JPMorgan's $19.48, reflects the difference in share count and absolute profitability. However, the forward metrics indicate that BAC may offer more attractive earnings growth potential relative to its current valuation. The growth trajectories of both institutions reflect their strategic positioning and the market opportunities they face. Bank of America's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation has positioned it well for sustained earnings growth, particularly as interest rate environments stabilize and credit conditions normalize. The bank's substantial consumer deposit base provides a stable funding source that could drive margin expansion. JPMorgan's growth potential stems from its diversified business model and global reach. The bank's investment banking and trading operations offer upside exposure to market volatility and deal activity, while its asset management division benefits from growing demand for wealth management services. JPM's superior scale and resources enable it to invest heavily in technology and expansion opportunities that smaller competitors cannot match, potentially driving long-term gains in market share. Dividend investors will find compelling opportunities in both stocks, though with different characteristics. Bank of America offers a forward dividend yield of 2.16% with a quarterly payment of $1.04 per share, while JPMorgan provides a 1.89% yield through its quarterly dividend of $5.60. BAC's higher yield compensates for its lower absolute dividend payment and appeals to income-focused investors. JPMorgan demonstrates superior dividend growth consistency with 15 years of consecutive increases compared to Bank of America's 11-year streak. The three-year compound annual growth rate of the dividend favors JPM at approximately 12% versus BAC's 7%, indicating a more substantial historical commitment to dividend growth. Both banks maintain healthy payout ratios of less than 30%, suggesting sustainable dividend policies with room for future increases. Both banking stocks face common industry headwinds that could impact their performance in the third quarter of 2025 and beyond. Interest rate uncertainty remains a primary concern, as changes in Federal Reserve policy could affect net interest margins and loan demand. Rising rates generally benefit banks through improved margins, but rapid increases could dampen economic activity and increase credit risks. Credit quality deterioration represents another significant risk, particularly as economic conditions evolve and consumer spending patterns shift. Both banks maintain substantial loan portfolios that could face increased defaults during economic downturns. Additionally, regulatory changes and compliance costs continue to pressure profitability across the banking sector. Bank-specific risks include Bank of America's significant exposure to the consumer lending and mortgage markets, which could face pressure from fluctuations in the housing market. JPMorgan's investment banking operations, while providing diversification benefits, also expose the bank to market volatility and fluctuations in deal flow, which could impact the consistency of quarterly earnings. Wall Street analysts maintain generally positive outlooks for both banking stocks, with both receiving "Buy" ratings from the consensus. Bank of America carries a price target of $50.03, representing potential upside of approximately 3.7% from current levels. This modest target suggests analysts view the stock as fairly valued with limited near-term appreciation potential. JPMorgan's analyst price target of $301.62 suggests a potential upside of approximately 1.8%, reflecting the market's recognition that the stock may be approaching fair value levels. The smaller upside potential for JPM compared to BAC suggests that analysts see greater value opportunity in Bank of America at current price levels, though both stocks receive favorable recommendations. The analyst consensus reflects confidence in both banks' fundamental strength and ability to navigate current market conditions. However, the price targets suggest that investors seeking maximum upside potential may find Bank of America more attractive. At the same time, those prioritizing stability and consistent performance may prefer JPMorgan's proven track record. Based on the comprehensive analysis of financial metrics, growth prospects and market positioning, Bank of America emerges as the more attractive investment opportunity for Q3 2025. The combination of attractive valuation metrics, a higher dividend yield, and superior forward earnings growth potential makes BAC a compelling investment for investors seeking both income and appreciation. Bank of America's forward P/E ratio of 12.17, compared to JPMorgan's 15.28, suggests a better value at current prices, while the higher dividend yield provides immediate income benefits. The bank's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation positions it well for continued margin expansion and earnings growth as market conditions stabilize. However, investors with lower risk tolerance may still prefer JPMorgan's proven stability and diversified revenue streams. JPM's superior scale, longer dividend growth history and resilient business model make it an excellent choice for conservative investors prioritizing capital preservation and consistent income generation over maximum returns. Bottom Line Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both represent high-quality banking investments with strong fundamentals and attractive dividend profiles. While JPMorgan offers superior scale and diversification benefits, Bank of America provides better value at current prices with higher dividend yield and more substantial forward earnings growth potential. For investors seeking maximum upside in Q3 2025, BAC's combination of attractive valuation, operational improvements and income generation makes it the preferred choice. However, JPM remains an excellent option for risk-averse investors prioritizing stability and consistent performance.
