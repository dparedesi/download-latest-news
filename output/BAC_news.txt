Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday afternoon in the wake of strong bank earnings and indications of more Federal Reserve rate cuts ahead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow were all higher. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged, leading broader gains for semiconductor companies a day after the chipmaker announced a deal to sell chips to Oracle (ORCL). Also helping lift semiconductor stocks was an update from chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML), which said AI-driven demand was strong. Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) gained after both financial firms reported better-than-expected results on booming investment banking revenue. Bunge Global (BG) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as the soybean exporter stands to benefit from soybean trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Progressive (PGR) shares slumped after the insurer reported its combined ratio rose on higher costs. Shares of F5 (FFIV) also dropped after the cloud services firm reported a cyberattack by government hackers. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) shares declined after the drugmaker cut the top end of its earnings guidance on concerns about the impact of tariffs. Gold price climbed to a fresh high, while oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Full Content:
After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.
