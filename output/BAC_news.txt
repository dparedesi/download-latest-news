These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term ... [+] investors in 2025. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long served as a beacon for value investors seeking quality companies with durable competitive advantages. As we move through 2025, several of Berkshire's holdings stand out as attractive investments, combining strong fundamentals with reasonable valuations despite the broader market's continued focus on technology and growth stocks. This analysis examines five of the most promising Berkshire Hathaway positions that offer investors strong business models, competitive moats and potential for long-term capital appreciation. Each selection represents a company that aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy and appears well-positioned for success in today's evolving economic landscape. Buffett’s investment strategy centers on identifying companies with strong competitive advantages, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent free cash flow. His philosophy emphasizes purchasing great businesses at reasonable prices rather than mediocre businesses at bargain prices. This approach has proven successful through multiple market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway delivering compound annual returns well above market averages over several decades. The “Oracle of Omaha” focuses on businesses he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models lacking transparent earnings potential. He prioritizes companies with pricing power, strong brand recognition and the ability to maintain or expand market share even during economic downturns. This conservative yet effective approach has made Buffett one of history's most successful investors. This selection process focused on Berkshire Hathaway’s current portfolio holdings, analyzing each position based on fundamental strength, market position and alignment with Buffett's investment principles. I prioritized companies with strong cash flows, reasonable valuations and durable competitive advantages. Special attention was paid to recent business performance, management effectiveness and potential catalysts for future growth. Each selected company was evaluated against current market conditions and sector-specific challenges. I considered factors such as return on equity, debt levels and free cash flow generation. Additionally, I examined each company's ability to maintain or grow market share in their respective industries while delivering consistent returns to shareholders. Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, serving approximately 66 million consumers and small business clients with about 4,000 retail financial centers. The bank has successfully transformed its digital capabilities, with over 90% of all consumer transactions now conducted through digital channels. Their conservative lending practices and strong balance sheet position them well in the current economic environment. Bank of America represents Berkshire's largest financial sector holding, with a stake now valued north of $35 billion and accounting for more than 8% of Berkshire's portfolio, and for good reason. The bank's diversified revenue streams, with consumer banking contributing around 35% of revenue, wealth management above 20%, and investment banking approximately 25%, coupled with a tier 1 capital ratio exceeding 11%, position it well amid varying economic conditions. Their strong capital position, with stress test results showing capacity to maintain dividends even under severe economic scenarios, and focus on operational efficiency – demonstrated by a cost-to-income ratio below 60% and declining – make it well-positioned to benefit from the current interest rate environment above 5%. Net interest income margins have expanded north of 2.5%, contributing to return on equity around 15%. Recent investments exceeding $3.5 billion annually in digital technology have improved customer satisfaction scores above 80% while reducing operating costs by approximately 20% per transaction, leading to enhanced profitability metrics. Digital engagement now exceeds 75% of total consumer interactions, with mobile users growing at around 10% annually. The bank's efficiency ratio has improved to below 60%, while maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio around 70%, providing ample liquidity for future growth. Their wealth management division alone generates over $5 billion in annual revenue, with client balances north of $3 trillion, providing stable fee-based income regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Coca-Cola remains the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. The company's recent strategic initiatives have focused on expanding its presence in growing categories such as ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks, and premium waters. Their adaptive business model has successfully responded to changing consumer preferences while maintaining strong brand equity. As one of Buffett's longest-held positions, acquired for less than $1.3 billion and now worth north of $25 billion, Coca-Cola exemplifies his preference for businesses with strong brands and pricing power, demonstrated by operating margins above 30% despite inflationary pressures and ability to maintain price increases around 8% annually without significant volume impact. The company's extensive distribution network, reaching over 200 markets globally and servicing north of 25 million retail customer outlets, coupled with marketing capabilities exceeding $4 billion annually, create significant barriers to entry. Their market share exceeds 45% in global carbonated beverages, while maintaining a presence in over 80% of all food service locations worldwide. The company's strategic expansion into healthier beverages, with non-carbonated brands growing at around 15% annually and now representing more than 30% of portfolio revenue, effectively addresses changing consumer trends. Premium water brands alone contribute north of $7 billion in annual revenue, growing at double-digit rates. The company has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years, demonstrating remarkable consistency in shareholder returns, with a payout ratio around 75% and free cash flow conversion exceeding 95% of net income. Their return on invested capital remains above 20%, while maintaining a global brand value estimated north of $90 billion, making it one of the most valuable brands worldwide. Apple has evolved from a computer manufacturer into a global technology ecosystem encompassing hardware, software and services. The company's iPhone remains its flagship product, but its services segment, including Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store, has grown to represent over 20% of revenue. Recent ventures into augmented reality and artificial intelligence demonstrate its continued innovation leadership. Despite being a technology company, Apple fits Buffett's investment criteria through its industry-leading brand loyalty, with retention rates north of 90% in its core iPhone business, unmatched pricing power evidenced by average selling prices around 50% higher than competitors, and massive cash generation exceeding $100 billion annually. The company's ecosystem creates high switching costs through over 2 billion active devices globally, while its services business, growing at around 15% annually and maintaining margins above 70%, provides recurring revenue streams now accounting for north of 25% of total revenue. Apple's share repurchase program, having returned over $600 billion to shareholders since inception and reducing share count by approximately 25%, combines with a dividend that's grown at a double-digit rate for over a decade. The company's fortress balance sheet, with north of $150 billion in cash and investments, and market leadership position – commanding around 50% of the premium smartphone market in North America and maintaining App Store gross margins above 80% – make it a compelling long-term investment. The company's emerging revenue streams, including wearables growing at over 20% annually and representing a market size larger than 75% of Fortune 500 companies, coupled with its nascent AI initiatives and rumored electric vehicle ambitions, provide multiple vectors for future growth while maintaining operating margins above 30%. Occidental Petroleum is a leading oil and gas producer with premier assets in the Permian Basin. The company’s integrated business model includes chemical manufacturing and carbon management solutions. Recent investments in carbon capture technology and low-carbon initiatives position OXY as a leader in sustainable energy production. Buffett's significant stake in Occidental, now representing north of 25% ownership of the company, reflects his confidence in the company's management and long-term energy market position in the Permian Basin, where OXY maintains around 40% lower production costs compared to industry averages. The company's robust free cash flow generation, exceeding $3 billion quarterly at current oil prices, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet that has reduced net debt by more than 50% since 2020, supports continued dividend growth and an aggressive share repurchase program targeting around 15% of market cap annually. Operating margins hover above 30%, significantly outpacing industry peers, while the return on capital employed remains north of 20%. OXY's leadership in carbon capture technology, with over $5 billion committed to direct air capture facilities and enhanced oil recovery methods yielding around 25% higher recovery rates than conventional methods, provides substantial competitive advantages in an increasingly environmentally conscious industry. The company's carbon management business is projected to contribute north of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2027, while its enhanced oil recovery techniques reduce carbon intensity by approximately 20% compared to traditional extraction methods. OXY maintains significant financial flexibility even in challenging price environments with a breakeven price below $40 per barrel and operating costs in the lowest quartile of global producers. Moody's is a leading global integrated risk assessment firm, providing credit ratings, research, tools and analysis that contribute to transparent financial markets. The company's analytics division has expanded significantly, offering software solutions for risk management, financial analysis, and regulatory compliance. Recent acquisitions have strengthened its position in ESG and climate risk assessment. Moody's exemplifies Buffett's preference for companies with wide economic moats and predictable earnings, demonstrated by its industry-leading operating margins of just under 50% and return on equity in the 70-80% range. The company's oligopolistic market position in credit ratings, with a 32% global market share, coupled with high entry barriers and strong recurring revenue from its analytics business – which now accounts for over 30% of total revenue and grew by over 15% year-over-year – creates a powerful competitive advantage. The analytics division's recurring revenue model has pushed contract renewal rates to north of 90%, while the average contract value has increased by double digits annually over the past three years. Growing demand for risk assessment tools and ESG analytics, evidenced by 35% + growth in ESG-related revenues and a pipeline of (over $2.5 billion) in potential analytics contracts, provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining high margins. The company's asset-light business model generates exceptional free cash flow conversion of over 75% of net income, supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term investors in 2025. Each company possesses the characteristics Buffett values: strong competitive positions, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent cash flows. From Bank of America's financial strength to Apple's ecosystem dominance, and from Coca-Cola's brand power to Occidental's energy leadership and Moody's market dominance, these selections offer a diversified approach to value investing aligned with Buffett's time-tested principles. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies appear well-positioned to deliver sustainable returns in the years ahead.

Warren Buffett added one new stock to Berkshire Hathaway's publicly-traded equity portfolio, while ... [+] eliminating three holdings. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) fourth-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on Valentine’s Day, February 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the U.S. publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s fourth-quarter earnings report, containing Warren Buffett’s annual letter and information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, is expected on Saturday, February 22. Berkshire’s $267 billion investment portfolio consists of 38 companies, down two from last quarter. Berkshire was likely a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for almost 71% of the total portfolio, down from 76% in the first quarter. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with nearly 90% of assets in the top ten holdings. Percent Of Berkshire Hathaway's $267 Billion Portfolio: 38 Total Holdings Notably, Berkshire stopped paring their Apple (AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines. Holdings By Sector Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned. Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies. Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX). This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield. Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies. I am a long-time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.
