For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal In its 14th round of disposals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. eclipsed $10 billion of total proceeds from whittling its stake in the second-largest US bank, a regulatory filing on Monday shows. Buffett, 94, began paring the massive investment in mid-July, putting pressure on the stock’s price ever since. In the latest batch, Berkshire reaped $383 million over three trading days, as it unloaded fewer shares than in many previous rounds. Buffett’s selling has tended to trickle off when the stock’s price falls toward $39, his company’s filings show. The shares closed at $39.96 on Monday. Berkshire’s remaining 10.1% stake is worth about $31.4 billion at that price. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.
