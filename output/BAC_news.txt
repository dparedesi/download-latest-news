KanawatTH/iStock via Getty Images KanawatTH/iStock via Getty Images The main event for the fund this quarter was the favorable antitrust ruling for Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL)âs Google. A federal judge had earlier this year deemed Google a monopoly that unfairly used its position to stifle competition, and for prospective penalties, the US Department of Justice petitioned the court for a number of changes to Googleâs business, including banning the payments that Google makes to Apple (AAPL) to be the default search option, divesting its Chrome browser and Android operating system, and sharing aspects of its search algorithm with competitors. The judge decided to mandate some limited sharing of search data, but for the most part, did not implement the harsher penalties, leaving Googleâs core search business essentially intact. The jump in Alphabetâs shares added 3.1% to the fund this quarter. After a miserable start to the year, UnitedHealthâwhose stock at one point had fallen by over 60% from its November 2024 highârebounded a bit, adding 0.9% to the fund, and we added to our position during the quarter. Investors were encouraged by the new CEOâs optimistic comments and by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) initiating a position in the company. AutoZone (AZO) added 1.0% and TJX 0.8% on strong retail results. Progressive was the largest detractor in the quarter, taking 0.5% from performance, as investors anticipated that lower interest rates would reduce its investment income. Ratings agencies S&P Global (SPGI) and Moodyâs (MCO) took off 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, while Visa (V) took off 0.2%. Total Returns as of September 30, 2025 (A) 1 Year, 3 Years, 5 Years, 10 Years, and Since Inception returns include change in share prices and, in each case, include reinvestment of any dividends and capital gain distributions. The inception date of the Bretton Fund was September 30, 2010. (B) The S&P 500Â® Index is a broad-based stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the US stock market, as determined by Standard & Poorâs, and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization. Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investorâs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. You may obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at here or by calling 800.231.2901. All returns include change in share prices, reinvestment of any dividends, and capital gains distributions. The index shown is a broad-based, unmanaged index commonly used to measure performance of US stocks. The index does not incur expenses and is not available for investment. The fundâs expense ratio is 1.35%. Portfolio as of September 30, 2025 *Cash represents cash equivalents less liabilities in excess of other assets. After purchasing Union Pacific Corp (UNP). almost 15 years ago and holding shares since the fundâs inception, we sold out of our position, collecting a 13% annualized internal rate of return along the way. For the most part, our investment thesis on Union Pacific played out: they had excellent pricing power from being in a mature duopoly, the decline in coal volume was offset by taking volume away from trucking, and they were able to increase margins through operational improvements. Growth slowed in recent years as inflation bit into margins and pricing gains slowed, but the fundamentals are still there for an attractive long-term business. We sold because of their pending acquisition of Norfolk Southern (NSC), which would create a railroad that spans the continental US. The operational rationale is compelling: creating a coast-to-coast railroad would enable them to ship freight in a straight shot across the country without having to stop and interchange cars somewhere in the middle. But we felt the heady deal price was too dilutive to shareholders, and the long, drawn-outâand inevitably uncertainâregulatory approval process would be a major distraction from the core business, which could use managementâs focus at the moment. It was a good run, and it was time to move on. As always, thank you for investing. Stephen Dodson, Portfolio Manager Raphael de Balmann, Portfolio Manager The fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained here or by calling 800.231.2901. Read it carefully before investing. An investment in the fund is subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal amount invested. There can be no assurance that the fund will be successful in meeting its objectives. The fund invests in common stocks which subjects investors to market risk. The fund invests in small and micro-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The fund invests in undervalued securities. Undervalued securities are, by definition, out of favor with investors, and there is no way to predict when, if ever, the securities may return to favor. The fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. More information about these risks and other risks can be found in the fundâs prospectus. The fund is a nondiversified fund and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a more diversified investment.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 If any investor has stood the test of time, it’s Warren Buffett, and with good reason. For years, the Oracle of Omaha has had a rock-star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting draws thousands of loyal investor fans. Buffett remains one of the world’s most prominent investors, known for his long buy-and-hold strategies and massive portfolio of public and private holdings. Long-time investors and Buffett mavens are familiar with this quote, “His favorite holding for an S&P 500 stock is forever.” So it is not surprising to report that for all of the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, three top companies make up over 50% of the fund’s total holdings. While much more concentrated than most portfolio managers would ever consider, the strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway investors for years and likely will in the future. Here are the three companies that are over 50% of Berkshire Hathaway. Paul Morigi / Getty Images There are few investors with the results and reputation Buffett has garnered over the past 50 years.

It is almost hard to comprehend that the legacy technology giant, with 280 million shares, still makes up a stunning 23.2% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which holds almost 2% of Apple’s stock even after selling tens of millions of shares over the last few years. Apple designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories, and sells a variety of related services.

Still, it makes up 10.2% of the portfolio. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) is a bank holding company and a financial holding company that posted huge third-quarter results. Earnings per share of $1.06 versus $0.95, as revenue of $28.24 billion versus $27.5 billion beat analysts’ estimates.
