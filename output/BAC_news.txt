Investing Stocks rallied for the second straight day, as the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 both print new all-time highs. Positive economic and single-stock news, along with anticipation of strong fourth-quarter earnings, helped drive stocks higher on Tuesday. With technology still being the wind in the markets’ sails, we could see more new all-time highs as the week rolls on. Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com The futures are trading flat on Wednesday after a second strong day for Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high, closing over $49,000 for the first time at $49,484, up a solid 1.04%. The S&P 500 also posted a record high, closing at 6,947, up 0.66%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also scored a win on Tuesday, closing the day at 23,546, up 0.64%. Continued momentum from Monday carried stocks higher, plus solid economic news on multiple fronts also added to the bullish sentiment. Semiconductor stocks are still leading the technology charge, and many feel the top companies could post outstanding fourth-quarter earnings, which will start next week with the big money-center banks reporting. Plus, after hitting a wall at the end of 2025, AI and data center stocks have shown renewed momentum as investors chase more big gains in 2026. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve after a solid start to the week on Monday. While buying was seen in the shorter T-bill maturities, there was some modest selling across the middle and longer maturities. Investors are clearly focused on upcoming economic data and geopolitical events, such as developments in Venezuela. However, recent market shifts saw yields dip amid broader Fed uncertainty and tech bubble fears, creating a volatile environment for safe-haven assets. The 30-year long bond was last seen Tuesday at 4.85% while the benchmark ten-year note finished the day at 4.17% After a solid Monday, stocks were down across the energy complex, and some of the same worries from 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday as expectations of a global supply surplus in 2026 and the lack of immediate supply disruption from geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, as Chevron reported that it will keep Venezuelan oil flowing despite the political upheaval there. Traders are focused on market fundamentals, which point to ample supply and subdued demand concerns. Brent Crude closed at $60.49, down 2.06%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.91, down 2.42%. Natural gas also saw sellers reappear, as unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country was a factor. Nat gas closed at $3.40, down 3.43%. Gold and Silver continued their respective marches higher, albeit not as dramatically for Gold as some of the trading days we have seen recently, when both precious metals would bolt higher by 5-10% and more. The song remains the same as central bank buying, massive retail inflows, and geopolitical concerns continue to drive investors to chase both Gold and Silver. Gold closed the session up almost 1% at $4,492. However, Silver continued a hot streak, closing up 6.06% at $81.18. Crypto markets traded mixed on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin pulled back slightly but generally held above the $91,000 to $92,000 range, while some altcoins like XRP and Solana posted notable gains. Many crypto analysts on Wall Street are starting to signal they feel the bottom after a sizable sell-off that began last year may be in the process of being put in. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $91,940, while Ethereum was trading at $3,212. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Investing While Berkshire Hathaway has produced double-digit gains over the past 10 years, the investment gain underperformed the S&P 500 in 2025. With almost 50% of Berkshire Hathaway in just three stocks, it will be interesting to see how new CEO Greg Abel moves foward in 2026 and beyond. With a stunning $381 billion in cash and short-term T-bills, Abel has the most dry powder that Berkshire Hathaway has ever amassed. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Paul Morigi / Getty Images If any investor has stood the test of time, it is Warren Buffett, and with good reason. For 60 years, the “Oracle of Omaha” had a rock-star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) shareholders meeting drew thousands of loyal investors. They were stunned at last year’s meeting when Buffett announced that he would step down as CEO of the investment giant at year’s end. While he remains board chair and vows to come to the office every day, he will also continue to have a voice in the day-to-day operations. His pre-announced successor and long-time lieutenant, Greg Abel, has assumed the CEO position and will likely direct or have a say in most, if not all, new investments, public or private. Long-time investors and Buffett mavens know that his favorite holding for an S&P 500 stock is forever, so it’s not surprising to report that for all the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, only three top companies make up almost 50% of the fund’s total holdings. While much more concentrated than most portfolio managers would ever consider, the strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway investors for years and will likely continue to do so. The question for investors is whether Abel will remain comfortable with the fund’s equity allocation to just three companies. In addition, for years, Wall Street has urged Buffett to pay dividends to shareholders, as Berkshire Hathaway, according to recent reports, earns approximately $4.37 billion annually in dividend income from its stock portfolio. This income comes from the dividend-paying stocks that Buffett and his team have accumulated over the decades. Whether Abel will be able to persuade Buffett to change the dividend policy remains a wild card issue. Berkshire Hathaway has a long history of beating the market. Over the past 20 years, it has delivered an average annual return of 12.1%, compared to the S&P 500’s 11.5%. It is essential to note that Berkshire Hathaway holds significant stakes in numerous well-known private companies, including Acme Brick, Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, GEICO, and Lubrizol. Investors who still believe the path forward for Berkshire Hathaway will be optimistic should consider buying shares below $500, which is right in the middle of the 52-week trading range. Here are the three companies that make up almost 50% of Berkshire Hathaway. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) is an American bank holding company and multinational financial services corporation specializing in payment cards. This stock has performed strongly in 2025, offering a dividend yield of 0.86%. American Express is a globally integrated payments company that deals with card-issuing, merchant-acquiring, and card network businesses. The financial giant posted strong third-quarter earnings per share of $4.14, exceeding analyst expectations of $3.99, representing a 19% year-over-year increase. Revenue grew 11% to $18.43 billion, surpassing the forecast of $18.05 billion. Net income increased 16%, to $2.9 billion, compared to last year. The company offers products and services to customers worldwide, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies, and large corporations. Its segments include: Berkshire Hathaway owns 151,610,700 shares, 22% of American Express’s float and 17.9% of the portfolio. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating with a $425 target price. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It also offers a small dividend of 0.38%. It is almost hard to comprehend that the legacy technology giant, even after a recent sale of 20 million shares and a surge in sales over the past two years, still makes up a stunning 20.5% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which holds 1.6% of Apple’s stock. The company offers: Apple also offers AppleCare support and cloud services, and operates various platforms, including the App Store, which enables customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, videos, games, and podcasts. In addition, the company offers various services, such as: Citigroup has a Buy rating with a $330 target price. While Buffett trimmed the position over the past two years, this quality financial giant remains an exceptional long-term holding with a solid 1.89% dividend yield. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) is a bank holding company and financial holding company that reported impressive Q3 results. Earnings per share of $1.06 vs. $0.95, as revenue of $28.24 billion vs. $27.5 billion beat analysts’ estimates. Profit rose 23% from a year earlier to $8.5 billion, and revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with EPS jumping 31%. Berkshire Hathaway owns 568,070,012 shares, which is 10% of the portfolio and 7.8% of the float. Its segments include: Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and a $68 target price.
