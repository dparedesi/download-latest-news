Hims & Hers (HIMS-8.47%) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced new weight-loss drug offerings — an update that left investors unimpressed. Shares of the digital healthcare platform, which caters to millennials, fell as much as 6.8% before rebounding. The stock then dipped more than 4% in after-hours trading. The selloff followed Hims & Hers’ announcement that it had added Eli Lilly’s (LLY-5.80%) popular weight-loss drug Zepbound and a generic GLP-1 medication to its platform. The news comes in response to a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-6.47%) Ozempic and Wegovy — from the agency’s shortage list. As a result, Hims & Hers will soon have to limit its previous offerings of the drug. Last May, the company began selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic — starting at $199 a month. That helped drive the company’s total revenue up 69% last year, reaching $1.5 billion. But now that the drug is no longer in short supply, Hims & Hers will only be able to sell personalized and clinically necessary formulations of compounded semaglutide in order to comply with current drug regulations. The company’s newest offerings come with a steep price tag: Zepbound costs $1,899 a month, while its generic liraglutide is priced at $299 a month, according to the company’s website. Wall Street hasn’t been enthusiastic about at least one of these new options. “We view HIMS’ decision to sell branded tirzepatide as a way to provide more options to consumers, but would expect volume and revenue to be immaterial — even over an extended period of time,” Bank of America (BAC-7.64%) analyst Allen Lutz wrote in a note Tuesday. “We find it incredibly unlikely a consumer would go to HIMS to buy any branded GLP-1 for $1,899/month.” Instead, analysts are waiting to see on how well the company’s generic liraglutide performs. Hims & Hers first announced plans in November to introduce a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight-loss drug, this year. Unlike newer options that require weekly injections, liraglutide is taken daily. It is currently sold under Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda brand, though many of its patents have expired. In a 56-week clinical trial, patients taking the once-daily injection lost more than 5% of their body weight on average. By comparison, those taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s weekly-injectable Zepbound lost more than 20% of their weight after 72 weeks in clinical trials. “We think monitoring HIMS’ liraglutide launch will be relevant over the next year,” Lutz wrote. “If HIMS is able to generate commercial success for liraglutide, it would represent a significant milestone and validate the strength of HIMS’ brand, in our view.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. Dividend investing does not have to be intimidating or complicated. It only takes some quick learning and a few easy steps to start building your passive dividend income stream. Dividend investing can be fun and financially rewarding. The fun happens when dividend payments hit your account every quarter or month. The financial rewards—which are ongoing—include two forms of returns, rising income and low volatility. Dividend-paying securities provide cash income plus appreciation potential. Together, earned dividends and price gains comprise your total return. Total return is an important metric for comparing dividend-payers to securities that don’t pay dividends. Dividend-paying securities often produce lower total returns than growth stocks. This makes sense because their risk is lower. With a dividend payer, the income is yours once it lands in your account. It cannot be rescinded, and you can use the cash to reinvest. Many growth securities do not pay dividends. They only provide appreciation gains which you earn when their price rises. Those gains are not permanent and can change quickly if the stock price falls. Some dividend securities provide ongoing income that rises over time. Rising income is a valuable offset to inflation, particularly in retirement—when you don’t have the opportunity to get a raise at work. Dividend stocks are categorized by how many consecutive years they have raised their shareholder payouts: These companies can cancel or reduce their dividend at any point, so their current status does not guarantee future income. Therefore, diversification is important. When your income portfolio is diversified, you are less dependent on one company’s dividend policy. Not every company can pay dividends consistently for decades. This achievement requires: These same qualities encourage low stock-price volatility and relatively consistent earnings. This is why some of the best dividend-paying stocks are blue-chip companies. Blue-chip describes large, financially strong companies with recognizable brand names such as Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM) and Walmart (WMT). Even if you’ve never invested before, you can start dividend investing in four simple steps. You’ll choose an account, pick your asset type, invest and automate. Earned dividends are taxable, even if you reinvest them. Many domestic stocks pay qualified dividends, which are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Nonqualified dividends are taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rate. You can defer the annual federal tax obligation by holding your dividend payers in a tax-advantaged account. 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs and 529 plans provide tax deferrals on investment earnings. Tax-advantaged accounts have withdrawal restrictions, which can be good or bad depending on your goals. If you are investing to build retirement income, then it makes sense to hold dividend securities in an IRA or 401(k). If you prefer to access the income sooner than retirement, a regular brokerage account or direct investment with the company will do. In this case, remember to plan for a higher tax bill each year. Next, you will pick which types of security you prefer. This may be an easy choice if you invest in a 401(k) with limited investment options. In accounts with broad access to publicly traded securities, you can choose from individual stocks, REITs and funds. Stocks Stocks are ownership shares of publicly traded companies. The dividend payments represent your share of profits. REITs REIT stands for real estate investment trust. These entities own and manage real estate. Special tax treatment requires REITs to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. Funds Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) are investment portfolios that sell shares. As a fund shareholder, you earn when the portfolio produces income or increases in value. Many funds focus on dividend-paying securities to provide income for their shareholders. Examples include Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV). There are also REIT funds, such as iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) and SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR). Next, you will research your options and place your first trade order. You can prepare for this step by deciding whether to prioritize dividend yield or income consistency. Dividend yield measures income efficiency. It is calculated as the annual dividend payment divided by the share price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a blue-chip index, pays an average dividend yield of 1.82%. Some stocks and REITs pay much higher yields, but the payments may vary over time. If you are not yet comfortable analyzing a stock or REIT's yield, dividend track record and financial health, opt for a fund with a low expense ratio and 100 or more securities in its portfolio. Consistent, recurring investments help you grow your dividend portfolio and income potential faster. Consider setting a monthly investing budget and automating those trades in your investment account. You can also reinvest your dividend payments automatically. This allows you to raise your income potential through compounding, which happens when your investment earnings generate more earnings. Many brokerage accounts allow for automatic dividend reinvestment. If yours doesn't, look for stocks or funds that offer direct investment and free dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP). Direct stock purchase plans are managed through the company rather than a broker. They may have lower fees than brokerage accounts, but the shares can be harder to sell. Computershare is a good resource for researching DRIPs. With the right investments, your dividend program can be low-maintenance and self-propelling. Opt for stocks or REITs with long and consistent dividend track records and low-fee funds emphasizing dividend reliability. Invest often, reinvest your dividends and watch your income potential grow over time.
