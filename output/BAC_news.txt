Title: Bully For Investment Banks!

By Sean Ring PostedOctober 17, 2025 I remember getting my offer letter from Lehman Brothers in early 1997, a full 11 years before they went bankrupt, I hasten to add. For a whopping $34,000, I was theirs, green as a Granny Smith apple. My job was in a division called Global Corporate Equity Derivatives, and I was going to help the traders keep their trading books reconciled with the general ledger. It was my first, and last, accounting job, and it sucked from Day 1. But I didn’t know that, so I leaped with glee into my family’s New Jersey living room, and yelped, “Ma, I got the job!” My mother squealed, “I’m soooo proud of you!” And then she paused. “I always wondered how those banks made all that money.” I had no idea because my undergraduate macroeconomic classes were a heaping mess of Keynesian nonsense. They failed to mention things like money printing, interbank lending, and bailouts. I was about to get the education of my life. I remembered this episode fondly as I read that every major U.S. bank beat earnings estimates this quarter. JPM, MS, WFC, BAC, and GS shot the lights out. But the reasons why are no longer a mystery. After you read this piece, it won’t be a mystery to you, either. Sure, the Rothbardian reason that banks are closest to the money printer is still valid, perhaps more now than ever. And yes, during good times, CEOs idiotically decide to acquire or merge with another company in transactions that make money for white-shoed investment bankers, but not their shareholders. During bull markets, it’s almost impossible for banks’ sales and trading teams to lose money. That’s not even their doing. It’s their clients —the pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowment funds, and other asset managers—who want to hedge their bets. I’ll explain. Investment banks (the sell side) service asset managers, or the buy side. The buy-side is the people who take all of our assets and buy stuff, like stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. Asset managers are buyers of mammoth amounts of stock. That means they are constantly long. Of course, if they’re long, they always want the market to go up. And, yes, that is, for the most part, true. But we must keep two things in mind, only one of which is obvious. The obvious one is they don’t want violent downward moves, like the March 2020 Covid crash. The not-so-obvious point is that they also don’t tend to want the market to move too violently upwards, either. It’s like “quality of earnings.” A nice, steady increase is good enough for most of them. Of course, TSLA quadrupling is just fine and dandy. But asset managers would’ve certainly been at least partially hedged. So asset managers do two things to combat a precipitous fall or to prepare for a “sideways move” in the stock. Here they are: An asset manager will go to their investment banks and say to them, “Listen, I’m long this stock that has, say, appreciated 40% in the past year. I need to hold on to it because it’s part of my investment plan, but I’m worried about the downside. Can I please buy a put from you?” When you take a long stock position and combine it with a long put position, you have what’s called portfolio protection. It synthetically creates a long call option on the stock. This means you’re still exposed to the upside, which is great, but you no longer have any downside. The asset manager eliminated that downside by paying the option premium. The second scenario is this: a fund manager may be forced to own a stock that is not particularly good—a dog, in asset management parlance—a stock that hasn’t moved up in many years and doesn’t pay the best dividend in the world. But they have to hold it because it’s a part of their index or basket. So what fund managers often do is sell call options against those stocks. They are what we call covered call positions, and, synthetically, they are short puts. The asset manager will do this for a few reasons: If you’ve got fund managers who are both long puts and short calls, who are long those calls and short those puts? The investment banks are. They facilitate this trade, so they are synthetically long the stock market. How is that? The investment banks are the ones who buy the calls from the fund managers and sell the puts to the fund managers. A long call plus a short put is equal to a long stock position. We call this an “ax.” Who are the two most prominent investment banks in the United States? Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, occasionally known as Government Sachs. Other universal banks like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Bank of America also participate. Now you can see why there is an implied upward bias in the markets. And, of course, vested interests don’t want the markets to come down. This gives credence to rumors of a plunge protection scheme and the “Fed put” that Alan Greenspan was famous for. BTFD takes on new meaning when you understand this state of affairs. But if you are someone who doesn’t have many assets yet, you’re waiting to get in on the action. And waiting, and waiting… You haven’t been exposed to the natural price deflation seen in economic cycles because banks, asset managers, the government, and the media have done their level best to eliminate deflation altogether. Guido Hülsmann, in his masterful essay Deflation and Liberty (page 26), gives us the exact reason why the vested interests will not yield to price depreciation: There is only one fundamental change that deflation brings about. It radically modifies the structure of ownership. Firms financed per credits go bankrupt because at the lower level of prices they can no longer pay back the credits they had incurred without anticipating the deflation. Private households with mortgages and other considerable debts to pay back go bankrupt, because with the decline of money prices their monetary income declines too whereas their debts remain at the nominal level. The very attempt to liquidate assets to pay back debt entails a further reduction of the value of those assets, thus making it even more difficult for them to come even with their creditors. The game may be rigged, but all you have to do to benefit like the banks is get long the market and stay long. Until the market finally, mercifully, turns.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday afternoon in the wake of strong bank earnings and indications of more Federal Reserve rate cuts ahead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow were all higher. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged, leading broader gains for semiconductor companies a day after the chipmaker announced a deal to sell chips to Oracle (ORCL). Also helping lift semiconductor stocks was an update from chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML), which said AI-driven demand was strong. Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) gained after both financial firms reported better-than-expected results on booming investment banking revenue. Bunge Global (BG) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as the soybean exporter stands to benefit from soybean trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Progressive (PGR) shares slumped after the insurer reported its combined ratio rose on higher costs. Shares of F5 (FFIV) also dropped after the cloud services firm reported a cyberattack by government hackers. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) shares declined after the drugmaker cut the top end of its earnings guidance on concerns about the impact of tariffs. Gold price climbed to a fresh high, while oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.
