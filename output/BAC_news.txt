Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year. And the firm’s steady exposure to American Express comes despite a years-long departure from the US banking sector and a multi billion-dollar exodus from positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Buffett has held American Express stock since the mid 90’s and has said he’ll never sell it, touting its strong brand, loyal customer base, wide economic moat and consistent profitability. As Buffett continues to sell Bank of America shares, BAC now sits in the number three position in Berkshire’s portfolio, with about $35 billion invested, representing 11.7% of the portfolio. Overall, Buffett continues to exercise caution in the markets, with Berkshire now sitting on $325 billion in cash and equivalents, nearly double the amount at the end of 2023. Berkshire has about $300 billion invested – here’s a look at the firm’s top 10 positions at time of publishing.

Title: Tesla stock's post-election boom just powered the shares to an all-time high

Tesla stock beat its previous all-time high Wednesday, as investors and analysts foresee major gains from self-driving vehicles, robots, and CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with the next president. The stock has been a tear over the last month after Donald Trump won the presidential election, aided by Musk’s generous spending. The stock climbed to a new record of $424.88 per share before closing at $424.77 on Wednesday. In pre-market trading Thursday, the stock is slightly up, bringing the price to almost $426 a pop. The previous record for intraday trading was $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. Trading closed that day at $409.97, which was the stock’s split-adjusted all-time closing high. “As foretold in the prophecy, Musk wrote in a post on his X Wednesday afternoon as the stock hit $420 a share. In 2018, he said he was considering taking Tesla private at that price, which is a marijuana reference. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. But Tesla will likely face a hit in sales if the credits are nixed and the company’s technology isn’t ready to take advantage of eased regulatory changes concerning driverless cars, according to experts. Tesla has also benefitted from a number of positive analyst reactions to the stock surge, with many raising their price targets. Morgan Stanley’s (MS+0.84%) Adam Jonas joined the party on Tuesday, adding Tesla as a “top pick” and raising the firm’s price target to $400 per share from $310. He warned that killing the EV tax credit could slow adoption and that “higher competition with tariff hikes are an inflationary wild-card.” Goldman Sachs (GS-0.73%) on Wednesday raised its price target to $345 from $250, noting that it expects Tesla to face near-to-medium term headwinds to its auto businesses. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Andres Sheppard raised the firm’s price target to $365 per share from $255, citing bullishness on Tesla’s robotaxi plans and a potential federal framework for self-driving vehicles. Bank of America (BAC-0.62%) analysts, who raised their price target to $400 per share from $350, pointed to a recent visit to Tesla’s Texas factory, which gave them “increased confidence” in Tesla’s core EV businesses and the Optimus humanoid robots. Musk has been forecasting an eventual price of $250,00 to $30,000 per robot, as well as a long-term scenario where they add $20 trillion to the company’s market capitalization. Tesla’s market capitalization was almost $1.3 trillion as of Wednesday. Wall Street analysts are “tripping over each other” to raise their price targets, wrote The Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black on Tuesday, pointing to a chart showing that the average price target is still $260 per share. “How does a highly paid WS sales team get on the phone and tell clients to buy a stock with little or no upside?” He also raised his price target — to $380 per share from $300 — on Monday, citing his “increased conviction” that Tesla will launch an affordable electric hatchback in 2025. While some analysts have expressed caution over aspects of Tesla’s business, others have gone a bit further to dampen investors’ enthusiasm. UBS (UBS-0.22%) analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a report late last month that the rise is “mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history).” The company’s stock has repeatedly been criticized for behaving like a meme stock, given Musk’s massive influence over Tesla influencers and retail investors. In the past, analysts have even noted that they have “painfully” discovered that memes shared on Reddit can affect the stock more than actual financial metrics.

Title: Opportunity For Wells Fargo Stock If The Asset Cap Is Lifted?

Wells Fargo in Washington D.C. in the United States of America, on July 12th, 2024. (Photo by Beata ... [+] Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Wells Fargo’s stock (NYSE: WFC) has gained close to 51% year-to-date, as compared to the 28% rise in the S&P 500 index over the same period. In comparison, Wells Fargo’s peer, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), is up 42% year-to-date. So what are some of the factors driving WFC stock higher this year, and what lies ahead for the company? While Wells Fargo has seen a strong performance this year, its performance has been mixed in the recent past. Returns for the stock were 61% in 2021, -12% in 2022, and 23% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Recent Financial Performance Wells Fargo reported better-than-expected results for Q3 2024, with total revenues at $20.4 billion, down about 2% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to an 11% drop in net interest income, which the bank has attributed to higher funding costs as customers have migrated to higher-yielding deposit products. Net profits also fell 11% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, due to lower net interest income. That said, the company has been diversifying its revenue sources. Non-interest-related income was up 12% year-over-year during Q3. The wealth and investment management segment performed particularly well, posting a 13% increase in non-interest revenue, driven by higher asset-based fees from higher market valuations as well as increased brokerage transaction activity. The bank also said that its fee-based revenue expanded 16% during the first nine months of the year. Lifting of Asset Cap On Cards? Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve going forward driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Wells Fargo. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Wells Fargo, in particular, could stand to benefit if regulators ease the $1.95 trillion asset cap that was imposed upon the bank in 2018 following its fake account scandal. The cap had made the company scale back on lending and taking deposits, putting it well behind counterparts such as JPMorgan Chase, which now has over $4 trillion in assets, and Citi whose assets total close to $2.4 trillion. Following the scandal, Wells Fargo tweaked its strategy focusing on higher-return businesses as well as less capital-intensive businesses like investment banking. Easing the cap could help the company grow its balance sheet and earnings after years of being constrained. We value Wells Fargo stock at about $67 per share which is slightly below the current market price.
