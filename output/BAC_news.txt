I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this).

And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. 79% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost thirty percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Thursday, with the major indexes struggling to build on the previous day's surge amid another round of big bank earnings. Investors also watched as the Senate hearing kicked off for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1%. Markets are coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. Also taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation. Topics investors were watching to surface during the gathering include tariff policies and debt concerns amid Republican initiatives for 2025 tax and spending plans. Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury Secretary highlighted an opportunity for a new 'Golden Age' for the US during opening remarks at his confirmation hearing. "Today, I believe that President Trump has a generational opportunity to unleash a new economic Golden Age that will create more jobs, wealth, and prosperity for all Americans," Bessent told lawmakers on Thursday morning. The nominee highlighted his life's work in the private sector has given him a understanding of the economy and markets. "Having never served in government, I intend if confirmed, to be in close contact with each of you and your offices, and seek your council," said Bessent. He also highlighted the need for the government to ensure the US Dollar remains the world's reserve currency. Lawmakers were making opening remarks on Thursday morning at the confirmation hearing for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The hearing is likely to last about two and a half hours. Likely topics Bessent will face questions on include policies surrounding tariffs, and Republican initiatives for 2025 tax initiatives and spending plans. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, will face questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill today starting at 10:30 a.m ET. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports on two issues to watch for during the hearing which have come into focus this week. One is around a swirl of seemingly competing tariff plans before President-elect Donald Trump, some of which Bessent himself is reportedly pushing. A second is whether Republicans will be able to ignore debt concerns and go big with their 2025 tax and spending plans. Read more here. Builders are starting the year with more optimism than in the end of 2024, despite elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 47 in January, up one point from December and higher than economists’ estimates of 45, per Bloomberg data. Still, a reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. The dilemma of high housing costs persists, with mortgage rates hovering closer to 7% over the past four consecutive weeks, according to Freddie Mac. Markets expect the Fed will likely leave rates unchanged this month, especially after fresh inflation data released Wednesday showed some signs of easing. The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates but its actions influence the direction of yields, which in turn affect borrowing costs. The NAHB survey showed builders continue to offer concessions in January. The survey found that 60% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, while 30% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in January. The average price reduction was 5%, matching December’s price cut. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here. Good chart by the Vanda Research team looking at Mag 7 flows from the retail trading community. You can see activity having slowed down in January with names like Nvidia under pressure.

Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT).
