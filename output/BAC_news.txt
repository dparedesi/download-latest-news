AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), now a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, briefly touched a new high earlier in the session but later slipped below the flatline. Other notable movers touching all-time highs include the S&P 500's Industrials Sector ETF (XLI) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed to new highs on Friday, surpassing the 44,000 level for the first time ever. Chip stocks initially soared on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s win and the Fed’s latest rate cut.

Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 1.1%, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 1.4%, Arm (ARM) sank 3.5% while AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU) fell less than 1%.

The industry is broadly braced for another round of restrictions on the supply of chips and equipment to China,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts wrote Friday. "Trump's win was clearly the key event this week, and many semiconductor stocks, esp semicaps, are likely to trade sideways till there is clarity on further restrictions, tariffs, and Chips Act funding," Jefferies said. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $76,000 on Friday as the risk-on rally post Donald Trump's White House win was on pace to end the week on a high note. The cryptocurrency spiked to new highs on Wednesday following the presidential election results. Trump was a supporter of bitcoin during his campaign, advocating for the creation of a national crypto stockpile if elected to the White House. Chinese stocks fell on Friday, dragging on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which hovered near the flatline. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus sent shares of Chinese tech stocks lower. The recently announced $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur the economy. E-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 6% while PDD Holdings (PDD) also dropped 6%. Earlier this week the sector fell over concerns of potential tariffs after Donald Trump won the presidential election.

Quarterly earnings per share of $2.13 missed Wall Street’s forecast of $2.15, and revenue of $3.73 billion came in ahead of the $3.72 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post maintained his Neutral rating on the stock, raising his near-term estimates for bookings over the next year but lowering his 2025 earnings growth outlook. “While Airbnb is expanding its geographic reach, and has a number of new growth initiatives to help to capitalize on its large bookings ecosystem, core nights growth is in line with peers and the margin growth seems less likely in 2025,” Post said. He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results. US stocks flirted with their record highs on Friday following the latest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average.

By Daniel Urbina Summary Over the recent months, Bank of America (BAC, Financial) has been in the headlines as legendary investor Warren Buffett sold many of his shares in the North Carolinian bank. With this, Buffett owns less than 10% of the company, allowing him to refrain from reporting his stock transactions from now on. Should retail investors blindly follow Buffett's actions and avoid initiating a position or trimming positions in Bank of America's stock? The answer is no. First, Buffett has many potential reasons to sell the stock, and multiple bearish transactions do not constitute a pessimistic outlook on the stock alone. For example, the sale could be attributed to a portfolio rebalancing. Second, when observing Berkshire's positions, Bank of America represents the second largest holding, and one can't be bearish on a company while holding more than $40 billion in it. Setting Buffett aside, let me explain why Bank of America's current landscape represents an opportunity for investors to be bullish on the stock. The primary source of income for money center banks is usually net interest income from consumer banking, which is what banks earn from lending products after paying depositors and wholesale funders. In Q1 of 2022, a hawkish Fed allowed banks to increase their net interest income as loan demand was still high, and the yields earned were generally higher. Nonetheless, this only lasted for part of the rate hike period as higher interest rates began to make loan originations less appealing. In addition, depositors found money market yields attractive and shifted sight deposits towards term deposits, which are a more expensive funding source for banks. This condition ultimately translated into lower gains from net interest income, and Bank of America wasn't the exception. As illustrated above, the net interest income from the Bank of America Consumer Banking segment began to fall sequentially from Q1 of 2023. Yet, after the Fed's first rate cut, the most recent quarter finally saw a net interest income gain after multiple consecutive drops. With a dovish monetary policy, Bank of America is in an excellent spot to call Q2 of 2024 the net interest income trough and substantially gain from these tailwinds in 2025. Let me explain why. In addition, since the FED's first rate cut in September, the yield curve has steepened as longer-term yields have gained roughly 105 bps. This bull steepener is the best macro scenario for a bank as there are more opportunities for maturity transformation as banks can borrow cheaper on short maturities and lend at higher rates in longer maturities. It is worth mentioning that management had been expecting a net interest income recovery in Q3 of 2024 for over a year. Surprisingly, they hit the estimate at the exact time they expected it. Regarding that, Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan had this to say in the most recent earnings call. "Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four." Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO. Furthermore, during the conference call, management remained optimistic about the bank's net interest income trajectory and called for a sequential rise once again in Q4 of 2024. "With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow" Alastair Borthwick, CFO. Money center banks such as Bank of America are heavily diversified. Although net interest income tends to be their main source of revenue, other non-interest income, such as investment banking, trading, wealth and asset management, are also factors for top-line growth. The bank has been doing well within these categories, particularly with trading and asset management, due to markets at an all-time high and significant corporate volume in trading activity. Despite investment banking having strongly recovered from 2022 lows, deal activity remains below historical averages, and rate cuts induce more volume within these areas of the bank. For example, with cheaper interest rates, banks are more likely to increase their leverage and conduct buyouts due to higher expected internal rates of return. Nevertheless, the initial 50 bps rate cut from the FED has yet to improve the landscape as long-term rates haven't fallen, and this activity is dependent on longer-term rates. Yet, the outlook for M&A and other investment banking activity is for volumes to increase to historical levels after a prolonged time of high interest rates. The most appalling part of a bullish investment thesis on Bank of America is its valuation. As commented, the bank sits at a potential turning point on its net interest income, and the outlook from the company's side is for the backdrop to improve. Nonetheless, the stock wouldn't be attractive if the bank traded at 3.00x price-to-tangible book value while exhibiting a return on average tangible common shareholders' equity of 12.8%. Luckily for investors, this is not the case. Based on the most recent price-to-tangible book value per share of $26.25 and a closing price of $42.62, Bank of America's stock trades at 1.62x price-to-tangible book, which is unarguably a decent valuation, considering that the 5-year average of the price-to-tangible book multiple is around the corner at 1.60x. Simultaneously, competitor JPMorgan (JPM) trades considerably higher at over 2.3x price-to-tangible book value. In addition, the dividend yield, at 2.30%, is also at its five-year average. With a dividend increase momentum, the current prices set an excellent opportunity for income investors who are seeking a safe and growing dividend despite the moderate value of the dividend yield. Bank of America Provision for Credit Losses Over the past quarters, the provisions for Bank of America's credit losses have increased slightly. Considering that the loan portfolio has stayed basically flat over the year, the bank's cost of risk has risen. Although the bank's asset quality remains resilient, things in the economy could always unfold. If a soft landing does not materialize, the bullish thesis on Bank of America is nullified due to a bank's dependence on economic and credit cycles. In addition, although the valuation remains high, the truth is like the sun; you can't hide it with just one finger. In this case, the stock has risen more than 60% over the past year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 and boosting optimism among investors. Usually, when market sentiment is high, reactions to negative news amplify, and the stock tends to drop more than it should. Yet, positive financials and high market sentiment are the formula for a stock to gain excess returns. To conclude, due to the net interest income recovery outlook, Bank of America's stock is well positioned to continue gaining solid market performances that appeal to investors. A fair valuation allows the stock to continue being attractive to investors despite the enormous price gain of the past year. Finally, investors shouldn't blindly follow actions from legendary investors, even more so when a bullish thesis is evident. Therefore, due to all these conditions, Bank of America is a stock that represents an opportunity in 2025. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.
