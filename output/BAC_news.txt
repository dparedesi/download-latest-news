BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 05: Elon Musk embraces Republican presidential nominee, former ... [+] President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on October 05, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The U.S. Presidential election is nearing its curtain call. And from the look of things, this is going to be yet another photo finish. If you think Trump's Make America Great Again campaign did enough to get him past the finishing line - and into the White House - for a second term, then here is a list of stocks that you could bet on to make the most of market movements in the near term. And, for the flip side, check out Harris Stocks: Promising Picks If Harris Wins. The stocks that we believe will benefit the most from Trump's return to office are: DJT is a no-brainer, since Trump is the majority shareholder in the company which operates the social media platform Truth Social. Admittedly, the stock has been extremely volatile over the last one year, with prices swinging between a low of $11.75 and a high of $79.38 over this period. While the stock has gained 75% so far this year, it fell more than 30% last week. The stock should see significant gains if Trump wins, but be prepared for more such wild swings till the result is locked in. Two more companies that are directly associated with Trump, and should see a big win with Trump. Rumble is an online video platform and cloud services business that hosts Truth Social, and Phunware is a mobile software company that provided campaign data and also built a reelection app for Trump in the past. While both stocks have been very volatile, like DJT, since the beginning of this year, trading activity in RUM has been more stable in the last six months - making it the better pick among the two. Elon Musk has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and the time (and money) invested by the billionaire inventor on the Trump campaign is expected to yield strong returns for his companies if Trump wins. We detailed the entwined fates of Trump and Tesla in Musk's Trump Card: Will Tesla Be Boosted Or Totaled? and Can Trump Take Tesla Stock To $0? There is no denying that TSLA stock stands to gain big from a Trump win - both near- as well as long-term. Besides the personal camaraderie between Trump and Musk, Trump's frequent calls for higher tariffs for Chinese imports (including Chinese-made EVs) should directly help Tesla sell more cars in the U.S. Stocks of the two largest oil service companies in the world have had a very forgettable year, with both of them losing 25% of their value so far. But that could change very quickly if Trump emerges victorious. Trump's support for oil and gas companies will reflect in favorable policies by his administration policies toward conventional energy companies which took a backseat to renewable energy companies under Biden's administration. Schlumberger and Halliburton stand out in particular among oil and gas companies because their stocks are less volatile in the near term than those of diversified energy companies such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron. And both SLB and HAL figure among the most undervalued Energy stocks in our analysis. Several of Trump's poll promises look better for U.S. businesses as a whole - particularly his talks about additional cuts to corporate taxes. The round of tax cuts he introduced in 2017 had a tangible impact on overall business sentiment and banks benefited in particular from the increased level of activity across industries. We expect a similar benefit for banks this time, too, if Trump returns, with the diversified banking giants gaining the most due to their strong presence in retail, private, commercial as well as corporate banking services. Both BAC and C are good picks in the event of a Trump win as we believe they are among the most undervalued Diversified Bank stocks All the stocks above are great near-term picks in the event Trump wins the U.S. elections. But that is not the only possible outcome of this election. And election-related trends will soon give way to long-term trends across industries. In the long run, the stocks you pick should add value to your portfolio without being too volatile. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the period 2021-2023. And as a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures were moving higher early Monday ahead of a busy week that includes the presidential election and a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) shares were lower after the Warren Buffet-led conglomerate reported declining earnings while reducing its holdings of Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) moved higher ahead of their inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow (DOW). Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares decline despite analysts seeing 26% jump in quarterly revenue in upcoming earnings report. Boeing (BA) shares were up ahead of a vote today from its machinists union on a new labor contract that would end a nearly two-month workers strike. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures trended higher premarket as market watchers are bracing for a week that includes Election Day on Tuesday and a key Federal Reserve interest-rate decision on Thursday. Investors look to build on the gains from Friday’s session, when stocks moved higher after all three major indexes closed October in the red. Oil prices were higher by more than 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with allies that include Russia, announced it would extend output cuts through December. Treasury yields were slightly lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury at around 4.28%. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway reported that its profits fell in the third quarter as it trimmed its holdings of both Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago and $11.6 billion in the prior quarter. It also reported a record level of cash holdings at $320.3 billion, up from $271.5 billion in the second quarter. The Warren Buffet-led company also said it had paused share buybacks. Berkshire Hathaway shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Apple and Bank of America also traded lower. Chipmaker Nvidia will replace rival semiconductor manufacturer Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while paint producer Sherwin-Williams will also join the blue-chip index in place of chemical firm Dow. S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes to the index will come before the start of trading on Friday, Nov. 8. Nvidia’s inclusion in the index comes as its share price has surged on demand for artificial intelligence (AI), while Intel’s shares have lost more than half of their value this year. Shares of Nvidia traded higher by more than 2% in premarket trading, while Sherwin-Williams shares gained more than 4%. Shares of both Intel and Dow traded lower. Palantir Technologies shares were more than 1% lower ahead of the software provider's third-quarter earnings report, due after markets close today. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are projecting that Palantir will grow its revenue by 26% in the quarter to $704.9 million, while its expected earnings per share of 5 cents would be up from 3 cents per share a year earlier. Shares of Palantir are up nearly 40% since September, but of the 12 analysts covering Palantir, only two projected a further rise in the company’s shares, with the average price target of $27.55 coming in 34% lower than its Friday closing price. Shares of Boeing edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a vote today by the aerospace giant’s machinist union that could end the strike that has lasted nearly two months. The International Association of Machinists will vote on the new offer from Boeing that includes 38% pay increases, along with a ratification bonus that workers can elect to use as part of their retirement savings. The union rejected a previous offer from Boeing that included a 35% pay hike, extending the strike that began on Sept. 13. Boeing recently raised around $19 billion in stock and depositary share sales as the company looks to shore up its finances.

Pokarna stock declined 1.31% on the NSE to ₹1,082.30 Afcons Infrastructure’s discount listing was in line with our expectations driven by market sentiments and lower than expected subscription. The subdued demand for IPO offer was mainly on the back of higher OFS by parent which is facing a challenging phase marked by significant debt and family business restructuring. The fund raised will help the parent better manage obligations, debt crisis in the other group companies. This objective was a hurdle for short term investors to bid aggressively. Despite the listing below issue price, we remain optimistic on the business long term growth. Long term rationale to invest and hold is justified mainly on the back of a Healthy order book supporting its future growth, strong Track record of executing complex, challenging and unique EPC projects both within India and internationally and Stable financial performance over the years along with a capable efficient management team to take the company to newer heights. For allotted investors, we recommend holding it for the long term as we believe long term growth is intact with Govt focus on infrastructure growth. Short term traders and investors can hold/accumulate more on dips with a target near to Rs 480-500.

The listing performance reflects the cautious market outlook, despite the company’s strong credentials as part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group and a solid order book supporting future growth. While the discounted listing may disappoint short-term investors, the IPO’s reasonable pricing, along with Afcons’ stable financial performance and project pipeline, offer potential long-term value. Investors with a long-term outlook may consider holding onto their shares, as the company’s fundamentals could drive gradual value appreciation once market conditions stabilize. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Conference call Replay available in Various speeds !
